BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
cc: chest pain
HPI: This is a 75 yo woman with h/o DMII , CAD. Over past 2-3 months
the patient has had burning epigastric pain. Previous anginal chest
pain per pt. was chest tightness , but given her history of CAD her
epigastric pain has been investigated for an ischemic cause. The
patient underwent PET CT 2 months prior that revealed an LvEF of 70% ,
no wall motion abnormalities , and inferiolateral and basal
anterolateral wall ischemia ( reversible at rest ) , in the distribution
of the LCx. She presented to her PCP 6/11 to review these findings and
complained of current epigastric burning. She was sent as a direct
admit for evaluation of ischemia and possible catheterization.
PMH: GERD , HTN , DMII , CAD LAD/Lcx/OM , CVA
w/ resolving Rt. hemiparesis , s/p CCY ,
osteoporosis , hyperplastic rectal polyp , ASCUS
98 allergies: NKDA
SH: does not smoke or drink Exam: Tm AF P 46 , BP 138/70 sat
99%RA PE: notable for physiologic split S2 ,
prominent S2 , no murmurs/rubs/gallops , o/w normal
exam. EKG: old 1mm st depressions v4-6 ,
I. Labs: troponin &lt; assay.
Impression: This is a 75 yo woman with multivessel CAD with epigastric
burning , possibly GERD but given risk for ischemia and positive PET
CT deserves diagnostic catherization and intervention to relieve any
pain caused by ischemia.
Hospital Course.
1. card - ischemia: The patient ruled out for acute myocardial
infarction by EKG and cardiac biomarkers. She was continued on her
outpatient regimen of ASA/BB/statin/ACEI/plavix. Left heart
catheterization performed 8/15 shows LCx disease with an 80% mid LCx
lesion opened to 0% with TAXUS stenting. Additionally , a TAXUS stent
was applied to an 80% ostial occlusion of the OM1 with no residual
occlusion. RCA disease was present with proximal 40% and ostial
50% occlusions that required no intervention.
During the procedure the patient experienced bradycardia to 38 and
SBP 86. IV fluids were given with recovery of systolic pressure to 90 -
150s , and HR 40s. The patient was asymptomatic during this event , and
has not had any complications. The patient experienced bleeding after
the procedure and integrilin was stopped after two hours of treatment.
The patient has had no further episodes of bleeding or associated chest
pain and is discharged in excellent condition on her outpatient
regimen.
rhythm - the patient was asymptomatic at a rate of 40s - 50s during
her hospital course. Titration of her beta-blockade as an outpt. may
be considered if the patient becomes symptomatic.
2. GI - continue H2 blocker , switch to nexium if continued pain.
3. Endo - Hypoglycemics were held until after the procedure and should
be resumed on discharge.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. resume your previous medications
2. you have had two new stents placed to keep the vessels around you
heart open.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. f/u rate control as outpt , adjust BB if pt. symptomatic from
bradycardia
