questionable small atrial septal defect.

q.8h. for seven days , NPH 30 units q. AM and 20 units q. PM.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.2 , heart rate
81 , blood pressure 160/70. LUNGS: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft and non-tender.
EXTREMITIES: Pulses palpable in the femoral , carotid and radial
pulses , right dorsalis pedis graft pulse was 2+ palpable with 1+
dorsalis pedis dopplerable pulses on the left. The great toe had a
medial wet ulcer as well as a right plantar ulcer that was dry with
an eschar of about 2 cm. The left leg had 2+ pitting edema with
increased asymmetry to the knee and the left great toe showed some
fibrinous exudate without any pus.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was placed on ampicillin ,
levofloxacin and Flagyl. He was planned to go
the operating room the next day for a left great toe debridement.
Preoperatively , he was seen by Cardiology who recommended that we
double his dose of simvastatin to 20 mg and increase the Lopressor
to 25 mg q.i.d. and otherwise , he was cleared for surgery. On
August , 2002 , the patient was taken to the operating room for a
left foot debridement and left great toe amputation. This was done
under spinal anesthesia. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and on postoperative day number one , he had a VAC sponge placed to
the wound. He tolerated having the VAC sponge on and was able to
ambulate heel weight bearing only with the VAC sponge.
Cardiology followed the patient and recommended that we change him
to atenolol and add Tricor as an anticholesterol drug.
The Diabetes Management Service was also consulted to help with the
patient's fingersticks and we increased his NPH as well as added
regular insulin in the AM and PM.
On January , 2002 , the VAC sponge was taken down and wet to dry
dressing was placed over it. At this time , it was felt that the
wound was not ready for a skin graft yet and the plan was to
discharge him to rehabilitation for wet to dry dressing changes
until the wound was ready for skin grafts.
Thus , the patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition to continue wet to dry dressing changes as well as to
continue a course of vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl for two
more weeks.
