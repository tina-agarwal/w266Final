Discharge Date: 5/13/2005
ATTENDING: LORENSON , REED MD
SERVICE:
RBMC . 
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Rule out MI.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Angina , tachycardia , and hypertension.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , chest pain , GERD , coronary artery disease ,
osteoarthritis , anxiety , diverticulosis , hypercholesterolemia ,
and chronic dizziness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with history of coronary
artery disease and difficult to control hypertension who
presented with chest pain in the setting of the elevated blood
pressure and tachycardia. Two days prior to admission , the
patient had developed the abrupt onset of palpitation , chest
pain , diaphoresis , anxiety , and shortness of breath. She took
her blood pressure and this was found to be greater than 200 with
the rapid pulse. She called her PCP and was instructed to call
911. She was taken to the Ha Hstibrook Medical Center ED. Of
note , she had not taken her Toprol-XL for the prior three days.
In the emergency department , the systolic blood pressure was in
the 180s. This was controlled with her home medications and IV
Lopressor. The patient was ruled out for an MI in ED/OBS. She
went for a MIBI on the morning of admission , but this was
canceled because the patient was dizzy. Of note , the patient has
had an identical admission several months earlier for a labile
blood pressure. During that admission , the patient's hydralazine
and beta-blocker was titrated up with improved blood pressure
control. She was ruled out for pheochromocytoma and renal
artery stenosis. She did have elevated plasma metanephrines
during that admission. She was discharged at that point on an
improved antihypertensive regimen as described above. She also
reports having had a similar episode two weeks ago.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , angina , osteoarthritis , GERD , diverticulosis ,
hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease status post CABG x4 and
multiple stents , chronic dizziness , stable cath 11/22 .

ALLERGIES:
ACE inhibitor , amlodipine , and niacin.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No smoking , no ethanol. She lives in West O Uxkan by herself , has a
helper ( visiting aid ). No family nearby. Her family lives in
Pit Forda Sta
FAMILY HISTORY:
Her brother died at 61 years old of CVA. Her mother died at 75
years old with CVA. Her sister had an MI at age 80.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Vital signs: Heart rate 98 , blood pressure 172/70 with a range
of 103-172/40-70. O2 saturation was 97% on room air. Her exam
was significant for tachycardia with a regular rate , normal S1
and S2 , and soft systolic ejection murmur at the right upper
sternal border. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
CBC was within normal limits. Chem-7 was significant for BUN of
22 and creatinine of 103. Calcium was 10.5 , phosphorus was 2.5 ,
and albumin was 4.3. LFTs were normal. Her D-dimer was 1305.
She had two sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Coags were normal.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 75 beats per minute ,
left axis deviation , LVH , left atrial enlargement. T-wave
flatting in lead III only.
STUDIES:
1. Chest x-ray ( 4/24/05 ): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. PE CT ( 3/22/05 ): No PE.
3. Head CT ( 3/22/05 ): Left-sided meningiomas , unchanged from
2004.
4. MIBI ( 5/18/05 ): Area of reversible ischemia , unchanged from
2002.
CONSULTS:
Cardiology ( FMCO ): Luke Ollie Buckley .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: This was in the setting
of not taking her Toprol. She does have a history of labile
blood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. This
symptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , but
this was ruled out last admission. Renal artery stenosis was
also ruled out last admission. Given the description and the
fact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previous
admission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudo
pheochromocytoma. Studies for pheochromocytoma , pseudo
pheochromocytoma , carcinoid , and hypothyroidism ( including
24-hour urine metanephrines were sent ) these all returned as
negative. Her TSH was normal. She was initially put on q.i.d.
Lopressor and hydralazine. The hydralazine was then discontinued
due to hypotension. Her Lopressor was changed to Toprol-XL , this
was also discontinued for hypotension. Her ultimate regimen was
titrated based on her blood pressures and eventually she was put
on Avapro 75 mg daily , atenolol 25 mg daily , and her home dose of
Imdur 120 mg daily. Her target blood pressures were 140s to 150s
and with this regimen , she was well controlled and asymptomatic
upon discharge.
2. Ischemia: She was initially ruled out for MI. Her MIBI
showed reversible ischemia unchanged from 2002 despite two
catheterizations in intervening time. She was seen by LMH
Cardiology , and this defect was felt to be nonintervenable. She
was discharged home in stable condition and chest pain free.
3. Dizziness/nausea: She had episodes of this during her
hospitalization. It was of unclear etiology and she has had a
previous significant prior workup ( see previous discharge
summary ). She received p.r.n. meclizine and Compazine and was
discharged home without any dizziness or nausea.
4. Calcium: She had borderline high calcium and a PTH was sent
and returned mildly elevated. This will need to be followed up
as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Stable.
TO DO PLAN:
Further workup for question of elevated PTH in the setting of
high calcium suggestive of hyperparathyroidism.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily.
3. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg daily.
5. Ibuprofen 400 mg q.8h. p.r.n. pain.
6. Lactulose 30 mL p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. constipation.
7. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. daily p.r.n. anxiety.
8. Meclizine 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. dizziness.
9. Nitroglycerin 1/150 one tablet sublingual every five minutes
x3 doses p.r.n. chest pain.
10. Compazine 10mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea.
