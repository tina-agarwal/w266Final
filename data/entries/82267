ASSESSMENT:
A 41-year-old female , long standing aplastic anemia transfusion
dependent , history of avascular necrosis , history of multiple
infections , who came in with decreased mental status as well as
leg pain. Subsequently found to have urosepsis as well as a
Klebsiella bacteremia with course complicated by development of a
cholecystitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. ID: Blood cultures grew Klebsiella as well as urine culture
grew Klebsiella , determined to be a urosepsis During her hospital
course. Was hypotensive requiring transport to the MICU as well
as pressors. She was initially treated with ceftazidine that had
been ??_____?? levofloxacin when her cultures came back
sensitive. Also hospital course complicated by development of
cholecystitis. She was started on amp as well as Flagyl to cover
for her cholecystitis in addition to the Levaquin. She was to
complete a 10-day course of amp , levo , Flagyl after her last
positive culture , which would take her up until 2/25 to
discontinue the antibiotics. Prior to discharge additional blood
culture was collected to ensure that she had cleared her
bacteremia prior to replacing the Hickman line. This blood
culture should be followed up before the Hickman line is placed.
2. Neuro. Patient had decreased mental status as well as pain
on admission. Baseline , she does have chronic pain and is high
dose of oxycodone as well as methadone at home. However , on
admission , she had acute full body pain. This pain improved as
her infection was treated and returned to her baseline level.
Her mental status , which according to her daughter , she is
frequently somnolent , was decreased from baseline. However , as
her sepsis resolved , her somnolence improved.
3. Pulmonary. During hospital course had one episode of dry
cough with scant hemoptysis in the setting of low platelets. Her
cough did not persist and her oxygen saturation at the time of
discharge was 95% on room air.
4. Cardiovascularwise from a pump perspective , her EF was 35%
with global hypokinesis , trace AI. Initially she was fluid
overloaded following resuscitation; however , autodiuresed. She
was restarted on hydrochlorothiazide for her hypertension.
Rythmwise , initially she had sinus tachycardia in the setting of
her sepsis. Then on 2/12 , developed atrial flutter with rates
up to 150s. She was given IV Lopressor , when she converted back
to sinus rhythm. She was then continued on p.o. metoprolol for
rate control. She was not anticoagulated due to her low
platelets and bleeding risk.
5. Vascular: It was noted that she did have swollen lower
extremity that was tender , right greater than left , after
transfer out from the MICU. Pulses were intact. She was able to
move her feet. ??_____?? were performed and did not show any
evidence of DVT. Her swelling continued to decrease as she
diuresed.
6. GI: During her MICU stay , she developed right upper quadrant
pain and ultrasound suggestive of cholecystitis. Surgery was
consulted; however , due to her high surgical risk , it was decided
that she would be managed medically. Her bilirubin continued to
trend down. She continued to tolerate p.o. liquids and food and
did not complain of a new right upper quadrant pain. Given her
chronic esophagitis , as well as epigastric discomfort , she was
kept on a PPI. In addition , she may also continue Carafate as
needed. She also has a history of hepatitis C , which she is to
follow with Liver Clinic following discharge.
7. Heme: She has a history of aplastic anemia of unknown
etiology since age 12. She was maintained with a hematocrit goal
of greater than 23. Her platelets fluctuated as low as 3. She
did receive two units of HLA matched platelets , which increased
her platelets to 19. However , in the past she has been known to
tolerate platelets less than 5 and unless a concern for bleeding ,
I would not further transfuse.
8. Renal: Her creatinine was maintained at her baseline of 1.5.
Electrolytes were fallena and repleted as necessary.
9. Endocrine: Diabetes. Her sugar levels were difficult to
control. She was kept on Lantus as well as Novolog for her
insulin regimen.
PROPHYLAXIS:
Pneumaboots given her low platelets as well as a PPI.
TUBES , LINES AND DRAINS:
She does have a 3 port right IJ catheter in place and which she
will be discharged with until her Hickman can be placed. Follow
up has been scheduled for her to have IR place another Hickman.
Prior to placement , she should have her final blood cultures
evaluated.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Include Dulcolax 10-20 mg ??_____?? p.r.n. constipation , Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily , Levoxyl
