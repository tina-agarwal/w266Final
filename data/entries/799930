BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: Ms. Phetteplace is a 70 yo woman with h/o Cardiac Transplant 1992 , s/p
PCI/Stent 6/15 with 80% lesion LCx s/p R Carotid stent placement 6/15 ,
h/o DM , HTN , Hyperlipidemia , Smoking , now s/p L Carotid Stent Placement
1/10/06 .  During annual follow up in 9/24 of her heart transplant , a
complex eccentric 80% lesion was noted in the proximal LCx. She was
admitted in March electively with plans for cardiac cath/PCI/stent.
However in the interim period , she had a symptomatic LUE numbness thought
to be a TIA , concerning for R carotid stenosis.An MRI revealed bilateral
tight carotid stenosis. The LCx and Symptomatic R Carotid artery
underwent cath/stent placement in 6/15 .  However , intervention on her
left internal carotid artery ( though 90% occluded by cath ) was deferred
due to already receiving 2 angiographikc procedures during the 6/15
admission. At this time she was tapered off cell-cept and started on
rapamycin - in hopes of slowing progression in her coronary disease. She
then returned to medical attention on 16 of May for catheterization/stent
placement on Left Carotid Artery. During these procedure , a hematoma
developed at the L femoral access site which was managed with compression
during the case. FSBS was 384 prior to the procedure and elevated to 547
during the procedure ( she received D5W+HCO3 during the procedure. ) She
was given 10 u regular insulin x 2 and her FSBS declined to 400s. Her
post-procedure course has been complicated by hyperglycemia and hematoma
formation with a Hct drop of 30 ` 22.
PMH:
1.	TIA Patient taken to cath lab after RUE numbness c/w TIA 6/15 . 
Bilateral carotid stenoses were seen by angiography. Stenting of R
internal carotid artery performed
2.	CAD: Coronary angiography/PCI of LCx lesion. Cypher stent.
Discharged on ASA/Plavix.
3.	Heart Transplant Recipient: 1992 2/2 end stage ischemic
cardiomyopathy. Was switched from cellcept and cyclosporine to
rapamycin/cyclosporine during 6/15 admission because of concern of
progression of coronary disease within the allograft. Last Echo 8/13
LV sized decrease , normal overall function. EF 65%. No RWMA. RV Nl
Size/thickness/function. Severe LAE/Mild RAE c/w transplant. No change
from 6/15 study.
4.	Hypercholesterolemia
5.	DJD Spine
6.	Type II DM since 1992
7.	Gastritis
8.	H/o GIB

Assessment: Ms. Poehlein is a 70 yo woman with h/o Cardiac Transplant
1992 , s/p PCI/Stent 6/15 with 80% lesion LCx s/p R Carotid stent
placement 6/15 , h/o DM , HTN , Hyperlipidemia , Smoking , now s/p L Carotid
Stent Placement 1/10/06 with postprocedure course complicated by hematoma
formation causing acute on chronic anemia , and hyperglycemia.
Labs/Studies:
Chol: Chol 354 , TG 1383 , HDL 29 ( Up from 9/4 Chol 267 , TG 677 , HDL 29 )
HbA1c 11.1 ( up from 2/3 6.9 )
1. Heme: Patient had r femoral hematoma due to bleeding around sheath and
causing fluctuation in Hct. HCT currently stable without transfusions.
Site non-pulsatile and no bruits. Transfusing 1 U pRBC 3/18 for goal
Hct&gt;28.
2. CV( Ischemia ): Patient h/o ischemic CM s/p heart transplant with
evidence of CAD on allograft. Patient medically managed with pravachol ,
aspirin and plavix. Now s/p bilateral carotid stents and stent to LCx.
Attempt to change immunosuppressive regiments to rapamycin in order to
lower progression of CAD however on this regiment , her cholesterol panel
has markedly worsened. Have stopped rapamycin ( 3/18 ) and restarting
cellcept and cyclosporine at prior doses. Will need review in clinic in
30 days with bilateral carotid ultrasounds.
CV( Pump ): Clinically appears euvolemic. On Toprol , restarting lasix at
home dose ( 9/27 ).
CV( Rhythm ): On telemetry , no events seen.
3. Endo: During hospitalization and prior/during procedures has had poor
glucose controls with FSBS in 300s-400s. Patient reports poor glycemic
control at home with FSBS in 300s. AM FSBS was 384 and received D5NS
prior to procedure , exacerbating hyperglycemia. Endocrinconsulted and
recommended Qday lantus injection with with Novolog sliding scale + AC
while in house. HbA1c @ 11 ( markedly worse than 6 in March ) - patient can
not identify other factors which have changed since March other than
immunosuppressants to rapamycin. FSBS were difficult to control in house
despite using 20 QDay of lantus , Ms. Nickodem FSBS continued to run in
the 200s-300s during the day. She was taught to inject herself with
insulin SC during her stay. She is discharged on Glyburide 10 QDay and
Lantus 20 QDay. She was taught to keep a diary and will follow up with her
PCP.
4. Neuro: TIA/CVA in 6/15 .  residual Left numbness/weakness in hand. On
plavix and asa , now s/p R and L Carotid Stents.
5. Immunosuppression: As above , have changed immunosuppression from
Rapamycin + Cyclosporine back to Cyclosporine 75 BID +Cellcept 1000 BID as
patient performed priorto 6/15 . 
6. MSK/Rheum: The patient previously complained of myalgias with statins and
was resistant to starting statins because they seemed to worsen her
aches/pains. Rheumatology service was consulted. They believed her pain
is not consistent with statin associated myalgia. Zetia was stopped and
she was started on Pravachol 20 mg QHS.
Her back pain is relieved by leaning forward and she walks at Arkansas
with a shopping cart for exercise which is consistent with spinal stenosis.
They recommended physical therapy and MRI imaging of her back. The MRI
preliminary read shows multilevel degenerative disc disease and moderate
spinal stenosis at one level. Physical therapy saw her and thought she
would benefit from home PT in the future--she was given a prescription for
outpatient physical therapy.
Since she is on long term prednisone she should have a DEXA scan and may
benefit from bisphosphonate therapy.
