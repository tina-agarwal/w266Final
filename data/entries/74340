Discharge Date: 7/10/2006
ATTENDING: SOLTANI , LEON M.D.
SERVICE:
General Medicine Service Ri
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
OTHER PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS TREATED:
LGL NKA lymphoma with pancytopenia , type II diabetes ,
hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , genital herpes , PICC
line infection , nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Seligson is an 88-year-old Italian-speaking female with a history
of large granulocytic lymphocyte lymphoma complicated by
pancytopenia with chronic transfusion requirement. She also has
a history of type II diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency , and a
recent herpes infection undergoing treatment with famciclovir who
presented with fever , chills , cough , and decreased p.o. intake
from her nursing home with moderate hypotension to systolic
pressures of 80 at the nursing home as well as oxygen saturation
of 91% and on admission was found to have fever without
neutropenia later diagnosed with an MSSA bacteremia and a
component of acute on chronic renal failure.
ALLERGIES:
Fentanyl which caused GI intolerance , lisinopril which causes
cough , morphine which causes vomiting and Percocet which causes
nausea and vomiting.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature of 98.4 , a pulse of 100 , a BP of 143/64 with a
respiratory rate of 20 with a O2 saturation of 100% on 3 liters.
This is post 4 liters of IV fluids and six packs of platelets in
the emergency department at which point she had presented with a
fever to 101 with a initial systolic pressure of 146 over a
diastolic of 91 that had dropped to 100 systolic. In the ED , she
also received vancomycin , levofloxacin , Flagyl , and ceftazidime
as well her PICC line which is present in the right upper
extremity was pulled. A physical examination on admission was
significant for tachycardia with an otherwise normal cardiac exam
without murmurs. Her respiratory exam showed decreased air
movement bilaterally with expiratory wheezes , however , no
evidence of focal decrease in breath sounds. The abdominal exam
was benign and the extremities showed erythema and induration at
the right former PICC site.
ADMISSION LABORATORY:
Significant for sodium of 131 , potassium of 4.9 , bicarbonate of
20 , BUN and creatinine of 63/2.9 up from her baseline of 2. Her
white blood cell count on admission was 4.5 with a hematocrit of
23.7 and platelets of 20.
Urinalysis showed 3+ protein , 1+ blood , 1+ bacteria and 2-4 white
blood cells. An admission troponin was drawn and that was less
than assay.
Her EKG showed a sinus tachycardia with poor R-wave progression
and T-wave flattening in III and AVF. The chest x-ray was
performed on admission that showed right-sided subsegmental
basilar atelectasis with low lung volumes and a large cardiac
silhouette , but no definitive infiltrate or fusion.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
8/20/06: PICC line placement in the left upper extremity.
8/20/06: CAT scan of the chest.
11/3/06: Right upper extremity Doppler ultrasound and chest
x-rays were performed on 4/7/06 , 03 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
ID: Based on blood culture results the patient had an MSSA
bacteremia. She was initially treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics in the emergency department , however , this regimen
was tapered to initially include vancomycin as a single agent and
then further tapered to naphthalene but this was also tapered
finally to a regimen of Ancef dosed at 0.5 g IV q. 12h. Her last
positive blood culture was on 4/18/06 and the Ancef should be
continued for 14 days thereafter setting an end date of
approximately 0/16/06 .  She completed her course of famciclovir
during hospitalization and had no further evidence of genital
herpetic infection as well the urine culture and urinalysis data
described above showed yeast only and a Foley that had been
intermittently placed during the ED stay was discontinued , and
the patient remained asymptomatic for any further urinary tract
infection.
Cardiovascular: Although the patient initially had transient
hypertension believed to be secondary to infection and mild
hypovolemia in the setting of diuretics and poor p.o. intake
prior to coming in. She was electively fluid resuscitated and
actually went into mild hypervolemia as evidenced by chest x-ray
findings consistent with pulmonary edema initially. She was
thereafter diuresed as needed. During her hospitalization as her
hemodynamic status stabilized her home blood pressure regimen was
reinstated. However , the following substitutions were made. The
hydrochlorothiazide was substituted with Lasix as her chronic
renal insufficiency dictated as well as her doxazosin dose was
increased from 2 mg per day to 4 mg per day for better blood
pressure control. Her metoprolol dose , which was initially 100
mg twice a day was changed the 62.5 mg four times daily , which
can be converted as her blood pressure normalizes. Captopril and
ARBs were not used due to her history of allergies but additional
antihypertensive medications may be indicated if her pressure
remains elevated. During the hospitalization , she had evidence
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia asymptomatic on
telemetry , however , with alteration of the dose of Lopressor
there was no further evidence of this. At the time of discharge ,
she was euvolemic from a pulmonary standpoint with mild lower
extremity edema. He discharge weight is 71.1 kilograms and her
daily weights should be followed and the Lasix titrated to remain
euvolemic. There was no evidence of ischemia during the
hospitalization.
Pulmonary: Although she presented with some shortness of breath
and cough she did not continue to have any shortness of breath or
cough during the hospitalization. Due to complaints of right
posterior rib pain during the hospitalization without evidence of
any skin or soft tissue abnormalities she underwent a CT scan of
the chest on 2/5/06 , which showed a small right middle lobe
area of consolidation favoring atelectasis but not impossible to
represent an early pneumonia. They also had tiny pleural
effusions bilaterally as well as a tiny pericardial effusion , a
small calcified right apical node , and an enlarged left thyroid
lobe with extension below the sternum. There was no evidence of
rib fracture or soft tissue abnormality on this CAT scan in the
area of concern. The pain caused by this symptom , which is still
unclear was treated with Lidoderm patch as well as Tylenol 650 mg
p.o. q. 6h. standing with only modest relief. Other medications
including other narcotics and NSAIDS were not used given her
history of allergies as well as her thrombocytopenia. However ,
these can be further evaluated in the outpatient setting.
Hematology/oncology: The patient has a history of LGL NK
lymphoma. There is no inpatient treatment for this disease;
however , she received transfusions of packed red blood cells for
her hematocrit less than 22 and platelet scales were set as 10.
She also received GCSF during her hospitalization and should
receive her Neulasta in the outpatient setting. Prior to
discharge a left upper extremity PICC line was placed on 2/5/06
and confirmed on chest x-ray with its tip projecting over the
superior vena cava.
Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency
with a component of acute renal failure at the time of admission
as her baseline creatinine increased from 2 to 2.9 , however , her
creatinine returned to her baseline with IV hydration initially
and has remained at 1.9-2 stably prior to discharge.
Endocrine: This patient has a history of type II diabetes
initially managed on Glucotrol in the outpatient setting. She
was placed on NPH twice daily in the hospital and will be
discharged on 10 units twice daily with a insulin aspartate
sliding scale prior to meals. Her blood glucose is not optimally
controlled but more aggressive attempts to control her glucose
resulted in symptomatic hypoglycemia , therefore it was felt best
to air on the side of mildly elevated blood glucoses in the range
of 150 to the low 200s in order to avoid transient hypoglycemia.
The incidental finding of the left thyroid lobe enlargement on
the CT of the chest should be evaluated in the outpatient setting
and this may be done in collaboration with the endocrine service ,
however , the projection to the retrosternal space may preclude
most evaluation.
The patient was followed by physical therapy during the
hospitalization and will continue to have physical therapy in the
outpatient setting. There were no complications during the
hospitalization. Her physical examination at the time of
discharge reveals a temperature of 97.2 , heart rate of 71-93 , a
blood pressure of 130-150/57-80 , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation of 96%-99% on room air with a lung exam showing
minimal bibasilar crackles. A cardiac exam with regular rate and
rhythm , S1 , S2 , no murmurs and abdominal exam showing obese
abdomen with ventral hernia but otherwise benign and lower
extremities with 1+ edema and nontender. A PICC line in the left
upper extremity and no erythema in the right upper extremity ,
however , resolving induration and minimal tenderness. Her
fingerstick glucose on the a.m. of discharge was 91. Her
discharge labs show a potassium of 4.2 , sodium of 136 , creatinine
of 2 , magnesium of 1.7 , which is repleted. A white blood cell
count of 1 , hematocrit of 22.5 , platelets of 13 with 1% polys ,
86% lymphs , and 4% monocytes.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every six hours. This should be
continued standing until her right chest wall pain diminishes ,
Ben-Gay topical apply twice daily to back/right flank as
directed , Ancef 0.5 g IV q. 12h. should be continued until
0/16/06 , Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily , Lasix 40 mg by
mouth daily , insulin NPH 10 units subcutaneous b.i.d. , milk of
magnesia 30 ml by mouth daily as needed for constipation ,
Lopressor 62.5 mg by mouth four times daily , doxazosin 4 mg by
mouth daily , Lidoderm 5% patch may be applied daily as needed for
pain and it must have a 12 off period during the application ,
insulin aspartate sliding scale pre-meal , Maalox tablets ,
Spectazole one to two tablets by mouth every six hours as needed
for upset stomach and Protonix 40 mg by mouth daily.
She will be discharged to the Worth Ri and the
final results of the CT of the chest should be followed up. Dr.
Bernard Winge , her primary oncologist , has been notified of her
discharge and will continue to follow her in the outpatient
setting. The patient is full code and her healthcare proxy is
Rufus Kelderman , her son , at 968-934-7936.
