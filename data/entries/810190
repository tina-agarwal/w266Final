BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Tachycardia
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 59-year-old woman from Vi Ca Beth presents with fever and tachycardia
since 10/5/06 .  It is very difficult to elicit a clear story. The
patient has had cough productive of variably colored sputum ( yellow
to green to orange , without hemoptysis ) but it seems she may
have had a similar cough for months. Similarly , she notes dysuria
and increased frequency which it seems has also been present for
weeks to months. She is not short of breath and has no headache ,
chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
numbness , LE swelling , LE pain , rash. She does have some bumps on
her abdominal wall which are painful-it sounds like these are a
direct result of the enoxaprin she had been getting for a PE in
March of this year.
The ZH ER doctor spoke with Senz at the nursing home. She said
that the patient had an x-ray two days ago which revealed pneumonia ,
and her referral states that the pneumonia was in the left upper
lobe and left lower lobe; the patient was started on Levaquin 500 mg
p.o at that time. In the FMC emergency room , the patient was hydrated
with 3 liters of normal saline and her pulse still remains in the
130s. She was given Levofloxacin 500 mg IV. The ER physician was
worried about a pulmonary embolus , did not do a chest CT here
because of her elevated creatinine of 1.9. She was transferred to
the Chamvine Tionbradvar General Hospital for an MRA to rule out PE. In ER here , IJ central line
placed ( CVP~20 ) and patient given 1L NS. Blood pressure systolic
initially 120s but decreased to 90s ( MAPS&gt;70 ) , and norepinephrine
started. The NE was discontinued promptly given BP improvement
immediately , and continued
SBP&gt;100 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic breast CA-bone
scan which revealed widespread osseous metastasis , and
CNS involvement on head CT , bone marrow bx with invasive disease ,
status post brain radiotherapy 10/5 diabetes , PE 5/13 , tx with
enoxaprin through 0/7 ( discontinued because of doubt over original
dx and significant pain at injection sites ) , hypertension , arthritis ,
depression , bipolar disorder , asthma , high cholesterol , anemia , and
obesity.
ONC HISTORY: Pt presented with grade III , ER/PR/HER2-negative in
March 2004. In March 2004 , she underwent right breast lumpectomy
with pathology demonstrating 4.1 cm IDC , no LVI ,
negative sentinel lymph nodes. She underwent partial breast radiation
in March 2004 and deferred on adjuvant therapy. In November 2005 , she
presented with atypical chest wall pain and imaging showed bilateral
pulmonary nodules , thoracic lymphadenopathy , and pleural effusion
consistent with metastatic disease. A bone scan showed wide
spread osseous metastatic disease and head CT demonstrated a CNS
involvement. She was treated with whole brain radiotherapy in March
2006 and with weekly Taxol. She continued through March
2006. Restaging studies showed stable visceral disease but
progression of bony metastatic disease. Therefore on January , 2006 ,
she initiated a second-line Navelbine
therapy. PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 99.3po , pulse 112 regular ,
BP 120/75 , respirations 18 , sO2=100% on ambient air.
GENERAL APPEARANCE: Laying in bed , coughing paroxysms. No use of
accessory muscles. HEENT: Mucosa dry. No jaundice. +conjunctival
pallor. Pupils reactive bilaterally. NECK: Supple and nontender.
Right IJ in place. HEART: S1 , S2 , tachycardic without murmurs. No
heaves. LUNGS: Crackles in the left lower chest
posteriorly , and diffuse expiratory wheezes. ABDOMEN: Soft and
nontender. Small nodule RUQ subcutaneous , mildly tender to
palpation. BACK: No
CVAT. NEUROLOGIC: A&amp;Ox4 , but somewhat sedate and with
poor attention. Radial and DP pulses are 2+. Sensation and strength
are grossly intact. EXTREMITIES: No calf warmth , erythema , or
tenderness. Mild right heel and Achilles tendon tenderness.

9/13/06: No growth
Chest x-ray: Revealed questionable left lobe infiltrate with
metastasis. EKG: 120 per minute , sinus
tachycardia. CXR: LLL opacity , LUL opacity. Hilar fullness on
the righT&gt;l , and prominent bronchi ( ?cuffing ) on right. Vertebral
fractures. LLL unchanged from 0/0 , and LUL improved C/w known
metastatic disease.
ASSESSMENT: 59 year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer and a
history of pulmonary embolus presenting with one week of fatigue ,
lethargy , tachycardia and fever. History notable for
productive cough and dysuria , although the chronicity of these issues
is unclear. Now growing 1 bottle from WBH as well as NBH of GPC in
clusters empirically on Vanco , now looks to be coag
neg.Discussed with ID , would like to keep vanco PLAN:
*Tachycardia: Most likely secondary to an infection , either
pulmonary or urinary. With improvement in Cr PE CT was obtained which
was negative.Stable. d/c ASA and statin as no role for long term risk
reduction at this time.
*Cough: Productive cough , yellow to green sputum. Seems to have been
present for months , and it is unclear how much this has changed in
the past week. May be chronic secondary to tumor , or may
represent acute infection. Aspiration plausible given mental status.
The CT did not demonstrate any acute etiology for her symptoms.
*Dysuria: Again , chronicity unclear. UA and urine culture at HNH not
very suggestive of UTI , but UA here with 25 wbc and LE+. Has been on
levofloxacin , so will treat until cultures return with ceftazidime
( d/c 0/7 ). *Bacteremia: coag neg staph x2 , Vanc Sens , plan to
treat via PICC w/Vancomycin x14days *Oncology: Discussion with Dr.
Clusky , her primary oncologic fellow , who noted that from my
description the patient does not sound much different from her
baseline state. She is mildly tachycardic at baseline ( although not
to this degree ) , and has chronic productive cough and
dysuria. 5. Renal: ARF , improving with IVF. Likely prerenal
azotemia. 6.Heme: Chronic anemia. Given 1UPRBC in ER.
Unfortuantely , the blood was given before hemolysis or iron studies
sent. Would be indicated , especially in setting of markedly elevated
PT. Should be sent in future. I have called and added
on a peripheral manual blood smear. Last INR similarly elevated ( but
I believe patient was on enoxaprin at that time ). Not on enoxaprin
or warfarin now. May be dues to malnutrition , but
concerning for DIC or liver disease.Administered vitamin
K. 7.Psych: Resumed home zoloft , restart
geodon prn. 8.Goals of care: Discussed with the patient and
Dr. Pinion . The patient expresses that she wants to be intubated or
have defibrillation if needed. Dr. Ellestad has discussed this numerous
times with her , and will readdress.
