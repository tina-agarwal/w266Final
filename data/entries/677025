HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) CVS ( I ): Ruled out for MI. On baby ASA , statin , nitrate , low-dose BB.
Chol panel wnl in 1/29 ( chol 150 , TG 127 , HDL 51 , LDL 74 ). Had recurrent
nausea on 10/22 and 0/7 w chest tightness w dry heaves. Repeat EKG showed
min. changes ( TWI in v3-4 ) , but negative enzymes. Chest discomfort
appeared more related to cough/ retching than ischemia.
CVS ( P ): Mild-mod CHF on admission. On 20 po lasix at home. Attempted
diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV ( received 3 doses total in EDs/ floor ) w
unclear response. Good response to 40 iv lasix x 1 , with neg neg 1.6L.
Wt down from 97 on admit to 93.6 ( though bed vs. standing ). JVP remained
somewhat elevated to 8-10cm , though may be confounded by pt's mild TR.
O2sats quickly returned to baseline , 96% 2L. Followed 'lytes , strict I/O ,
qd weights , and low-salt diet. Of note , Cr was elevated to 1.7 on admit
( from baseline of 1.2-1.4 ) and remained stable with diuresis.
CVS ( R ): NSR. Maintained on telemetry for r/o MI. Tele notable for 5b run
NSVT and several pauses ( &lt;2sec each ). Pt asymptomatic.
2 ) PULM/ID: CXR d/o lobar pneumonia. Covered with vanc/levoflox initially ,
then switched to linezolid/levo , given pt's hx of MRSA in sputum. Sputum
cx on this admission showed Staph aureus , not MRSA , and was changed to
diclox. continued advair , duonebs q4 , antitussive , supplemental O2.
6 ) RENAL: Acute elev of Cr ?2/2 chf exacerbation vs intravascular vol
depletion in setting of infection. . Since could be redistribution of
volume , diuresed v. gently/cautiously. Cr stable following diuresis at
1.7. UA at CH notable for +LE/ nitr/ 20 wbc. Urine cx here neg w 100 GNR.
Foley was placed at pshc , was d/c'd here post-diuresis on 6/11
7 ) GI: Nexium for epigastric pain ( more likely related to
coughing ). Recurrent nausea likely related to coughing/nebs/ abx vs.
constipation vs ischemia ( ruled out ). Treated with reglan iv , bowel
regimen. KUB pending.
8 ) HEME: hct 33.5 , MCV 70 , +iron def ( Fe 31 in 3/24 , TIBC 445 , ferr 32 ) ,
No scopes on record. Guaiced all stool. Hct remained stable at 30-34.
Discuss outpatient colonoscopy , though pt at age 82 , may not wish to
pursue this option. Started iron suppl.
9 ) ENDO: DM , diet controlled. Covered here w RISS. ADA diet. FS ranged
100-200s. Last HbA1c in 1/29 was 5.3. TSH 0.556
10 ) FEN: low salt/ fat/chol , ADA diet , 2L FR
11 ) PPX: heparin , nexium
12 ) DERM: Nystatin cream/miconazole powder to intertriginous areas. H/o
cellulitis under L.breast , and though this area looked macerated , it was
not warm/tender , likely still candidiasis rather than bacterial
infection.
