and normal position sense. He has diminished reflexes throughout
but downgoing toes bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: He had a glucose of 323 , but otherwise
normal admission laboratories except for
an LDH of 529 and an alkaline phosphatase of 151. Admission CK was
138 , amylase of 56 , lipase of 52. Hemoglobin A1C 8.3 , cholesterol
170 , UA shows 2+ glucose. Chest x-ray shows a normal size heart
with clear lungs. EKG shows sinus at 70 with normal axis and
intervals. There are flat T waves in I , L , and III , but no change
from a previous EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent Holter monitoring in which
he had no arrhythmias. He occasionally had sinus
tachycardia. An exercise test showed that he went six minutes and
17 seconds of a standard Bruce protocol. His maximum heart rate
was 140 and blood pressure was 210/60. There were no EKG changes
with the exception of unifocal PVCs , so that there was no evidence
