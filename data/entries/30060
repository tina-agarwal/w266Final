BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: chest pain
HPI: 58 y/o women with h/o CAD , s/p MI w/ LAD stent 2004 , HTN ,
hyperlipdemia , complex PMHX admitted with 1 day h/o SSCP. Pt has had
multiple admissions and ED visits ( approx &gt; 10 ) for chest
pain over the past several months since May .  Her most recent
cardiac work-up includes a MIBI ( 8/27/06 ) which demonstrated a mild
small fixed perfusion defect in inferior-basal region - likely
representing soft tissue attenuation and a CTA which is negative for
aortic dissection in 9/6/06 .  Pt was in her USOH until several days
PTA when she developed occ palpitations. At 5PM of the
evening of admission she developed lightheadedness and ringing in her
ears and subsequently developed SSCP radiation to her back and
bilateral shoulders and left arm. + SOB. Chest pain intensity 10/10
and similar to pain of prior MI and similar to mult prior visits.
EMS called and pt given SL NTG without relief. Pain lasted approc 2
hours and was ultimately relived with morphine in the ED. In
addition , pt report a recent bilateral lower ext cellulites treated
with 7days of levo. Pt continues to have some warmth and erythema in
her bilateral lower ext. Last admit here 1/5 w/ EGD
confirming gastro-jejunal anastamotic ulcer - told to hold ASA and
Plavix , but has been taking. In ED , given morphine 6 mg IV , asa , and
ativan and admitted to GMS.
