Discharge Date: 4/3/2005
ATTENDING: WOJNICKI , HOLLIS MD
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS DURING THIS ADMISSION:
Decompensated heart failure.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Non-ST elevation MI.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 61-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy and
chronic renal insufficiency who presented with volume overload.
The patient has a longstanding cardiovascular history: Status
post inferior MI in 1988 , CABG in 1999 with SVG to LAD , OM1 and
PDA , with subsequent PCI of SG to PDA in 10/5 in the setting of
a non-ST elevation MI that evolved into an ST elevation MI. The
patient was readmitted on 3/3/05 with decompensated congestive
heart failure. Since that time , the patient has required
increasing Lasix doses with worsening dyspnea on exertion ,
shortness of breath , a 30-pound increase in weight , worsening
three-pillow orthopnea , and increased lower extremity edema with
weeping sores. The patient presented to Scuc Valmo Medical Center
ED on 8/4/05 with blood pressure 196/97 , JVP to 16 cm ,
bilateral crackles , and right greater than left pleural effusion
on chest x-ray. BNP at the time of admission was 22 , 143 ( up from
19 , 189 on 4/25/05 ). The patient was transferred to the CCU for
nitro drip and Lasix drip. She was diuresed with a net output 2
liters on 8/4/05 .  The patient was then transferred to the
floor on a Lasix drip at 20 mg/hour plus Diuril 500 mg IV as
needed. Her nitroglycerin drip had been stopped on 7/8/05 in
the morning.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease: Inferior MI in 1988 , CABG in 1999 ,
and ST elevation MI in 10/5 , ( see HPI for details ).
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes greater than 20 years.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 1.4 to 2.4 ) ,
likely secondary to hypertension and diabetes , but concerned for
renal artery stenosis based on the history.
6. CVA in 1991 - cerebellar.
7. Status post a right CEA in 1981 , and left CEA , that is a
carotid endarterectomy , in 1999.
8. Peripheral vascular disease , status post aortofemoral bypass
in 1999.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Toprol 200 mg daily , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , hydralazine 25 mg
t.i.d. , Lipitor 80 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg
daily , Lasix 160 mg b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , PhosLo t.i.d. ,
and Lantus.
ALLERGIES:
ARBs cause hives.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
A 135-pack-year tobacco history. No alcohol or illicits. The
patient lives alone.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease ( mother in her 50's ).
IMAGING:
Chest x-ray on 8/4/05 showed a moderate right pleural effusion ,
cephalization and pulmonary edema. EKG showed Q waves in 2 , 3
and aVF with T-wave inversions ( old findings , no acute changes ).
Echo ( 6/25 ): EF 35% ( down from 55% in 1/5 ) , mild concentric
LVH , diffuse global hypokinesis with new akinesis of the
septal-inferior walls.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Pump - persistent volume overload , minimal response to
diuresis with 20 mg/hour Lasix drip. Attempted diuresis with
Diuril , Lasix IV , and finally nesiritide. Nesiritide
discontinued on 10/25/05 .  Torsemide was started on 10/25/05 with
improved diuresis. The patient has consistently refused
dialysis. Blood pressure was controlled during this
hospitalization with hydralazine , Isordil , and Lopressor. All
medications were stopped on 9/20/05 .  Ejection fraction 35%.
b. Ischemia - enzymes peaked on 10/5/05 with a CK of 152 , an MB
of 39.6 , and a troponin of 21.44. EKG at this time showed ST
depressions in V4 through V6. The recommendation of the
Cardiology team was that the patient undergo cardiac
catheterization. The patient refused any intervention with
cardiac catheterization due to concerns of further damage to her
kidneys. A decision was made to medically manage the patient.
She was briefly on heparin while this decision was concluded , and
heparin was stopped on 5/22/05 with enzymes trending down , and
no evidence of active ischemia.
c. Rhythm - the patient had bursts of normal sinus ventricular
tachycardia on telemetry. She was maintained on a low-dose
beta-blocker until 10/25/05 .  She has been in a normal sinus
rhythm from 10/5/05 through 9/20/05 . 
2. Pulmonary: The patient has an oxygen requirement of 2 liters
secondary to a right pleural effusion and congestive heart
failure. The patient's IV diuretics were stopped on 9/20/05 in
consideration of changing goals of care. If the patient becomes
short of breath in the absence of diuretics , we would recommend
morphine elixir 10 mg q.2 h. as needed for shortness of breath.
3. Renal: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency was likely
secondary to hypertension and diabetes. MRA on 10/5/05 to
evaluate for renal artery stenosis showed right renal artery
stenosis. The patient's creatinine increased to 4 on 10/25/05 ,
likely secondary to diuresis. Ultrasound was refused. The Renal
consult team was following , but the patient refused any dialysis.
4. Endo: The patient's diabetes was controlled with Lantus
insulin and an aspart insulin sliding scale. There was concern
for hypoglycemia on 9/20/05 in the setting with no oral intake.
All of the patient's diabetic medications have been stopped at
this time.
5. Psychiatry: The Psychiatry consult team was consulted for
major depressive disorder. There was concern for delirium.
Celexa was started for depression. Seroquel was tried p.r.n. for
insomnia and delirium , but it was stopped due to change in mental
status. The patient was able to make her own medical decisions
at the time of refusing cardiac catheterization. She understood
the risk of refusing cardiac catheterization. We will continue
no psychiatric medications at the time of discharge. May
consider Haldol for concern regarding worsening delirium.
6. The patient is currently DNR/DNI , comfort measures only. She
is being transferred to inpatient hospice at Gateho Health . 
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Include morphine elixir 10 mg p.o. q.2 h. as needed for shortness
of breath.
CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
Poor.
