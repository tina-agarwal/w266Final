Discharge Date: 5/19/2006
ATTENDING: CALVERY , BRADY M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure exacerbation ,
pneumonia.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED DURING THIS
ADMISSION: Bronchoalveolar cancer , atrial fibrillation ,
hypertension , hypothyroidism , mitral valve repair , and chronic
renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Sichel is a 75-year-old female
with past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease , congestive heart failure with an EF of 30% , mitral valve
repair in 7/26 , lung cancer likely stage IIIB , and atrial
fibrillation , who was recently discharged on 3/17/2006 after
being admitted for acute renal failure and chronic renal failure
and hyperkalemia. Since being discharged on 3/17/2006 , the
patient reported that she had been doing well until the date of
admission when she noticed a 2.5-pound weight gain , increased
shortness of breath with activity and increased oxygen
requirement during the day. She reports that she normally uses 2
liters of oxygen at night , however , she was needing the oxygen
during the day. She also reports 2 episodes of substernal chest
pain which occurred at rest. There was no radiation , no nausea ,
vomiting , or diaphoresis. These episodes of chest pain lasted 3
or 4 minutes and resolved with nitroglycerin sublingual. The
patient also noted that she had been urinating very much , does
report she had been taking all of her medications as directed at
discharge. She thus called her primary cardiologist , Dr.
Bottex , who instructed her to get labs drawn. She was found to
have potassium of 5.4 and a creatinine of 2.3 and thus was told
to report to the ED.

or vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , or rashes.

97.3 , pulse of 80 , blood pressure 146/76 , and respiratory rate of
16. O2 saturation of 96% on room air. HEENT: She had moist
mucous membranes. Her oropharynx was clear. She had a left
pupil which was enlarged and nonreactive secondary to that being
a surgical eye. Right eye was reactive. She had no
lymphadenopathy. Lungs: left side was clear to
auscultation. The right side had decreased breath sounds at the
base , few crackles at the right base. Cardiovascular
Examination: She had irregularly irregular rhythm. She had a
normal S1 , S2 , did not have any murmurs , rubs , or gallops and was
found to have a flat JVP on admission. Abdominal Examination:
She had positive bowel sounds , she was soft , nontender ,
nondistended. She did not have any hepatomegaly. Extremities:
She was warm and well perfused. Distal pulses were not palpable.
She did have trace edema , left greater than right which was
chronic. She was alert and oriented x3.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
Pulmonary/Oncology: The patient was admitted in stable condition
and was requiring 2 liters of oxygen to keep her saturations in
the mid 90s. She had a chest x-ray which showed a right pleural
effusion. Review of previous imaging done on 9/15/2006
demonstrated an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe ,
which was surrounded by a right pleural effusion of moderate
size. The patient also had a PET scan in early November , which
showed that the consolidation lit up extensively. Review of
these studies prompted consideration of possible pneumonia versus
a bronchioalveolar carcinoma spread. Pulmonary was consulted and
they suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possible
postobstructive pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin ,
vancomycin , and Flagyl on 1/4/2006. She received 7 days of
these antibiotics while in hospital. On day 4 of her
hospitalization , a thoracentesis was performed for both
diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. The pleural fluid
demonstrated a transudative picture. Gram stain was negative.
Cultures did not grow anything. Cytology , preliminary read was
negative. She had 50 white blood cells and 2000 red blood cells
approximately 800 mL were removed and the patient felt much less
short of breath following the thoracentesis requiring much less
oxygen. A followup CT scan was obtained , which showed continued
infiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural
effusion , no pneumothorax was observed. Radiology felt that her
consolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and that
it was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in fact
quite patent and thus it was decided that the patient would
continue a 14-day course of levofloxacin with followup with
pulmonary to consider whether or not a bronchoscopy would be
indicated for further workup of this patient's infiltrate with
followup imaging to occur as well.
Cardiovascularly , for this patient , ischemia wise , the patient
did have 2 episodes of chest pain prior to admission. She did
not have any EKG changes. Two sets of cardiac markers were
obtained which were both negative , thus assumed that she did not
have ischemic event that occurred. She was continued on her
aspirin and pravastatin while inhouse. Pump wise , the patient
has a diagnosis of CHF with an EF of 30%. She presented
approximately 2 kg above her dry weight. She was continued on
her home dose of torsemide 40 b.i.d. and also on the isosorbide
dinitrate although this was increased to 10 mg t.i.d. , she was
also started on hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. and did diurese
approximately 500 mL to 1 liter each day. She returned to her
dry weight and on the day of discharge , has a weight of 72.6 kg ,
had been admitted with a dry weight of 74.9 kg. Rhythm wise , the
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. She was rate
controlled with her metoprolol 37.5 mg daily. Her Coumadin was
continued except for brief period during which it was held prior
to the tap of this. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.
Endocrine wise , this patient's fingersticks were well controlled.
She was put on a course of Lantus and NovoLog q.a.c. sliding
scale as needed. Fingersticks were maintained within a normal
range. Her Levoxyl was 100 mcg daily , was continued and her
allopurinol 100 mg daily was continued for her history of gout.
On discharge , she is being put back on her glipizide for the
diabetes.
Fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition. The patient came in
hyperkalemic. She was given Kayexalate 30 mg x1 in the emergency
room to which she responded and had a normal potassium throughout
her hospital stay.
Renal. For this , the patient with her diuresis she did and with
the addition of the hydralazine , she did have her creatinine drop
from 2.2 down to 1.7 during her hospital admission on the day of
discharge , it was 1.9 , which is within her baseline for her
chronic renal insufficiency.
Hematology wise , the patient had a stable hematocrit in the low
30s. She was continued on her iron 325 twice a day for her iron
deficiency anemia. LENI's also performed and showed no evidence of DVT.
On the day of discharge , notable findings on physical exam , she
was afebrile. Heart rate was 71 to 85. Blood pressure 100-114
over 40-66. She was saturating 93% to 97% on room air.
Cardiovascular Examination: She was irregularly irregular. S1 ,
S2 were present. There were no murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Her
JVP was noted to be 9 cm. Examination of her lungs revealed that
they were clear to auscultation on the left. On the right , she
had crackles approximately halfway up , but did not have decreased
breath sounds as noted on admission. She did not have any
pitting edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , allopurinol 100 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg twice a day , ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice a
day , glipizide 5 mg twice a day , isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg 3
times a day , Levoxyl 100 mcg daily , Toprol XL 100 mg daily ,
Coumadin 1 mg q.p.m. , multivitamin 1 tablet daily , pravastatin 40
mg daily , torsemide 40 mg twice a day , Nexium 20 mg daily ,
levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth , q.48h. for a total course of 4 more
doses , hydralazine 10 mg 3 times a day , Ativan 0.5 mg as needed.
DISPOSITION: The patient was in stable condition.

from her thoracentesis is still pending.
