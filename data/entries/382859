sublingual nitroglycerin and 2/10 , 5 mg IV Lopressor made him pain
free. There was no resolution of his ST changes. He had
recurrence of chest pain two hours later in the emergency room.
Left-sided chest pressure was similar quality to the previous while
lying on the stretcher. His EKG showed flattened T wave changes in
V4-V6 , ST depression 1 mm V4-V6 , evolved he had a T wave inversion
in V3-V6 when pain free. He was started on heparin and IV
nitroglycerin.
