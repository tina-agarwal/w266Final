ATTENDING: GIUSEPPE C. MAROTTI M.D.
SERVICE: Cardiology.
ADMISSION INFORMATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease , status post remote IMI
( catheterization in 1989 with RCA occlusion ) , diabetes ,
hypercholesteremia , hypertension , admitted on 11/24/2005 for
chest pain. The patient experienced substernal chest pain
radiating to her left arm and shoulder while moving sofa. She

She was treated with 5 sublingual nitroglycerin tablets , aspirin ,
heparin , Lopressor , and morphine. She was subsequently taken to
the cardiac catheterization lab , then transferred to the CCU for
further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Anterolateral ST-elevation MI - On
11/24/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed 100% stenosis of the LAD , 60% stenosis of the left
circumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosis
of the RCA , with collateral flow from the LAD to the RCA. Her
LAD was stented. She was treated with Integrilin , aspirin ,
Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , and Lipitor. Her peak cardiac
markers were on 3/16/2005 and were as follows: CK 3344 , MB
386.4 , troponin I 191.4. Her EKG changes were slow to resolve.
Her admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm , first-degree A-V
block , and new right bundle-branch block. On 3/16/2005 , the
patient developed transient complete heart block. Gel pads were
placed , but the patient regained her native rhythm. A temporary
wire was placed. On 6/18/2005 , the temporary wire failed to
capture and was adjusted. On 9/18/2005 , the patient was taken
back to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea of
precluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block.
A stent was placed in the first marginal. On 4/21/2005 , early
in the morning , the patient aroused from bed ( despite bed-rest
precautions ). Her temporary wire was apparently dislodged. This
wire was then pulled. The patient developed chest pain without
EKG changes. She subsequently developed hypotension. There was
clinical evidence of tamponade including distant heart sounds and
cool extremities. The patient was taken emergently to the
cardiac catheterization lab. A stat echo performed in the
cardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusion
with diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle.
A pericardiocentesis was performed for 600 mL of bloody fluid.
It was thought that the temporary wire had perforated the right
ventricle and that the whole failed on its own. In the cardiac
catheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. A temporary
wire was replaced. On 7/5/2005 and 0/27/2005 , echocardiogram
showed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. The
patient's ejection fraction was preserved at 45 to 50%. There
was evidence of hypokinesis of the apical , inferoseptal , and
basal and mid inferior walls. On 0/27/2005 , the patient's
second temporary wire was pulled. The patient remained in her
native rhythm. She had rare runs of asymptomatic NSVT ranging
from 5 to 11 beats. She was without chest pain or shortness of
breath for the duration of her hospital stay. It was thought
that the patient did not require a permanent pacemaker or AICD
placement at the present time. The patient was discharged on
aspirin , Plavix , Toprol , lisinopril , and Lipitor. She had not
been on a statin previously. Her LFTs will require monitoring.
Notably , her fasting lipids included total cholesterol of 136 , an
HDL of 38 , an LDL of 98 , and triglycerides of 149.
2. PULMONARY: The patient required oxygen by nasal cannula
during her hospitalization. Status post pericardiocentesis , she
was weaned off oxygen. On the day of discharge , she was able to
ambulate on room air without desaturating.
3. ENDOCRINE: Diabetes mellitus. The patient was on oral
antihyperglycemics at home. In-house , she was treated standing
Lantus as well as Novolog standing and sliding scale q.a.c. She
was discharged on metformin. She has a normal creatinine
clearance.
4. HEME: Hematocrit. The patient's hematocrit dropped down
from the low 40s on admission to the low 30s on discharge. This
drop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematoma
status post 11/24/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequently
stabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 4/21/2005 ). There was a
desire to keep the patient's hematocrit above 30 given her acute
coronary syndrome; however , the patient refused for transfusion.
In the days prior to discharge , the patient's hematocrit
stabilized. If her hematocrit remains low , she might benefit
from outpatient anemia workup , including iron studies , B12 ,
folate , reticulocyte count , and smear.
5. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Urinary tract infection. The patient
developed a urinary tract infection. Urine culture on 3/16/2005
showed greater than 100 , 000 proteus. She was treated initially
with levofloxacin , then Bactrim. A urine culture from 7/5/2005
showed no growth.
6. POSTPROCEDURE PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was treated
transiently with Ancef status post temporary wire placement.
Blood cultures on admission were negative. Blood cultures were
not rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile without
signs of bacteremia.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Colace 100 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) 1 tab sublingual every
5 minutes x3 doses , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , Plavix 75 mg p.o.
daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Toprol XL 150 mg p.o. daily ,
metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed to take her
medications as directed , particularly the Plavix. The patient
was instructed to follow up with Dr. Vanbelle in clinic on
2/24/2005 and with Dr. Bradly Moerke at the Medwinds Hospital .  She was instructed to call her doctor and present
to the emergency room if she experienced any chest pain ,
shortness of breath , palpitations , fainting , or any other
symptoms concerning to her.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home with home
services.
