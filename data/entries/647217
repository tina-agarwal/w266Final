CHIEF COMPLAINT: CHEST PAIN , SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old woman with a
history of insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , HTN , IPF and some CAD who presents with the first episode
of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient first
experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest pressure and severe
shortness of breath five days prior to admission which resolved in
one hour but continued to have some substernal chest pain and
dyspnea on exertion with even mild exertion , i.e , crossing the
room. This occurred over the next several days. The patient
described the substernal chest pressure as being like hit in the
chest and this lasted about fifteen minutes. The patient did have
some nausea and vomiting associated with her symptoms and was most
comfortable sitting up. The patient did continue to have increased
shortness of breath at rest and worsened dyspnea on exertion with
around two episodes per day of severe chest pressure/dyspnea/pain
that required her to remain still over the next five days. She
also noted diaphoresis with all those episodes. She denied any
fever , chills , URI symptoms , cough , change in bowel movements. The
patient did complain of some bilateral foot edema 1-2 weeks prior
to admission. The patient has had stable two-pillow orthopnea and
notes no weight gain or loss , but notes decreased exercise
tolerance over the past month. The patient presented to her
primary care physician today secondary to continued shortness of
breath and was sent to the emergency department where
electrocardiogram revealed some ST depressions anterolaterally with
a troponin leak with a troponin level of 0.19 and was thus admitted
to the cardiology Memp Mont service.

HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 65-year-old female with a history of
coronary artery disease , hypertension , diabetes ,
IPF who presented with five days of chest pain/SOB beginning with
sudden onset five days prior to admission and had EKG changes
consistent with a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction anterolaterally.
Of note her troponin was 0.19. The differential diagnosis included
unstable angina and PE with worsening IPF superimposed on heart
disease. From a cardiovascular standpoint the patient has known
coronary artery disease with EKG changes which is likely status
post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a question of continued
unstable angina. The patient was initially put on aspirin ,
Lopressor 37.5 t.i.d. , heparin , oxygen and hooked up to a cardiac
monitor and EKG q.d. and was ruled out for enzymes. The patient
underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed LAD ostial 90% ,
proximal 80% , diag ostial 90% , left circ 90% , 80% lesions , marginal
1 , TUB 90% , RCA 50%. The patient underwent PTCA and stent x 2 with
good results. The patient remained chest pain free and had no
chest pain on exertion , i.e. , with ambulation. The echo showed
preserved left ventricular function with a good ejection fraction.
The ejection fraction was found to be 55%. There was no discrete
evidence of wall motion abnormality although the inferior and
posterior segments were not well visualized. There was left
ventricular hypertrophy. There was stromal mild right ventricular
hypertrophy and overall right heart function appeared to be
preserved. There was trivial to 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with
right heart pressures within normal limits. There was thickened
aortic leaflets with trivial central insufficiency and no evidence
of any outflow tract obstruction. There was similar mild mitral
regurgitation with the elliptic ring , the left atrial size was
slightly increased and there was no evidence of any effusion. From
a pulmonary standpoint the patient had LENIs which were negative
for a deep venous thrombosis. PFCs revealed a restrictive
physiology and poor diffusion consistent with IPF. The FEV1 was
69% predicted , TLC was 63% predicted , with a DLCO of 56% predicted.
The patient did have a retrocardiac infiltrate on chest x-ray and
the patient was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. for fourteen
days. From a GI perspective the patient had a history of colonic
polyps but tolerated the aspirin and was put on Nexium prophylaxis.
The patient was hypokalemic on 10/23 with a curious whitening on
EKG and peak T waves. The patient was treated with insulin , given
calcium and treated with Kayexalate x 3 and the hypokalemia quickly
resolved. The origin of the hypokalemia was unclear. The patient
did have an elevated potassium with a low bicarb which was
consistent with a type 4 RTA and also had hypoglycemia which was
then treated with prednisone overnight for IV contrast dye allergy.
The patient was also on Captopril which was discontinued secondary
to her renal issues.
