DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR/POSTERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 67 year old woman with a
history of atrial tachyarrhythmias but
no history of coronary artery disease. She came in with an
inferior/posterior myocardial infarction and was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit after initiation of TPA. Her cardiac risk
factors included tobacco , a question of hypercholesterolemia ,
negative for diabetes , hypertension , and family history. The
patient was a generally healthy female who smoked and had a history
of palpitations and atrial tachyarrhythmia as well as a junctional
rhythm and AIVR but no prior symptoms of coronary artery disease.
She had been followed by Dr. Ulven for complaints of dizziness
with palpitations and a work-up including a 24-hour Holter in 0/28
with frequent atrial premature beats , short bursts of
supraventricular tachycardia with occasional periods of junctional
tachyarrhythmia , and AIVR which correlated with the symptoms. An
echo in 0/28 showed a normal LVF with minimal mitral regurgitation
and systolic bowing. On exercise tolerance test at the time , she
went seven minutes stopping with symptoms of fatigue. Her maximal
heart rate was 76% and she had 1 mm ST elevations consistent with
but not diagnostic of ischemia. She was then managed on Procan
alone with good result for her arrhythmia. She was previously on
digoxin but no longer on it. She was active at baseline able to
walk two miles a day without chest pain , dyspnea on exertion ,
orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , ankle edema , claudication
symptoms , or other symptoms of cerebrovascular disease. The
morning of February , 1995 , she was in her usual state of health.
She awoke at 11 p.m. on 4/17/95 with 5/10 substernal chest pain ,
no shortness of breath , palpitations , diaphoresis , or light
headedness , and no prior similar events. She became nauseated and
diaphoretic without radiation to the arms or back and no pleuritic
or positional changes. They called the EMT and her blood pressure
was 116/62 , heart rate of 50 with her chest pain , she had NGT spray
times two en route , and in the Emergency Ward , she complained of
substernal chest pain with her vital signs unchanged. There was no
evidence of congestive heart failure. Her EKG showed 0.5 to 1 mm
ST elevations in II , III , aVF , and V6. There was no recent surgery
and no history of bleeds or cerebrovascular accident. TPA was
initiated within less than thirty minutes following arrival. She
was put on intravenous nitroglycerin , Heparin , morphine , and
aspirin. She had a resolution of her pain within 45 minutes
following the TPA with return to baseline of her ST segments. She
was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further care.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Atrial tachyarrhythmias ,
hypothyroidism , and status post
spinal fusion in 5/12 . 
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission included Synthroid 0.125 mg and
Procan SR 500 mg q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She had a twenty pack year history of smoking ,
currently smoking half a pack a day , and no
alcohol. She lived with her husband and her brother.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her father died at 94 from cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature was 97.5 , blood pressure 91/48 ,
heart rate of 48 , O2 saturation 99% on three
liters , and weight 115 pounds. She was alert , oriented , and
responsive. NECK: Supple , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugular
venous pressure was 5 cm. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: She had a
non-displaced point of maximal intensity , regular rate and rhythm ,
and normal S1 and S2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. ABDOMEN:
Soft , non-tender , and non-distended. RECTAL: Guaiac negative in
the Emergency Ward. EXTREMITIES: Negative for cyanosis and edema
and 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. NEUROLOGICAL:
Non-contributory.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her sodium was 141 , potassium of 4.5 ,
creatinine of 0.7 , her LDH was 290 , her
first CPK was 53 , cholesterol was 222 , PA was less than assay , her
NAPA was 1.0 , chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart
failure or cardiomegaly , and her EKG in the Coronary Care Unit was
normal sinus with 0.15/0.08/0.2 , 0.5 mm ST elevations in F , and no
Q or flipped T waves.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit ,
put on aspirin q.d. , and kept on Heparin. We
held off on a beta blockade given her heart rate which was often
less than 50 with a systolic blood pressure of 80 to 90. Her
intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned off and she was given some
fluid boluses secondary to the low blood pressure. We started her
on simvastatin for her cholesterol and discussed smoking cessation.
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction. Her peak CK was 789 with
an MB fraction of 79.2 and her troponin was 20. Over the course of
several days , her CPK drifted down to 695 to 604 with MB fraction
of 46.9%. Heparin was discontinued on 0/21/96 and the patient , on
6/28/96 , had been encouraged to get up and walk around. She did
so without any evidence of chest pain , she had no recurrence of
chest pain after this point , and on 0/21/96 , the Heparin was
discontinued and she continued to be pain free with ambulation. On
the morning of 11/23/96 , she had an exercise tolerance test , a
modified Bruce , which was positive. She went seven minutes and
twenty seconds stopping due to chest pain. There was no change in
her blood pressure , her maximal heart rate was 89 , and the EKG
showed 2 mm ST downsloping depressions in V4 and V5 that developed
with exercise and persisted into recovery which was highly
predictive of coronary artery disease. She came back up to the
floor and we discussed doing a catheterization with her. At the
time , we kept her NPO. An hour later , she developed 8/10 chest
pain that was relieved with one sublingual and she was pain free
before the EKG could be done , however , thirty minutes after that ,
she again developed 8/10 chest pain. An EKG showed 2-3 mm ST
elevations in V4 through V6 with pseudonormalization of T waves in
II , III , aVF , and V3 through V6. Her pain decreased to 6/10 , she
had been restarted on Heparin , and put on intravenous nitroglycerin
with her blood pressure tolerating it. She was given six
sublinguals and 8 mg of morphine without relief of pain , heart rate
was 60 , and blood pressure was 100/60. She was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory. The catheterization showed right
atrial pressure of 1 , right ventricle 24/4 , pulmonary capillary
wedge of 8 , arterial 110/70 , she had a 50% stenosis in her left
anterior descending , and a subtotal occlusion of her left
circumflex which was opened with PTCA to 20%. She was kept on
Heparin for another 24 hours following the PTCA and then the
Heparin was discontinued. She remained pain free after her cardiac
catheterization/PTCA and was discharged home on 5/28/96 with
follow-up with Dr. Rumphol . Her TSH level was checked given her
history of hypothyroidism and her TSH was 1.0.
DISPOSITION: Patient's hospital course was without complication.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin , ECASA , 325 mg q.d. , Synthroid 125
micrograms q.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150
sublingually one tablet q.5 minutes times three , and simvastatin 20
mg q.h.s.
FOLLOW-UP: Patient is to follow-up with Dr. Stikeleather in two to
three weeks.
