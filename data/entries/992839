Discharge Date: 2/29/2005
ATTENDING: MACCARONE , HERB M.D.
SERVICE: General Medical Service , Na
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , aortic valve and
mitral valve dysfunction.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is 59-year-old female who is
status post mitral valve repair , aortic valve repair , history of
endocarditis , history of rheumatic heart disease , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus , and congestive heart failure who presents with
increasing shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal
pain. She has been under significant stress at home since last
summer and notes slowly declining health since that time. She
has had increasing shortness of breath as well as dyspnea on
exertion since July 2004 and has gotten worse in the past one
month , and even significantly worse in the past week. The
patient notes increasing lower extremity edema on the right side
greater than the left. She states that this is her baseline with
the right side being more than the left. She has no increase in
her abdominal girth , the patient has two-to three-pillow
orthopnea ( from one-pillow orthopnea , one month ago ) , she does
have some paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , she has no increased
nocturia. The patient notes that the shortness of breath is "not
angina; I do not have that." She does not have any
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , or radiation of pain. The patient
says that she does not check her weigh at home , but "knows" she
is in failure when she is short of breath. She also notes
nausea , vomiting , and some abdominal pain stating that it started
about a week and a half ago. She had gone to see the ED on the
Sunday prior to admission where the patient reportedly had a
benign exam , low-grade temperature , given recent Levaquin for an
upper respiratory tract infection , she was then started on Flagyl
for a possible C. difficile infection. The patient's diarrhea
stopped , but she had still remained some abdominal pain and
increased cough , which was nonproductive. She went to her PCP on
the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath and was
sent to the ED for diuresis. In the ED , she was given 60 mg of
IV Lasix with good output per report. She did have some decrease
in her shortness of breath shortly thereafter. She also
complained of 10/10 abdominal pain and was given some Dilaudid.
On the floor during the interview , she did have some projectile
vomiting. She was able to pass gas. She reported no fevers ,
chills , or night sweats. She reported no bright red blood per
rectum. She reported no change in her bowel , bladder , or urinary
habits.

normal access. There were some nonspecific T-wave inversions.
CHEST X-RAY: Showed mild vascular congestion. There was no
evidence of any effusion.
IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old female with a rheumatic heart
disease , status post St. Jude's MVR and AVR , congestive heart
failure who presents with mild volume overload and abdominal pain
with nausea and vomiting.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: When the patient was admitted , she was ruled out
for an MI. She did have a slight increase of her troponins ,
which were attributed to mild demand ischemia. In addition , she
had some slight anemia , which could also be contributed to the
demand as well in addition to the clear volume overload. She did
fine from the standpoint , had no ST changes on any of her EKGs.
The patient laid her head workup for future AVR and MVR with the
Surgical Service , with Dr. Bio . Her workup was extensive and
included a cardiac catheterization , which showed no significant
coronary artery disease. The hemodynamics were notable for the
following: RA of 12 , PA of 92/23/44 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 22 with V waves to 42. The mitral valve was grossly
normal with appropriate leaflet motion. The AV was also grossly.
The overall conclusion was elevated right-sided heart pressures.
She had no evidence of major atherosclerotic disease of the
coronary arteries.
b. Pump: Please see cath report as above. The patient was
admitted and diuresed with IV Lasix , so she came down to a
euvolemic state. Her diuresis was continued with 80 mg IV Lasix
on a b.i.d. basis. She was diuresed until there was a subsequent
bump in her creatinine to 1.8 , 1.9. After that point , diuresis
was slowly modified. She was then placed back on a regimen of
120 mg of p.o. Lasix q.o.d. That is the dosing of Lasix on which
she is discharged.
c. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation that has been rate controlled with a beta-blocker.
On admission , her digoxin was stopped. She was evaluated by the
EP Service. They recommended epicardial lead placement at
surgery due to her tachybrady syndrome. The patient was
discharged on diltiazem 30 mg q.i.d. She will have her
medications modified status post her valvular repair in the very
near future.
d. Presurgical workup: In addition to echo , right and left
heart cath , the patient had a TEE performed. TEE showed normal
left atrial appendage without evidence of localized thrombus.
St. Jude's valve was well seated in the aortic position. There
was no significant aortic regurg that was noted. A St. Jude's
valve was well seated in the mitral position as well. There was
trace mild regurgitation noted. There was slight asynchronous
motion of the prosthetic valve apparatus that was noted. The
tricuspid valve was normal in appearance. There was mild
regurgitation present. Visualized portion of the thoracic aorta
revealed minimal atheromatous plaque.
2. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from her pulmonary
standpoint. She continued to sat well on room air. She did not
required any nebulizers during her stay.
3. GI: The patient was initially admitted with some abdominal
pain and also nausea and vomiting. She had a KUB performed for a
question of potential bowel obstruction. A single frontal view
of the abdomen was obtained and is reported in the final
radiology report. There was gas seen within the loops of small
bowel as well as the colon. There is no bowel dilatation seen.
The overall impression was no evidence of any high-grade bowel
obstruction. It is likely that some of her pain was secondary to
hepatic congestion. The nausea and vomiting eventually resolved
and perhaps this is some type of viral illness or
gastroenteritis. She did have some episode of diarrhea prior to
admission along with some abdominal cramping. The patient was
continued on her PPI for GERD prophylaxis. At one point , she
required increasing her dosage of Nexium secondary to GERD-like
symptoms. It seemed that increasing the amount of Nexium she
received , precipitated some diarrhea. She was returned to a
normal dosing of Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. while in-house. She was
discharged on omeprazole 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , which she will
continue to take as an outpatient. In addition , she was given
prescription for Colace and also Senokot today. She should
continue using.
4. Heme: Her hematocrit remained relatively stable during her
stay with averaging of 26 to 27 as far as her hematocrit. We
were not concerned with keeping her hematocrit 30 or above at all
times given her clean coronary arteries seen from the left and
also right heart catheterization. She did have a slight dip in
her hematocrit at one point requiring two units of packed red
blood cells. Her hematocrit bumped appropriately to 30 or 31.
She required no subsequent transfusions thereafter. With regard
to anticoagulation , she was placed on the heparin drip at 950
units per hour to maintain a PTT between 60 and 80 secondary to
her mechanical valves that are in place. On discharge , the
patient was transitioned to Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. with a renal
dosing. She will continue to take this Lovenox as an outpatient
and stop it one to two days prior to her surgery as instructed.
She has home VNA in place.
5. Renal: Her BUN and creatinine was relatively stable on
admission. It did elevate to as high as 3.3 , 3.4 on her
admission secondary to her ongoing diuresis. When diuresis was
held for several days given her markedly increased urine output
and as she became more hydrated and euvolemic , her creatinine
returned to its baseline of 1.2 , 1.3. She has no active issues
now.
6. Endocrine: We appreciated the Diabetes Service for following
her very closely while in-house. Several modifications were made
to her regimen while here to get good control of her blood
glucose. She was maintained on a stable regimen of NPH 60 units
in the morning , NPH 30 units in the evening. She also was placed
on a sliding scale. She also received NovoLog of 15 units in the
morning with breakfast and also 15 at dinner. She was not
receiving any of the NovoLog while at lunch. She will continue
to take this regimen in home. All of her prescriptions were
provided by Carl Mcclenahan , who is following with the Diabetes
Service. They will become again involved with her care as she
plans for surgery in the very near future.
7. Infectious disease: The patient was stable from an ID
standpoint during her entire admission. On July , 2005 , the
patient was noted to have an increase in her white blood cell
count upwards towards the 20 , 000. This was one day prior to a
planned surgery on May , 2005 with Dr. Villata to repair her
aortic valve and also her mitral valve. The surgery was delayed
as a result of this , so an infectious workup could ensue. She
had a urine sent that showed , the suggestion of a urinary tract
infection. Levaquin was given for treatment of her UTI.
Surveillance cultures were drawn daily. Given the fact that she
had a right groin hematoma that performed after the heart
catheterization we questioned whether or not this could be some
type of infectious source. She had the hematoma aspirated , it
was negative for any organisms. She had no other identified
places as far as source of infection. It was believed that she
could potential have endocarditis as she has had in the past.
One of her cultures actually grew out a species of Abiotrophia.
There is only one culture positive , that was taken on February . 
She has had no subsequent cultures growing out at the time of
this dictation. We appreciate the Infectious Disease Team
following. Their recommendations were to hold antibiotics unless
subsequent cultures began to grow out. Their recommendations
were to continue to follow all cultures and to perform a TEE. A
repeat TEE was performed and showed no evidence of any lesions or
change in bowel function. There were clearly no vegetation seen
on either any transthoracic echos or TEEs. ID made
recommendations as far as perioperative antibiotics , which would
include two weeks of ceftriaxone 1 g IV b.i.d. under the
assumption that this would be completing a course of her therapy
after SBE. They would also recommend sending all valve tissue
for Gram stain and culture as well as pathology. If the Gram
stain and culture were positive , they would suggest extending the
course of the above-mentioned antibiotic therapy.
8. Neurologic: The patient was given Darvon and also codeine as
needed for her pain. She complained of right groin pain
secondary to the hematoma. Her pain is much improved that she is
able to ambulate easily around the Tl Brown Vo on discharge. The
hematoma is resolving and her pain is resolving as well.
9. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient is
tolerating p.o. well. Her electrolytes were repleted as needed
daily.
10. Psychologic: The patient was seen by social work. It is
clear that she has many anxieties about the surgery and also in
going home and returning to her social environment. She
necessitated volume prior to many procedures given her severe
anxiety.
11. Disposition: The patient is stable from a medical
standpoint with all cultures clear and no evidence of active
infection. Her white blood cell count is now normal. She is now
awaiting surgical repair of her valve and will have a surgery
scheduled with Dr. Berreth office in the next one to two weeks.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
1. The patient was given instructions to call Dr. Mccutchan
office to coordinate her appointment for her valve repair in the
next one to two weeks pending her surgeon's return.
2. The patient instructed to call Dr. Doug Schlanger on March ,
2005 , to discuss surgical plans and also to follow up.
3. The patient should have all her blood cultures followed up
prior to her surgery. If any of her blood cultures become
positive in the interim , we will begin a long course of
antibiotic therapy and delay surgery at the discussion of the
Cardiovascular Service.
