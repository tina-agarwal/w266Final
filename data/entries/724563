HOSPITAL COURSE:
This 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including
morbid obesity , diabetes , CHF with diastolic dysfunction , and
chronic renal insufficiency secondary to diabetes is on home
nesiritide infusions and comes in with total body volume
overload. She was aggressively diuresed during this
hospitalization.
COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular:
1. Ischemia: The patient did not have any positive cardiac
enzymes and no evidence of ischemia. She was maintained on
aspirin , a beta-blocker , and a statin.
2. Pump: The patient was diuresed aggressively. She was
started on a continuous BNP drip along with Lasix 160 mg IV
b.i.d. plus metolazone as needed to help diurese approximately 1
liter per day. The patient did not respond to p.o. Lasix. The
patient was variably responsive to diuretics , but at the time of
discharge , had diuresed down the 130.3 kg a drop of approximately
10 kg or approximately 22 pounds. The patient's BNP at the time
of discharge was 8 and she was not felt to be in heart failure.
She continued to have lower extremity edema that was felt likely
secondary to venous stasis and lack of mobilization. Therefore ,
she was encouraged to mobilize and given compression stockings to
help mobilize the fluid in her legs. At the time of discharge ,
she was diuresing well to oral Bumex and she was maintained on
Bumex in order to keep her ins and outs even each days.
3. Rhythm: The patient did not have issues from a rhythm
perspective.
Renal: The patient had a creatinine that climbed as high as 5.8 ,
during her hospitalization. She was felt to have an underlying
diabetic nephropathy. The Renal Service ( Dr. Courtney Sissom ) was
consulted and felt that the patient would likely eventually need
outpatient dialysis , however , there was no emergent indication
for dialysis at this time. The patient has seen Dr. Hilton V Sheaks , at Fullfirst , Vascular Surgery prior to
this for consideration of a fistula placement and she will
continue to follow up with Dr. Sauberan following discharge.
Hematology: The patient was maintained on Coumadin for her
history of a clot in the right and left superficial femoral vein ,
which was diagnosed in 3/24 and was noted to be extending
towards the deep venous system. The patient was also continued
on iron for her underlying anemia.
Endocrine: The patient had diabetes and was maintained on her
NPH plus a regular insulin sliding scale to control her blood
sugars and her blood sugars were reasonably well controlled and
generally below 200.
Musculoskeletal: The patient was complaining of increasing
cramps in her calves a few days prior to discharge. Therefore ,
lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound tests were repeated and
these ruled out recurrent deep venous thrombosis. A CK was
checked and this was normal and therefore , it was felt that the
patient did not have any evidence of rhabdomyolysis or a
compartment syndrome. It was felt that these pains were most
likely secondary to venous pooling in the legs combined with
inactivity. The patient was treated symptomatically with
oxycodone and encouraged to ambulate to help mobilize the fluid
out of her legs.
FINAL MEDICATIONS:
The final medications will be dictated at the time of discharge.
