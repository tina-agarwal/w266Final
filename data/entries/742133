LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
On 8/28/05 , sodium 136 , K of 4.1 , chloride of 101 , CO2 of 30 ,
BUN of 28 , creatinine of 1.3 , glucose of 286 , and magnesium of
1.9. Hematology from the same day , white count of 12 , hematocrit
of 38 , hemoglobin of 12.9 , platelets 263 , 000 , PT of 13.4 , INR
1.0 , PTT of 29.5 , and A1c of 7.5. Cardiac catheterization was

circulation with inferior hypokinesis. The ventriculogram showed
an EF of 45%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was transferred from the outside hospital status post
cath for surgical revascularization. The patient had an EKG on
8/28/05 , which showed first-degree AV block with a rate of 61
and ST depressions in leads I , II , and aVL. Chest x-ray showed a
calcific aortic knob , otherwise clear. The patient was evaluated
for conduit for her surgery and underwent venous mapping and
found to have some vein in her left leg , and on 4/24/05 , the
patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a coronary
artery bypass grafting x3 , a LIMA to the LAD , and a sequential
vein graft to the ramus and to the obtuse marginal three. On the

neuropathy. The patient also was restarted back on her
Wellbutrin for her depression.
Cardiovascular: The patient initially was in a sinus bradycardia
with a backup pacing wire , temporary pacing wire , and started on
low-dose beta-blockers; however , the patient had no further
bradycardia and her Lopressor was titrated up for discharge dose
of Toprol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and captopril for hypertension and
the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout her
postoperative course.

for GI prophylaxis while she is on the aspirin and Plavix status
post cardiac surgery instant.
ID: The patient was on vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis , but
had no other infectious issues postoperatively and will not be
discharged on any antibiotics. By postoperative day #8 , the
