heparin 500 an hour , hemodynamically stable. Transferred to
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #2.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: No neurologic deficit. Pain well controlled.
Cardiovascular: Cardiac meds , aspirin , and Lopressor continuing

Respiratory: Weaning O2 as tolerated , chest PT ambulation as
tolerated , continuing DuoNeb , had been extubated on postop day
#1.
GI advancing diet as tolerated. GI prophylaxis.
Renal: Maintain adequate urine output , monitor BMP , and replace
electrolytes p.r.n. Diuresis as tolerated when stable , has
underlying renal insufficiency for ??___?? with diuretics.
Endocrine: Tight glycemic control.
Hematology: Anticoagulated with aspirin monitoring H&amp;H
transfusing p.r.n. keeping on heparin drip at 500 units an hour
without titration. Giving Coumadin 5 mg night of transfer and
then checking PT/INR.
ID: No antibiotics. The patient stable for transferred to
Step-Down Unit While in the Step-Down Unit , he proceeded to
progress well. Postop day #3 , Keeping heparin at 500 units an
hour , INR 1.5 , wires cut chest tubes out , the patient ambulating.
Postop day #4 , ??___?? 90s on 2-4 liters , increased heparin 600
units an hour , PTT 57.1 , INR 1.8 , creatinine up to 1.6. Good
urine output. Ambulating independently. Postop day #5 , the
patient now one or for left lower extremity fascial biopsy to
rule out necrotizing fasciitis.
General Surgery , ID and derm involved continuing to give
vancomycin. Creatinine increased to 1.7 from baseline of 1.4 ,
BUN of 70 , came down on Lasix and Diuril ??___??4 units FFP prior
to going to OR. The patient still very volume overloaded cards
following. Positive UTI with greater than 1000 gram-negative
rods , started Cipro. Postop day #6 , sinus rhythm. Heart rate
elevated at high 90s. Increase Lopressor 75 mg q.i.d. , BP stable
remains on two liters O2 , continuing to aggressively diuresed.
Biopsy from yesterday stripped or to rule necrotizing fasciitis
shows only neutrophils on past sampled per report , nonspecific
per general surgery/I discontinued Flagyl. The patient remains
on levofloxacin for UTI and vancomycin for gram-positive
coverage. Anticipate treating with vancomycin while inpatient
than discharge , the patient had short course of levofloxacin to
cover both UTI and cellulitic dermatitis. Dermatology feels
delay on left lower extremity , likely secondary to edema and
nephrotic history , punctured left dorsal blister for pressure
release since sterile culture for culture and sensitivity , wound
graft with Xeroform and Kerlix. Heparin/Coumadin bridge for St.
Jude AVR , PTT slightly low this a.m. increase heparin 600 to 650.
??___?? negative , platelets 282. Postop day #7 , sinus rhythm ,
hemodynamically stable , remains on 2.5 liters of O2 which tends
2+ bilateral lower extremity and penile/scrotal edema.
Creatinine rising currently 1.8 on Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.
Discontinue Diuril , today given low sodium , renal following today
has no pending. ??___?? vancomycin/levofloxacin for left lower
extremity cellulitis and UTI coverage. Anticipate treating
cellulitis with vancomycin while inpatient and discharging on
short course of levofloxacin to cover both UTI and cellulitis ,
has two new blisters on left foot , ankle , and toe dressing with
Xeroform and DSD. All blisters postop thought to be secondary to
edema and history of nephrotic syndrome. ID/derm/general surgery
have signed off. Heparin/Coumadin bridge for St. Jude AVR.
Hematocrit improving slowly with diuresis , no prbc's , ??___??
negative. Postop day #8 , sinus rhythm , BP stable now on room
air , remains very volume overloaded tense bilateral edema at
lower extremity in addition to penile/scrotal edema. Foley
remains in place due to significant penile edema , diuresing well
on Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , creatinine stable 1.8 renal following.
Sodium slightly improved on Diuril , remains on
vancomycin/levofloxacin for left lower extremity cellulitis and
UTI coverage. Anticipate treating cellulitis with vancomycin
while inpatient , and then discharged in a short course of
levofloxacin. Dressing blisters on left lower extremity with
Xeroform and DSD. Heparin discontinue today with INR of 2.3.
Postop day #9 , in sinus rhythm , BP stable , ambulating well on
room air. Hematocrit down to 24.6 despite diuresis giving 1 unit
packed red blood cells , remains very volume overloaded.
Creatinine down plateau 1.8-1.7 on Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. with
negative fluid balance daily. Lower extremities with improved
edema , although still 1 to 2 plus , also still has significant
penile/scrotal edema with full remaining in place. Renal has
been following , but no recent note. Cards also following. INR
therapeutic for ST. Jude AVR of heparin , holding Coumadin tonight
for INR upto 3.7. Postop day #10 , creatinine down with 1.6 ,
hematocrit 28.7 , left leg with multiple healing blisters , dusky
areas onto toes on left foot , good peripheral pulses , continue
antibiotics. Postop day #11 continuing antibiotics. Wounds on
left leg appear clean and dry without erythema afebrile. White
count 10.6 , creatinine only 1.6. Plan home on antibiotics one to
two days. Postop day #12 left dorsal foot blister without
erythema. Left medial foot blister broke this afternoon , clear
drainage , no erythema , getting Xeroform dressing to dorsal foot ,
skin starting to get macerated. Anterior left lower leg
cellulitis with increased erythema from vein harvest site
reevaluating. INR 1.8 and not holding Coumadin , kept Lasix at
b.i.d. added Zaroxolyn 800 mL negative so far , penile edema
slightly improved , albumin 2.2 , gave IV albumin and started high
protein ??___?? t.i.d. Spoke with general surgery again
discontinued left thigh sutures on Thursday. Left leg with
increasing edema , ??___?? not done ambulating home when ready.
Postop day #13 , sinus rhythm/room air showing slow improvement ,
increase Zaroxolyn b.i.d. to improve diuresis. Cold renal to
revisit the patient , they will see him , but agree with the
current treatment. Ordered 24 hour urine protein and creatinine.
??___?? negative for lower extremity DVT , although exam was
limited by edema. The patient ambulating well on volts.
Excellent nursing care with dressing changes of lower extremity
wounds and blisters. On 10/30/06 , sinus rhythm/room air , stopped
IV antibiotics as they were making little difference in wound
healing. ID reconsulted for right lower leg cellulitis and
further management. Dermatology called back for results of skin
biopsy. Sub-epidural fasciculation with abundant eosinophils
versus possible bullous pemphigoid. The patient ambulating
frequently and continuing to diurese. Postop day #15 , sinus
rhythm/room air continues to diurese. ID running fever and
erythema around ??___?? "stab and grab" site is that patient
??___?? allergic reaction to Ethibond ties and bands. We will
try Benadryl to see if this helps revolve symptoms. The
patient's erythema in legs is dependent , looked much better
today , legs elevated and ??____?? with ambulation. Lower
extremity and penile edema improving daily. Blisters on feet
continue to receive excellent care from nursing. Derm cyst
bullous pemphigoid very unlikely because of distribution of
blisters likely from extreme edema/inflammation per renal , start
ACE inhibitor when patient back to dry weight , beginning
discontinue planning. Postop day 16 , PT screening erythema/SVG
site erythema the same ambulating with assistance diuresing still
up 7 kilos by weight. Postop day #17 , 24-hour urine protein
pending , left leg SVG sites slowly improving of antibiotics ,
ambulating with assistance , sinus rhythm with/room air , stable ,
continuing diuresis. The patient was evaluated by Cardiac
Surgery Service to be stable to discharge to home with VNA
