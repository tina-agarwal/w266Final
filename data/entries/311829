ATTENDING: SATERFIELD , JAYSON D.
MEDICAL SERVICE:
Milbrown Ae A
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
Acute renal failure , anemia.
LIST OF PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , family history of CAD , degenerative joint disease ,
depression , obstructive sleep apnea , pulmonary hypertension and
morbid obesity.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 60-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of
hypertension , obstructive sleep apnea , degenerative joint
disease , and recent falls , now in rehab since 2/10 , most
recently at Stusem Memorial Hospital , who presented with acute renal failure
found on routine labs , the morning of admission. The creatinine
was 3.6 on admission up from 1 in 5/13 and up from 2.2 in 7/24
BUN was elevated at 96. Labs were also notable for hematocrit
of 24 down from a baseline of 44 in 2001. The patient reports
being told that she had chronic kidney disease during an
admission to SITMH in 2/10 , attributed to heavy NSAID use in the
setting of degenerative joint disease. The patient stopped using
NSAIDs in 7/24 Prior to July , she reports decreased p.o. intake
in the setting of feeling like she was retaining fluid. Today ,
she complains of diffuse swelling and increased shortness of
breath x2-3 weeks. Denies chest pain , orthopnea or PND. Also ,
reports dysuria in the setting of indwelling Foley since 7/24
Denies fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , no melena
or bright red blood per rectum in the last six months but reports
melena and bright red blood per rectum intermittently in 2003 in
the setting of colonoscopy that was positive for diverticula.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
The patient was afebrile with a heart rate ranging from 60-90 ,
systolic blood pressure of 120-140 , respiratory rate of 18 , she
was satting 95% on 2-4 liters. The patient was obese nonmobile ,
alert and oriented x3 and in no apparent distress. Pupils were
equal round and reactive to light. Sclerae were anicteric. She
had no conjunctival pallor. JVP could not be assessed due to
body habitus. She had a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and
S2. She had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur audible at the left
upper sternal border. Lungs were notable for crackles at the
left base on anterior lung exam , they were otherwise clear. Her
abdomen was obese , she had positive bowel sound. It was soft ,
nondistended and nontender. Extremities were warm and well
perfused. She had 2+ pitting edema to the knee bilaterally.
Pertinent lab results as mentioned in the HPI.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES DURING THE ADMISSION:
1/29/05 creation of left arm AV fistula; 11/20/05 EGD.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
In summary , this is a 60-year-old morbidly obese woman who
presented with acute and chronic renal failure and anemia.
PROBLEM:
1. Renal: Renal failure initially thought to be secondary to
prerenal etiology in the setting of elevated BUN/creatinine ratio
and FENA less than 1% in the setting of Lasix and FEBUN of 19%
and because of the presence of abundant granular casts. ATN also
possibility but urine sodium was 29. Postrenal etiology was
ruled out with a renal ultrasound without evidence of
hydronephrosis. The patient was aggressively hydrated once
outside hospital records confirmed an ejection fraction of 60%.
However , the patient initially appeared to fail volume challenge
with no acute change in creatinine past 3.2 from 2/16/05 to
7/26/05. At that time , Vascular Surgery was consulted for AV
fistula placement in the setting of GFR of approximately 17 that
was not improving. AV fistula was placed on 1/29/05 in the left
arm without complication. Renal function was waxing and waning
throughout hospital course with creatinine at time of discharge
of 3.1. Daily urine output usually approximately 600-700 mL.
All diuretics and ACE inhibitor was held throughout hospital
course and blood pressure well controlled. The patient should
not be restarted on these medications because it will precipitate
worsening kidney failure.
2. GI: Colonoscopy in 2001/2003 notable for diverticula. Stool
was guaiac throughout hospital course and generally guaiac
positive brown stool. Hematocrit did not bump appropriately
after transfusion of 4 units. It went from 23.3-30. GI was
consulted in this setting and plans were made for EGD and
colonoscopy to look for a source of GI bleed. Both procedures
were scheduled in OR and attempted on 5/3/05. EGD successfully
performed with evidence of gastritis , nonbleeding ulcer , and
duodenal mass with gastric heterotopia. H. pylori stool antigen
and H. pylori biopsies negative. Patient continued on Nexium 40
mg daily. Colonoscopy not obtained unable to get past the rectum
in the setting of required general anesthesia/ETT in patient's
thighs.
3. Cardiovascular/Pump - ECHO with EF equal to 65% here ,
moderate diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
hypertension. No rhythm or ischemia issues during hospital
course , low HDL , started on statin.
4. Heme/normocytic anemia , likely secondary to GI bleed with
evidence of iron deficiency. Iron stores repleted with IV iron ,
also possible anemia in setting of low EPO. EPO level checked
low and normal , may ultimately benefit from Epogen. On Coumadin
for DVT prophylaxis/paroxysmal a-fib prior to arrival.
Supratherapeutic on admission , so Coumadin held in the setting of
GI bleed until INR 1.5 , then patient was covered with
subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis. However , acute drop in
platelets in the setting of heparin from the 200s to the 30s , so
heparin stopped. PF4 antibody negative x1 and borderline x1.
PF4 antibody pending at the time of discharge , but all heparin
products including flush is held. The patient restarted on
Coumadin after EGD at 12.5 mg a day. Status post three doses ,
INR was 2. Target INR is 2-2.5 and the patient will be followed
at the Tarbripin Of Anticoagulation Clinic , phone
number is 300-135-5841. INRs can be faxed to clinic from rehab
and adjustments in doses can be made accordingly.
5. Endo: TSH within normal limits. Hemoglobin A1c 5.5 , so no
evidence of diabetes.
6. ID: UTI/proteus , levofloxacin renally dosed. Repeat urine
dirty , so p.o. Cipro started for empiric treatment of UTI in
setting of indwelling Foley. Two days prior to discharge , the
patient with low-grade temp to max 100.4. Chest x-ray unchanged
but only portable chest x-ray was obtained due to patient's
immobility , blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.
Empirically treating for nosocomial pneumonia with p.o.
levo/cefpodox/azithro x10 days , PICC line in place at time of
discharge. However , it should be discontinued by 2/22/05 to
prevent infection.
7. Allergy: Postnasal drip. Rhinorrhea. Continued Claritin
and Flonase.
8. Psyche: Zoloft continued for depression.
9. Pulmonary: Intermittent , the patient intermittently
desaturates on room air to 80s but always resolved with
repositioning and O2. Likely secondary to respiratory muscle
deconditioning and to restrictive lung disease in the setting of
morbid obesity. Continuing Flovent for asthma and albuterol nebs
p.r.n. for wheezing. Continue CPAP at night for obstructive
sleep apnea.
10. Oncology: History of breast mass last evaluated in 6/7 at
which time the risk of surgery would determine to be greater than
the possible risk of breast cancer. Oncology not able to see
patient during inpatient stay but will schedule outpatient
followup regarding the issue of possible treatment with
tamoxifen.
11. FEN: Gentle bowel regimen , renal diet.
CODE STATUS:
Full.
