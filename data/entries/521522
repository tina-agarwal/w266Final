continue aspirin , statin beta-blocker , pump. No known history of
CHF , EF 55% , total body fluid overloaded. We have restarted
Lasix 20 daily , blood pressures had been elevated. The patient
is treated right now with Lopressor , Catapres patch versus
currently 12.5 mg t.i.d. Instruction: Please titrate as
necessary to home dose of Toprol XL 50 daily. Instruction:
Continue clonidine patch , add Imdur as necessary. Rate: Atrial
fibrillation with RVR visit admit likely secondary to sepsis has
