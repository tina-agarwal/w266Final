ATTENDING: KIP ABRAM SKOKOWSKI MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Chemotherapy toxicity , atrial fibrillation , dehydration , colitis ,
liver failure.
ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:
Hypotension , diabetes mellitus , esophagitis , congestive heart
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Linsenmayer is a 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer
that was first diagnosed in 1999 , and she is status post
lumpectomy with lymph node dissection and multiple chemotherapy
regimens. She is currently on Xeloda with excellent response;
per Dr. Cagan , her outpatient oncologist , she has virtually no
evidence of metastatic disease on CT. Over the past few months ,
the patient has had chronic problems with nausea and decreased
appetite. This has become especially acute over the past week ,
and as a result , her chemotherapy is now on hold. She has also
had some worsening diarrhea , for which she was prescribed
Imodium , but because of ongoing issues with compliance , it was
felt that she was not taking enough at home. During an
outpatient visit with her cardiologist , her blood pressure was
noted to be 90/50 , so her dose of atenolol and Lasix was
decreased. Of note , the patient is status post a recent
admission to MH for digoxin toxicity , so this medication is now
also on hold. Of note , the patient is not currently on Coumadin
despite a history of atrial fibrillation due to a history of GI
bleeding , possible interactions with her chemotherapy regimen ,
and ongoing issues with medication compliance. The patient was
admitted for rehydration , management of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea ,
and control of her pain and other symptoms.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Nausea/vomiting x several months , diarrhea approximately six
times per day , worsening over the past week with green liquid
stool , no blood in stool or vomit , no abdominal pain , no urinary
symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

clubbing/cyanosis/edema , ulcer on left large toe , severely
cracked and dry skin on hands and feet.
Neuro: Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact , 5/5 strength
throughout.
LABORATORY VALUES:
Significant for creatinine 1.3 , glucose 137 , WBC 9.6 with 28
polys and 29 bands , hematocrit 38.1 , total protein 5.2 , albumin
2.0 , ALT 41 , AST 18 , alk phos 61 , total bilirubin 2.5.
An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
at approximately 140 beats/minute. No ST or T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. GI: Colitis: Given the patient's persistent and chronic
nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , there was significant concern for
small bowel obstruction on admission. However , a KUB and
abdominal CT were both negative for small bowel obstruction. She
was originally kept n.p.o. for bowel rest , and a nasogastric tube
was placed with significant drainage. Stool studies were sent
including C. difficile , ova and parasites , cecal leukocytes , and
Shigella/salmonella/Yersinia/campylobacter studies , all of which
were negative. Because of the concerning nature of the patient's
symptoms , surgery consult was called , however they felt that her
problems were likely nonsurgical in nature. CTs performed two
days and five days after admission showed identical findings of
right-sided colitis. They remained largely unchanged.
Nevertheless , the patient experienced continued nausea and
vomiting and also continued diarrhea throughout this time. Once
her nasogastric tube output decreased significantly ,
approximately one week after admission , the tube was removed and
the patient was started on p.o. , and her diet was advanced as
tolerated. From that point on , the patient had no nausea or
vomiting , and she is currently tolerating a full diet.
Nevertheless , she continues to have mild diarrhea , now two
episodes per day as compared to6 to 8 episodes per day prior to
admission. In the end , the workup for the underlying cause of
her nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea has been negative. It is
therefore our suspicion that her symptoms are most likely
secondary to toxicity from her chemotherapy medication , Xeloda.
Of note , the patient also has other signs of Xeloda toxicity ,
including possible hepatotoxicity ( see below ) as well as severe
cracking and drying of the skin on her hands and feet.
2. Hepatitis: A CT performed on admission to evaluate for small
bowel obstruction showed a significantly cirrhotic and fatty
liver with no masses. On admission , the patient's total
bilirubin was 2.5; however , her bilirubin levels escalated
precipitously to a maximum of 17.6. At the same time , the
patient developed clinical manifestations of this , including
scleral icterus and jaundice. Also , as her albumin levels
decreased to below 1.5 , she developed significant ascites and
peripheral edema. Gastroenterology consult suggested a right
upper quadrant ultrasound , which was negative for obstruction , a
hepatic MRI , which also showed a cirrhotic and fatty liver , and
also a diagnostic/therapeutic IR guided paracentesis , which
drained 1 liter of sterile fluid. Hepatitis serologies were also
sent , and the patient was hepatitis A and B negative , but C
positive; however , her viral load was less than assay , and her
AFP was within normal limits. A rheumatologic workup for
autoimmune hepatitis was also negative. Because of the acuteness
and the timing of her presentation , it was felt that her liver
failure was likely secondary to a combination of hepatitis and
also toxicity from her Xeloda.
On discharge , the patient's hepatic function had been improving
significantly for three days , with her albumin increasing , her
INR decreasing and her bilirubin levels also decreasing. On
discharge , her total bilirubin was 16.0 down from 17.6 , her
albumin was 1.9 up from 1.5 , and her INR was 1.6 down from 2.6.
It is anticipated that as the patient's nutritional status
continues to improve , her hepatic function will continue to
normalize with resulting normalization of her laboratory values.
3. Cardiovascular: On admission , the patient was in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the rate of
approximately 140 beats per minute. She was also hypotensive ,
with a blood pressure of roughly 90/60. She was placed on
cardiac telemetry , which recorded rapid a. fib. up to the 170s.
As a result , she was given IV Lopressor with decreased heart rate
but also significant reduction in her blood pressure requiring
fluid boluses. After 24 hours , after her blood pressure had
stabilized following the administration of intravenous fluids ,
she was started on a diltiazem drip at 5 mg per hour , which
helped to establish stable rate control in the 80s with continued
atrial fibrillation. At the same time , the patient was loaded
with digoxin , but her levels were high; given that the patient
was status post a recent admission for digoxin toxicity , this
medication was subsequently held. In one incident , the patient
developed a temporary junctional rhythm for approximately 5
minutes with a heart rate in the 50s. At that point , input was
elicited from the cardiology consult service , who thought that
her symptoms were likely secondary to the diltiazem drip.
However , given concern for a tachy-brady syndrome , the
possibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker was discussed.
However , the patient did not have any recurrence of the
junctional rhythm. A TTE was obtained , which showed an ejection
fraction of 60% with trace MR and moderate TR , left and right
atrial enlargement , and normal left and right ventricular
function. Once the patient was again taking p.o. medications ,
her diltiazem drip was changed to p.o. diltiazem. For the next
several days , the patient had several episodes each night of 3 to
5 beat runs of NSVT. However , on the three days prior to
discharge , the patient had no events on telemetry , and her heart
rate was stable in the 60s to 80s , with a blood pressure running
from 90-100/50-60. Shortly before discharge , the patient also
developed episodic shortness of breath , which was attributed to
mild pulmonary edema , and she responded well to boluses of IV
Lasix. As a result , she was restarted on Aldactone with
effective gentle diuresis. The plan on discharge will be to
follow her volume status carefully and to adjust her diuretic
regimen as needed to maintain her volume status with continued
improvement in her hepatic function.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus ,
and her metformin was held on admission secondary to an elevated
creatinine. As a result , she was started on a lispro sliding
scale. Given that she was n.p.o. for several days , she was not
given any insulin and her blood sugars remained stable in the low
100s. After she again started taking p.o. , she was restarted on
a sliding scale , and she maintained excellent blood sugar control
between 100 and 150. A hemoglobin A1c obtained during this
admission was also within normal limits. Of note , the patient
has a left toe ulcer , and was seen by orthopedic surgeries and
outpatient totally before admission.
5. Heme: The patient had an INR of 2.6 on admission secondary to
cirrhosis and poor nutrition. As a result , she was given vitamin
K subcu n.p.o. as needed. As noted above , despite a history of
atrial fibrillation , the patient is not on Coumadin at home
secondary to poor med compliance. At home , she was only on
aspirin , but this was also discontinue during the admission
secondary to continued guaiac positive stool. Nevertheless , her
hematocrit remained stable throughout her admission and she did
not require any transfusions. As DVT prophylaxis , the patient
was kept on Pneumo boots throughout the admission. At one point ,
she was noted to have left upper extremity swelling greater than
the right upper extremity , but an ultrasound was negative for
DVT. As noted above , on discharge , the patient's INR was
improving secondary to improved nutrition. She will be
discharged without any anticoagulation at present , however this
can be further reevaluated as an outpatient by her cardiologist
and oncologist.
6. FEN: The patient was initially rehydrated with normal saline ,
however this was changed to D5W plus 3 amps of bicarb since she
developed a bicarb gap. Once this gap was closed , she was given
gentle normal saline as maintenance fluids. Once the patient
started taking significant p.o. , her IV fluids were discontinued.
The patient's electrolytes were also repleted as necessary.
Plan on discharge will be to continue following her electrolytes
closely to prevent further exacerbation of her cardiac
arrhythmias.
7. Pain: The patient was given oxycodone p.o. and morphine IV
for pain. The patient was previously on Vioxx at home for
orthopedic pain related to her diabetes , however , given recent
data suggesting possible cardiotoxic effects of Vioxx , this will
be discontinued , and she will be sent home with oxycodone p.r.n.
for pain.
8. Onc: The patient's Xeloda is currently on hold since many of
her symptoms leading up to this admission were likely secondary
to chemo toxicity. As noted above , the patient has other
evidence of chemo toxicity as well , including significantly dried
skin on her hands and feet. The patient's outpatient oncologist ,
Dr. Willard Brixius , followed her closely during this admission , and
she will follow up with the patient regarding possible changes to
her chemotherapy regimen.
9. Disposition: The patient was seen by the physical therapy
service shortly before discharge , and they noted that she
displayed difficulty even moving from the bed to the chair , which
is significantly below her baseline of being able to ambulate
independently. As a result , after extensive discussions with her
family , it was decided that the patient will be best served by
going to a rehab facility for continued closed supervision of her
medical problems , supervised administration of her medication
regimen , continued strength training and conditioning , and also
continued nutrition. Once the patient is able to be less
dependent on outside assistance , she can be sent home with either
a home health aide or visiting nurse for continued
rehabilitation. Of note , the patient's code status was
established by her outpatient oncologist as DNR/DNI. This was
confirmed with the patient during this hospitalization.

DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition.
PHYSICIAN FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation facility , where
she will continue to be given supportive care for ongoing
symptoms of her enteritis and hepatic failure. She will also
receive physical therapy and nutrition to help her return to her
baseline function. Prior to discharge from rehab , her medication
regimen should be simplified as much as possible to prevent
future confusion over her medications , as has happened in the
past.
On discharge from rehab , the patient should be sent home with
either a visiting nurse or home health aide , as insurance
permits. At that point , she will follow up with Dr. Snellbaker , her
primary care physician; Dr. Fushimi , her outpatient oncologist; and
Dr. Khalili , her outpatient cardiologist.
