ATTENDING: HICKAM , TOM SIMON MD
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Jason Vanwechel , M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Diabetes.
4. Hypertension.
5. History of upper gastrointestinal bleed.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 65-year-old gentleman with
history of COPD , CHF , and stage IV chronic renal insufficiency ,
who presented to the emergency room on 7/17/2005 with wheezing
and shortness of breath following a three-day prodrome of cough ,
congestion , and chills. In the emergency room , the patient was
noted to have a BNP of 519 and was initially treated with Lasix
in the emergency room , and was admitted at that point for
diagnosis of COPD exacerbation in the setting of an upper
respiratory infection in addition to mild congestive heart
failure. The patient was given oral glucocorticoids and frequent
bronchodilator therapy was initiated. However , the patient's
mental status began to rapidly decline. As he became more
somnolent , he was noted to have an ABG with a pH of 7.16. The
patient was then transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic
respiratory failure after failing an initial trial of BiPAP.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , requiring at least two prior
intubations; congestive heart failure , previously thought to be
diastolic with an EF of 50%; diabetes , hypertension , history of
upper GI bleed in 8/27 secondary to an antral ulcer , pneumonia
in 10/1 left lower lobe nodule , which is stable on followup
CTs; chronic renal insufficiency , thought secondary to diabetes
and hypertension.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a former smoker with rare alcohol
use. He lives alone and he is a retired chef.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of diabetes. Father had congestive
heart failure. Brother has a history of pituitary cancer and
another brother with lymphoma.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiloride 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Clonodine 7.5 mg topically weekly.
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily.
4. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Lasix 160 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Labetalol 600 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. NPH 25 units in the morning and 15 units in the evening.
8. Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily.
9. Calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily.
10. Advair.
11. Albuterol/Combivent.
ALLERGIES: IBUPROFEN WITH WORSENING RENAL FAILURE.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Temperature 100.6 , heart
rate 88 , respiratory rate 28 , blood pressure 158/90 , and
saturating 99% on 2 L nasal cannula. General: This is a
pleasant , mildly overweight African-American male visibly
wheezing and speaking in short phrases. HEENT: Pupils are
equal , round , and reactive to light. Oropharynx is clear. Neck:
Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: Tachycardic. No
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. JVP was increased. Respiratory:
Crackles , bibasilar. Notable for diffuse wheezes. Minimal air
movement. Peak flow was measured at 200. Abdomen: Soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bowel sounds are present.
Extremities: Mild clubbing and trace edema bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES UPON ADMISSION: Notable for electrolyte panel
within normal limits. BUN of 52 , creatinine of 3.3 , and glucose
of 154. BNP was 317. Hemogram showed a white blood cell count
of 7.7 , hematocrit 40.6 , and platelets 219. MCV was low at 80.
Chest x-ray showed interstitial edema , no infiltrates. EKG
showed no acute changes from prior.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 65-year-old male with history of
COPD who is admitted for a COPD exacerbation in the setting of a
likely viral URI as well as some mild congestive heart failure
exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Pulmonary: As noted above , the
patient was noted to be having hypercarbic respiratory failure
with an ABG of 7.16/98/89 on 3 L nasal cannula. He was therefore
transferred to the MICU and at that time required intubation.
The patient's respiratory status improved and he was extubated on
10/29/2005 .  The patient was initially treated with Solu-Medrol ,
which was changed to prednisone on 4/29/2005 .  The patient was
noted to have thick tenacious secretions and there was concern
for possible pneumonia as an underlying flare for the patient's
COPD. Therefore , the patient was initiated on levofloxacin for a
14-day course. The patient had , upon presentation , been noted to
be mildly volume overloaded but this improved with diuresis prior
to his MICU stay. In the setting of the patient's intubation ,
his pH corrected slowly , but he was still noted to have markedly
elevated partial CO2 pressures. The patient was treated with
chest PT as well as Duonebs. Following extubation , the patient
was transferred to the floor and did well. Medications were
adjusted and he was continued on a prednisone taper , Spiriva ,
Advair 250/50 Diskus , supplemental oxygen , Duonebs , and albuterol
nebulizers as needed. The patient continued to improve , and on
5/7/2005 , he was able to ambulate on room air without dyspnea
or hypoxia. At this point , we suggest outpatient pulmonary
function tests to further evaluate the extent of the patient's
obstructive disease.
Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient underwent a negative rule
out MI upon admission. This was obtained due to the newly
decreased EF of 35 to 40% that was noted on echocardiogram upon
admission. The patient has not had any ischemic symptoms;
however , this marked decrease is concerning especially including
the inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis , which is new from
his prior echocardiogram. The patient was continued on aspirin ,
beta-blocker , and statin. An ACE inhibitor was reinitiated when
the patient's creatinine stabilized. The patient will likely
need further cardiac risk stratification as an outpatient to
include an outpatient stress test.
Pump: As mentioned , upon admission , the patient was noted to
have mild volume overload. He has a history of diastolic
dysfunction with a prior echocardiogram showing an EF of 50%. As
noted , the most recent echocardiogram obtained during this
hospitalization shows an EF of 35% with diffuse global
hypokinesis and inferior posterior wall akinesis. There was mild
decreased function of the RV as well , and mild left atrial
enlargement and mild right atrial enlargement. The patient is
noted to have relatively stable pulmonary hypertension with a PA
pressure of 50 plus right atrial pressure.
The patient had been diuresed aggressively in the emergency room
and therefore did not require additional diuresis upon transfer
to the MICU. The patient was initiated on hydralazine and
Isordil for afterload reduction. When the patient's creatinine
stabilized , these were changed back to an ACE inhibitor. The
patient was continued on a beta-blocker as well. The patient was
restarted on half of his home dose of Lasix at Lasix 160 mg p.o.
daily as of 4/2/2006 when he was noted to be mildly
hypervolemic.
In addition , the patient was noted to have significant
hypertension. He has had a workup previously for secondary
causes of hypertension , which included a negative MRA in 2004.
The patient was continued on a clonodine patch as well as
beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , and Imdur. The patient's home
medication of hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued , as was the
amiloride , which may need to be reinitiated as an outpatient.
Rhythm: The patient was noted to have four beats of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia on 6/29/2005 , which resolved with
aggressive electrolyte replacement. While in the MICU , the
patient had a single run of 30 beats of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia , which improved with electrolyte replacement.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and therefore
was continued on a regimen of NPH initially at 20 units b.i.d.
The patient was noted to have an episode of hypoglycemia with
blood sugars around 40 and therefore the NPH was decreased and
the patient will be discharged on a regimen of 15 units in the
morning and 10 units at bedtime.
The patient was also noted to have hyperparathyroidism likely
from renal disease , therefore secondary versus tertiary
hyperparathyroidism. The patient was therefore continued on
calcitriol.
Renal: The patient has stage IV chronic renal insufficiency.
Upon admission , the patient was noted to be oliguric. This is
likely due to a prerenal state given diuresis on admission and
further exacerbated by the patient's underlying renal disease.
Bladder scan was obtained which only showed 3 mL of urine in the
bladder. The patient's urine output increased with afterload
reduction. The patient was noted to have acute-on-chronic
respiratory acidosis with chronic bicarbonate compensation.
There was no anion gap. The lactate was measured and was only
0.6 in the MICU. Throughout the remainder of the
hospitalization , the patient's creatinine continued to improve
and was measured at 3.4 on 4/2/2006 .  A renal consult was
obtained during the hospitalization. They did not feel that
there was any indication for acute renal replacement. The
patient should continue to have renally dosed meds and continue
on a renal diet , including Phoslo. The patient will have close
renal followup within the next few weeks.
Hematologic: The patient was noted to have iron deficiency
anemia and was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation. At
this time , an EPO level is still pending.
Infectious Disease: The patient was initiated on levofloxacin
for a 14-day course , which was started on 3/13/2005 , and will be
completed as of 1/18/2006 .  Blood cultures and sputum cultures
were obtained and are negative to date. Influenza/adenovirus/RSV
swabs were obtained and were negative.
Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin subcutaneous 5000
units t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis , and was continued on Pepcid for
GI prophylaxis.
DISPOSITION: The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and
felt to be at his baseline. He is able to ambulate and maintain
his pulse oxymetry greater than 93%. The patient will be
discharged to home with visiting nurse service.
TO DO:
1. VNA is to check the patient's blood pressure , oxygen
saturation , as well as check weekly electrolytes and creatinine
levels and call results to Dr. Loil office at 310-282-9488.
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Johanns within the next week ,
and at that time , should have his blood pressure meds titrated up
as needed. The patient may require increased dose of Lasix and
the amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be resumed as needed.
2. The patient should have a cardiology outpatient followup
regarding his decreased EF and new wall motion abnormalities.
The patient may require stress imaging for further cardiac risk
stratification.
3. The patient should have renal follow up regarding his chronic
renal insufficiency and future need for hemodialysis.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Continue to take all of your medications ,
including the Spiriva and Advair , which replace the Flovent as
well as the prednisone. Follow up with Dr. Lapeyrouse within one
week. Participate with your visiting nurse services. Seek
