Autologous blood was necessary. He was required to maintain a
hematocrit above 30. He remained afebrile. Normal perioperative
antibiotics were given , however. His p.o. intake was delayed
secondary to delay in return of GI function. He did have an
episode of dark emesis early in his postoperative course on
