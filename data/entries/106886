ADDENDUM
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Midget is a 56-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for inferior myocardial
infarction in 1995 , which was treated with angioplasty at that
time. Since then , he has been stable on medical management until
approximately two months prior to this admission , when he began
noting anterior chest pain with exertion. He underwent a stress
test , which was found to be abnormal , and was referred for cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was performed on
10/3/06 at Au Hospital . This study revealed a
70% proximal stenosis of his left anterior descending coronary
artery , a 90% mid segment stenosis of his first diagonal coronary
artery , a 50% mid segment stenosis of his circumflex coronary
artery , a 90% ostial stenosis of his first obtuse marginal , a
100% proximal stenosis of his right coronary artery as well as a
30% ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery. Collateral
flow was noted from the left anterior descending to the posterior
descending coronary artery. Given the results of this cardiac
catheterization , he was referred for elective revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is
significant for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , lower back
pain , nephrolithiasis as well as a 3.4 cm infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm at the bifurcation of the aorta.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for open cholecystectomy in
the 1990s as well as removal of a cyst from his left wrist in
2005. In addition , the patient underwent lithotripsy in August of
2006.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports a family history of coronary
artery disease. His brother has undergone coronary artery bypass
grafting in the past and his mother , father and brother all have
suffered myocardial infarction. He also has a significant family
history of hypertension in both of his parents.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient reports a 20-pack-year cigarette
smoking history as well as a history of social alcohol use ,
approximately five to six beers on the weekend.
ALLERGIES: The patient reports no known drug allergies , however
tetanus immunization in the past has led to arm swelling.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 100 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril
40 mg p.o. daily , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mg
p.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o. daily , Vicodin 5 mg p.o. as
needed for low back pain as well as vitamins C , D , A , and E.
The patient was seen in the Lumne Medical Center on 1/25/06
and underwent physical examination.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination at that time revealed
the patient to be afebrile with resting heart rate of 52 beats
per minute and regular. The patient had a resting blood pressure
of 142/76 in the right arm and 148/76 in the left arm. He had a
room air oxygen saturation of 95%. Examination of the head ,
eyes , ears , nose and throat revealed the pupils to be equal ,
round , reactive to light and accommodation. The dentition was
without evidence of infection and carotid bruits were not
appreciable bilaterally over the carotid arteries. Examination
of the heart revealed it to be in regular rate and rhythm with a
grade 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal
border. Examination of the lungs revealed breath sounds to be
clear bilaterally throughout all lung fields. Examination of the
abdomen revealed a well-healed right upper quadrant incision
consistent with prior open cholecystectomy. Examination of the
extremities revealed them to be without scarring , varicosities or
edema and pulses were 2+ and equal to full extent of all
extremities. Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented
x3 with no focal neurological deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory values obtained in the Landsea Charle Memorial Hospital on 1/25/06 included a sodium of 139 , potassium of
3.7 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of 82 , magnesium of
1.6 , white blood cell count of 10.9 , hematocrit 49.2 , and
platelet count of 386 , 000. Coagulation studies were within
normal limits with an INR of 1 and the urinalysis was within
normal limits. Cardiac catheterization data from 10/3/06 are as
stated above in the history of present illness. Echocardiogram
performed on 8/29/06 revealed a 65% ejection fraction with
trivial mitral valve insufficiency and no noted regional wall
motion abnormalities. EKG obtained on 10/3/06 showed a normal
sinus rhythm at 55 beats per minute with no acute ST or T-wave
changes. Chest x-ray performed on 1/25/2006 was without
evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 0/16/06 as a
same-day admission and was taken directly to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 including
the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the ramus and second
obtuse marginal coronary arteries and the left radial artery to
the right coronary artery. Significant times of this operation
included a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 173 minutes with an
aortic cross-clamp time of 156 minutes. For further details of
this operation , please refer to the dictated operative note. The
patient's immediate postoperative period was uncomplicated. He
was extubated on the day of surgery and considered a good
candidate for transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #1. His temporary cardiac
pacing wires and chest drainage tubes and a Jackson-Pratt drain
were all discontinued on postoperative day #2. On the Step-Down
Unit , he was noted to have a high white blood cell count of
approximately 17 in the immediate perioperative period , however
the white blood cell count had improved markedly to 11.9 by
postoperative day #3. He had a PA and lateral chest x-ray on
postoperative day #3 , which revealed satisfactory postoperative
appearance of the chest. The patient was ambulating and
tolerating a full diet without difficulty and is now considered
in good candidate for discharge to home with visiting nurse
services on 7/4/06 , postoperative day #4.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Medications at the time of discharge
include aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily ,
diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. as needed
for constipation , Zetia 10 mg p.o. daily , fenofibrate 145 mg p.o.
daily , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily x5 days , K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily x5
days , metformin 500 mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily ,
and oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.4 h. as needed for pain.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is instructed to make and
keep all of his follow-up appointments and shower and wash his
wounds with soap and water each day. He is to continue diuresis
with Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily for five days and then discontinue
until his re-evaluation at a follow-up appointment with his PCP
or cardiologist and 1-2 weeks. Of note , this patient was
diagnosed for the first time as a type II diabetic during this
admission with a hemoglobin A1c of 7.2 prior to admission. He
was followed by the Diabetes Management Service postoperatively ,
and was started on metformin 500 mg a day and should follow up
with his primary care physician in 1-2 weeks for follow-up check
of his blood sugar and any necessary adjustment in his diabetic
medications. He is instructed to make follow-up appointments
with his cardiac surgeon Dr. Jakowich for two weeks following
discharge from the hospital and to return to see his primary care
physician , Dr. Parmalee one to two weeks following discharge from
the hospital.
