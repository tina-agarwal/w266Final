HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58 year old white male with
a history of peripheral vascular
disease and old left hemispheric cerebrovascular accident who
presents with a right sided arm weakness and numbness. In 1981 ,
the patient suffered a left hemispheric cerebrovascular accident
which resulted in shortterm memory loss and right sided weakness ,
leg greater than arm. The right sided deficit eventually resolved ,
however , his lower leg remained numbness and weak , distal greater
than proximal. Ten days prior to admission , the patient
experienced a transient episode of loss of vision in his right eye.

disappeared and his normal vision returned. Two days prior to
admission , patient began to experience chest pain and subsequently
took sublingual Nitroglycerin. He states that his pain briefly
improved but would then recur much more severely. This complex

he began to feel increasing weakness in his right hand. The
sensation increased over the course of the entire day and became

became concerned that he might have had a stroke ( the weakness
reminded him of his previous cerebrovascular accident ) and he
