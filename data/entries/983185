HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 40 year old female with a
history of cholelithiasis who was
recently discharged from Asce Medical Center on June ,
l990 after an incisional hernia repair who , soon after , noted onset
of right upper quadrant pain , vomiting , and fever and was
readmitted with an ultrasound at that time showing two 8-9 mm
gallstones in the right upper quadrant. Patient was treated with
intravenous antibiotics but deferred surgery at that time and was
discharged home after defervescing. Approximately six weeks prior
to admission , the patient was seen in the Emergency Ward for
recurrent right upper quadrant pain without nausea , vomiting , or
fever. The patient then was subsequently seen by Dr. Bellman in the
Chica Onant Hospital and a cholecystectomy was scheduled on a
routine basis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Non-contributory. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes a cesarean section in l988 and a
ventral hernia repair in March of l990. CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Naprosyn as needed for right upper quadrant pain. ALLERGIES:
Include Penicillin which gives her a rash and Compazine which leads
to a dystonic reaction. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke or
drink.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs. SKIN: Scattered skin tags on her
trunk. NODES: Negative. HEAD/NECK: Benign. BREASTS: Without
masses , tenderness , or axillary adenopathy. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs ,
gallops , or rubs. PULSES: 2+ bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
positive bowel sounds , and non-tender with a small fascial defect
at the umbilicus and a well healed midline scar. NEUROLOGICAL:
Non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 7l
beats per minute with an axis of positive
40 degrees , normal intervals , and no ischemic changes. Her chest
X-Ray was clear. Her electrolytes were all within normal limits ,
her BUN was 22 , and her creatinine was l.0. Her glucose was 88.
Her white count was 6.4 , her hematocrit was 33.l , and her platelets
were 259. Her PT was l2.3 and her PTT was 29.9. Her urinalysis
showed 3-4 white blood cells and l+ bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient arrived the same day as her surgery
and was taken directly to the Operating Room.
Patient was placed under general anesthesia and her intubation was
particularly difficult secondary to obesity requiring fiberoptic
intubation and Anesthesia elected , at this time , to place both an
A-line and a central venous access in order to be able to optimally
monitor this difficult obese patient. Patient then underwent a
very uncomplicated cholecystectomy at which time a distended
gallbladder with several stones was found. The patient was taken
to the Recovery Room in stable condition after being extubated. Her
O2 saturation on 40% facemask was 96% in the Recovery Room and both
her nasogastric tube and Foley tube were removed without incident.
Her A-line was also removed before transfer to the floor but her
central line remained in place until the following day. Patient
received two doses of Gentamicin as prophylaxis post-operatively.
The patient had an unremarkable post-operative course with a
post-operative hematocrit of 3l.5 and white count of 8.4. Her diet
was slowly advanced and she remained afebrile with good oxygen
saturations on room air and good urine output.
DISOSITION: She was discharged to home on post-operative day
number five with an appointment to follow-up in the
Ingtondi Community Healthcare on Thursday , March , for a wound check.
