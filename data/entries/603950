STUDIES:
Cardiac PET:
Final impression:
The patient's PET-CT test results are abnormal and consistent
with the following:
1. Mild calcified coronary plaque burden.
2. A medium size area of prior MI in the distal LAD territory ,
with evidence of mild residual stress-induced peri-infarct
ischemia.
3. Severe LV systolic dysfunction.
ECHO:
Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is moderately dilated. There is
severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular
function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55%. There are no
obvious akinetic areas.
Right Ventricle: The right ventricle is not well seen. The right
ventricular size is normal. Global right ventricular systolic function
is normal.
Left Atrium: There is moderate left atrial enlargement.
Right Atrium: The right atrium is mildly dilated.
Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is trileaflet , mildly thickened , and
calcified.
There are mildly elevated transaortic gradients consistent with aortic
sclerosis. There is mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is mildly diffusely thickened. There is
trace
************************************************
A/P: 52M w/ hx of HTN , w/ hx of progressive SOB , LEE , x mos with
acute worsening in last few days w/ associated troponin
leak.
1 ) ISCHEMIA: Small troponin leak which resolved - demand in setting of
CHF and HTN. ASA 325 , lipitor 80. Elevated LDL 113. homocysteine
WNL , hga1c elevated , CRP normal. Caridac PET notable for mild
calcified coronary plaque burden , med sized area of poor perfusion
suggestive of prior MI in distal LAD territiory. LVEF 35%.
2 ) PUMP: New CHF - ischemic vs hypertrophic vs alcoholic cardiomyopathy ,
exacerbation due to slow volume accumulations ( NSAIDs , Amoxicillin ,
dietary non-compliance ) - ECHO shows EF 55% , severe cLVH , AI. Diuresed
approx 10 liters with IV lasix. Weight from 155 kg ( admit ) to 149.5 kg
( discharge ). Lisinopril increased to 40 QD.
3 ) RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation in setting of volume overload which
resolved with diuresis and beta blockade. Pt had a failed DC
cardioversion. Anticoagulated initially with heparin bridging to
Coumadin.
4 ) Heme/Anticoagulation: Pt started on coumadin 10 mg daily x 2 days
prior to discharge. INR 1.1 and ___ prior the 2 days prior to discharge.
Pt sent home with lovenox bridge. Will be followed at AMC coumadin
clinic.
5 ) EtOHism - MVI/thiamine/folate. No signs of alcohol withdrawal.
6 ) Nutrition - 2L fluid restrict , 2 gram sodium diet , nutrition
consulted/educated in house.
