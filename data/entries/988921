Cardiology Broketroit Ma Ri
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Wetterauer is a 54-year-old female
with coronary artery disease status
post inferior myocardial infarction in March of 1997 , with sick
sinus syndrome , status post permanent pacemaker placement , and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation controlled with amiodarone; also
with history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was
admitted to the Crotamp Hospital for severe respiratory
distress on 3/28 The summary of clinical events is as follows.
The evening of 1/11 , the patient was having intercourse and
"collapsed." She was very short of breath with this , and presented
to the Emergency Department via the paramedics. They attempted to
intubate her on the field and found her pulse oxygen to be about 60
percent on bag valve mask. They were unable to do so. She was
described during this episode by her husband as to have been
"gurgling." She began to describe shortness of breath , and took
her inhalers which did not help. She began to cough quite a bit
and coughed up some frothy white sputum. At the Emergency
Department , she was immediately intubated at Sirose
There was some difficulty intubating her , and she was ultimately
intubated by the attending anesthesiologist there. An
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 30 percent with
flat CKs. She was diuresed six liters with a stable BUN and
creatinine and was extubated on 1/19 A right heart
catheterization there showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 40/15 ,
wedge of 12 , cardiac output of 5.2. Hemodymanics in the Intensive
Care Unit at Chebanks Hospital indicate the patient's cardiac output
was quite dependent on her SVR. Her cardiac index fell into the
high two's when her SVR was in the 1340 range , but jumped up into
the high three's at about 3.8 when her SVR was much lower down in
the 800s. At the outside hospital , a right upper lobe infiltrate
was also noted and she was given gentamicin 250 mg times one , and
clindamycin 600 mg. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated
with clindamycin , this caused resolution of her white count at the
outside hospital. She also had an increase in her Lasix and
lisinopril dose there , as well as her amiodarone. She was started
on Solu-Medrol 40 mg intravenous q.6 hours for possible asthma.
She did quite well after her treatment for pneumonia and treatment
for pulmonary edema , and was transferred to the Misutch University Hospital for further management.
Her last admission was on 10/6 to the Ceter Medical Center
for atypical chest pain , when she had a nondiagnostic exercise
tolerance test. She went 6 minutes and 19 seconds with a maximum
heart rate of 94. Her chest pain then was ultimately attributed to
a gastrointestinal cause.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post inferior
myocardial infarction on 9/16 She was last
admitted , as noted above , on 10/6 to the Lordchild Hospital for atypical
chest pain. The patient has sick sinus syndrome and is status post
dual chamber pacemaker in 6/15 Diabetes mellitus. Hypertension.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , well-controlled in the past on
amiodarone. Past rhythm monitoring has revealed brief runs of
ventricular tachycardia. Negative breast biopsy in 2/13
MEDICATIONS: Home medications include amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Prempro 0.625/2.5 p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Coumadin , nitroglycerin sublingual , Zantac , beclomethasone , and
Ventolin.
Medications on transfer , Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 p.o.
q.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , clindamycin 600 intravenous
q.8 , digoxin 0.25 , Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. , Zantac , Albuterol ,
Flovent , Solu-Medrol , and amiodarone 300 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a ten pack year smoking history
and quit in 1968. No intravenous drug use. She
is retired from Medical Records at SGH . She has three grown
children and she is married.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission is
significant for a blood pressure of 114/93 ,
this is down from a very high blood pressure on admission at the
outside hospital which was in the 200s. Pulse is 60 , temperature
is 96.5 , saturating 97 percent on two liters. General , this is an
agitated woman in no acute distress. Her neck veins were about 5.0
to 6.0 cm of water. The lung examination showed a few crackles in
the left base with the right one clear. Cardiovascular examination
revealed a split S1 and normal S2 , also a soft S3 , the presence of
a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border
was noted. The abdomen was benign , no hepatosplenomegaly noted.
The extremities showed no edema , with intact distal pulses.
Neurologically , the patient was alert and oriented times three with
no focal deficits , but careful neurologic examination was
impossible due to severe agitation and anxiety.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory on admission was significant for a
Troponin of 0.02 , CK of 80 , INR of 1.3 ,
hematocrit of 38.0 , BUN/creatinine of 24/0.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Digerolamo was admitted to the Aley Coness-o Meoak Medical Center and managed by problems as follows.
Flash Pulmonary Edema: The initial concern for Mrs. Kozicki was of
this being an ischemic event causing her to have flash pulmonary
edema. However , coronary catheterization revealed the patient to
have clean coronaries. Echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular
hypertrophy with a low normal systolic function , with an ejection
fraction of 50 to 55 percent. There was akinesis of the inferior
wall present. She had normal right ventricular size and function.
She had 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation with mild left atrial
enlargement and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation with a regurgitive
velocity of about 2.7 meters per second consistent with minimal
pulmonary systolic pressures. Subsequently the patient was noted
to have had a history of hypothyroidism in the past , and she had
normal TSH recently checked by her primary care physician , Dr.
Slipper , of TCH . However , with no other etiology present , we
were worried about the patient having had tachyarrhythmia from some
other source causing this. The Electrophysiology Service
interrogated the patient's pacer which revealed a number of
tachyarrhythmias. A TSH panel was checked which revealed a TSH of
less than assay , and T4 free thyroxin index elevated. An
Endocrinology consultation was obtained , and they believed that the
patient's thyrotoxicosis was amiodarone induced. She was started
on Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. They also suggested prednisone , but
the patient did refuse this. They recommended follow-up with
Endocrine in about four to six weeks. Therefore , the final
etiology for the patient's flash pulmonary edema was amiodarone
induced thyrotoxicosis causing increased susceptibility to
tachyarrhythmia , left ventricular hypertrophy , and possible
diastolic dysfunction , resulting in acute pump dysfunction , causing
flash pulmonary edema. The final therapy for this problem will
consist of heavy nodal blockade. The patient will be blockaded
with calcium channel blockers , as well as Lopressor.
Pneumonia: The patient was treated with clindamycin and did quite
well. Her white count fully resolved and she had no fever or other
symptoms of pneumonia. She will be discharged without any further
antibiotics.
Urinary Tract Infection: She had a lot of uric crystals , therefore
she was placed on Bactrim Double Strength b.i.d. times a total of
seven days.
Psychiatry: The patient has clearly severe anxiety and was in a
full panic attack on admission. She was treated acutely with
Ativan and her problem resolved quite well , and she became more
comfortable in the hospital.
Diabetes Mellitus: Glyburide was held initially on admission. She
was covered with insulin sliding scale. Glyburide was restarted on
the day of discharge. The patient was noted to have relatively
high blood sugars , and these should be followed as an outpatient.
Blood sugars as high as the mid 300s were noted.
Edema: The patient clearly had some fluid accumulation which
resolved with 20 mg of Lasix p.o. q.d. We will continue this and
allow outpatient follow-up to determine whether or not she will
need this in the future.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE: Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Tapazole 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 5.0
mg p.o. q.p.m. , Bactrim Double Strength one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
times four days after discharge , Prempro 0.625/2.5 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 150 mg
p.o. q.d. , diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in good condition.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Thyrotoxicosis.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr. Provins on Monday , 3/22
at 9:30 a.m. , and Dr. Orejel of Chia Memorial Hospital Endocrinology at U Hay Rill , on 6/5 at 3:00
p.m.
