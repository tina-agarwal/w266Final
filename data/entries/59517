Discharge Date: 8/14/2006
ATTENDING: MORGUSON , AURELIO M.D.
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Goodwine is a 78-year-old
gentleman with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and
myocardial infarction in 1998 with known ejection fraction of
20%. PET scan in March of 2006 revealed decreasing ejection
fraction and severe left anterior descending territory perfusion
defect. The patient was planned to be electively cathed , but has
deferred until now because of seasonal allergies. The patient
admits to baseline dyspnea on exertion. Cardiac catheterization
from 3/10/06 revealed the following: Left anterior descending
coronary artery with a proximal 85% stenosis and a mid 70%
stenosis , first diagonal coronary artery with an ostial 95%
stenosis , left circumflex coronary artery with a 90% ostial
stenosis and a 75% proximal stenosis , right coronary artery with
a 30% proximal stenosis , right dominant circulation.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% with mild
mitral insufficiency , trivial tricuspid insufficiency , moderate
pulmonic insufficiency , the mid and distal anterior septum ,
entire apex , posterior wall , basal inferior segment and basal
septum segments are akinetic. The anterolateral wall , basal
anterior septum segment , mid septum segment and mid inferior
segments are hypokinetic. Global right ventricular systolic
function is moderately reduced. The patient also has a history
of class III heart failure with marked limitation of physical
activity and recent signs and symptoms of congestive heart
failure including pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension ,
peripheral vascular disease , dyslipidemia , renal failure , peptic
ulcer disease with history of upper GI bleed and anxiety
disorder.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to heparin , he is HIT
positive , and to sulfa where he develops a rash.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Toprol 37.5 mg daily , quinapril 5 mg
daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , Claritin and Nasacort.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 5 feet 8 inches , 63.2 kg , temperature
96.4 , heart rate is 79 and regular , blood pressure right arm
88/60 , left arm is 90/64 and O2 saturation is 94% on room air.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or
heaves. Peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally throughout.
Respiratory , breath sounds clear bilaterally with distant breath
sounds. Is otherwise noncontributory.
Admission labs; sodium 138 , potassium 3.9 , chloride of 104 , CO2
of 28 , BUN of 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose of 119 and magnesium
1.8. WBC 8.02 , hematocrit 40.7 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets of
134 , 000. PT 14 , PT-INR of 1.1 and PTT of 29.1. Carotid
noninvasives were also performed , which revealed a left internal
carotid artery with 25-49% occlusion and a right internal carotid
artery with a 1 to 25% occlusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Valido was brought to the operating room on
0/9/06 where he underwent an elective coronary artery bypass
graft x3 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the first
obtuse marginal coronary artery and a saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery. Total bypass time was 85
minutes. Total crossclamp time was 65 minutes.
Intraoperatively , the transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 25% with no tricuspid regurgitation. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and in stable condition on epinephrine and Levophed.
Postoperatively , the patient did well. He required transfusion
of 1 unit of packed red blood cells for some postoperative anemia
and was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day
#2. The patient was seen by the Physical Therapy Service and
recommended rehabilitation after discharge and he was cleared for
transfer to rehab on postoperative day #4. He otherwise has had
an unremarkable postoperative course.
DISCHARGE LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride of 105 , CO2
29 , BUN of 18 and creatinine 1.0. Glucose 107 , magnesium 1.7 ,
WBC 10.11 , hematocrit 28.6 , hemoglobin 9.5 , platelets of 146 , 000 ,
PT 13.8 , PT/INR 1.1 and PTT of 29.9.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vitamin C 500 mg b.i.d. , Lipitor 40 mg
daily , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg daily for
three days along with potassium chloride slow release 20 mEq a
day for three days , Dilaudid 1 to 2 mg q.4 h. p.r.n. pain , Motrin
600 mg q. 8 h. p.r.n. pain , NovoLog sliding scale q.a.c. and at
bedtime , NovoLog 4 units subq q.a.c. , Lopressor 25 mg q.i.d. ,
Niferex 150 mg b.i.d. and multivitamin therapeutic 1 tab p.o.
daily.
Mr. Oberman will be transferred to rehab in stable condition. He
will follow up with Dr. Stanton Boyle in six weeks and his
cardiologist Dr. Irvin Depuydt in one week. He is
discharged in stable condition.
