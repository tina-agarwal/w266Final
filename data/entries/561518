Discharge Date: 9/5/1999
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66 year-old male with
known coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction who presented with new onset of dyspnea
on exertion. The cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel
disease and the patient presented for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension , diabetes
mellitus , gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
peripheral vascular disease , and peripheral neuropathy. No
strictures and no bleeding.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg q
day , Imdur 30 mg q day , Aldactone 25 mg
q day , Atenolol 75 mg q day , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. , Zocor 40 mg
q day , insulin 26 units of NPH in the morning , 14 of regular
insulin in the morning , 26 of NPH in the evening and 14 of regular
in the evening.
TESTS/STUDIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left anterior
descending coronary artery with 100 percent
stenosis , left circumflex at the origin with 50 percent stenosis ,
obtuse marginal 100 percent , obtuse marginal two 90 percent , obtuse
marginal three diffuse disease , right coronary artery proximal
30-40 percent , mid 90 percent , ramus 100 percent. Ejection fraction
on echocardiogram was 35 percent , severe apical hypokinesis and
lateral hypokinesis , inferior diskinesis , trace mitral
regurgitation , mild tricuspid regurgitation. Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm with anterior infarct. BUN and
creatinine was 1.9 and 1.6.
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient was awake , alert and oriented times
three. Good oral hygiene. No carotid bruits.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs or gallops.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation to the bases. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender and nondistended , normal active bowel sounds.
Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was informed consented of all the
risks and benefits of the procedure and the
patient was adequate prepared preoperative before the actual
surgery. For more details of the actual surgery please refer to
Dr. Burress ' operative note on 1/28/99 . Immediately postoperatively
the patient was taken to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit
where he was admitted without difficulty. The patient woke up
appropriately and was extubated. The patient had cardiac index of
2.3 , was kept on Neoral and epinephrine for pressor support. The
patient was advancing his diet as tolerated after extubation and
was making adequate urine output. The patient was tolerating wean
from epinephrine on postoperative day number one. The patient
received consultation from the electrophysiology service , as it
appeared that the patient had a transient block at the level of the
AV-node. The patient continued to be followed in the cardiac
surgery intensive care unit and an echocardiogram was done that
showed a 30 percent ejection fraction and global hypokinesis. The
patient had a nonfocal neurological exam. The patient was weaning
down on dopamine and Neoral however still continued to need this
drip. The patient also had a Lasix drip of 10 per hour. The
patient was breathing well on the face mask. The patient was kept
NPO at this time as he was not able to tolerate p.o. intake without
nausea. The patient continued to have an elevated creatinine of
1.7 , down from 1.9 earlier and a hematocrit of 32.8 with no signs
of bleeding. The patient continue to have Ancef for chest tube
coverage.
The patient was again seen by the electrophysiology service for
possible change in his rhythm. The rhythm was Wenckebach and the
patient was evaluated for a possible pacemaker. On postoperative
day number three the patient was hemodynamically stable weaning of
of Neoral but still on Dopamine and still requiring a Lasix drip at
10 per hour. The patient was still in Wenckebach and the patient
continued to breathe well however remained at 70%. The patient
remained NPO as his respiratory needs took precidence over his
eating and the risk of aspiration was high. The patient continued
to make good urine output however was dependent on the Lasix.
Chest tubes were discontinued on this day. The patient was
re-evaluated by the electrophysiology service again. On
postoperative day number four the patient received a pacemaker and
Lasix was discontinued on postoperative day number four. The
pacemaker was placed by Dr. Bruess . For more details of this
surgery please refer to his operative note. A Medtronic lead was
placed.
On postoperative day number five the patient continued to do
extremely well. The patient was AV-paced on the pacemaker at a
rate of 80 with a good blood pressure of 155/70. He weaned down
off of all of his drips and pressure support. The patient was able
to come down to four liters and was able to advance on his diet.
The patient made good urine output with only p.o. Lasix and the
Lasix drip was discontinued. The patient was continued on Kefzol
for perioperative AICD placement and transfer to the floor. On
postoperative day six and seven the patient continued to do
extremely well with no change in his management. The patient
continued on his Lasix , Lopressor and aspirin and Keflex. An
echocardiogram was done that showed an ejection fraction of 30-40
percent. There was no change in his management. The patient
continued to do well advancing in all areas. No instability of his
heart. He advanced to a full house diet making good urine output
with minimal use of Lasix. The patient was therefore discharged
without complications and with placement of the pacemaker on
5/9/99 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day , Colace 100 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
NPH Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneously q a.m. , insulin 10
units regular at night , 7 units of regular twice a day , Niferex 150
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q 4h p.r.n. pain , Zantac
150 mg p.o. twice a day , Coumadin to check with the Coumadin clinic
for strict follow up , potassium slow release 10 mEq p.o. q day and
Zocor 40 mg q night.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient will be discharged to home
with home services to follow up strictly
on his Coumadin dosing. The patient is also to follow up with Dr.
Tommy Dorch in 2-4 weeks and cardiology in one week in the Coumadin
clinic on the next day.
