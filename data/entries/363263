Hospital course:
This is a lovely 79 year-old lady with multiple risk factors for
atheroscosis , including long standing HTN with evidence of LVH on Echo
from 2004 , DM II complicated by neuropathy , hyperlipidemia , and age.
She presented with overt symptoms and clinical signs of congestive heart
failure , including complaints of progressive shortness of breath , PND ,
fatigue , and peripheral edema. Her physical exam was significant for an
elevated JVP , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displaced
PMI , and S3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. Even though the
patient had cardiolmegaly on CXR from 2004 , her LVEF was about 60% ,
suggesting a recent development of CHF. Her EKG showed NSR with new LBBB ,
and no QW. Due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new LBBB ,
and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had a
recent ischemic event. Three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative
during her first 24 hours stay. She had a stress MIBI showing no
scars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated EF of 23%. An
Echo showed dilated LV , with globaly reduced LE function and near normal
pulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. Extensive
interviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies of
HF , TSH and A1C were normal , and and the cause of her dilated CMP
remained undifined. she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57Kg , responded
well to PO Lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with Toprol XL 25mg , and
Spironolactone 12.5mg. Her symptos completely resolved both at rest and
with gentle ambulation. One can argue toward evaluating her coronaray
arteries either by cath or CTA to exclude balanced ischemia. However
considering her age , no changed in EKGs , negative MIBI , and an Echo with
globaly reduced EF , we choose to medicaly treat her. she will be
evaluated in the future for AICD/CRT , then a cath can also be considered.
She will follow up with Dr. Rafael Abeita .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Please go to your primary care within a week to check your potassium
levles.
2. Please avoid salty food ( and don't add to food ).
3. weight yourself twice weekly.
4. Attend your appointment in the cardiology clinic.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Check Chem-7
2. Follow weight.
3. In six months eval for CRT/AICD
