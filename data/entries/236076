Discharge Date: 0/22/2006
ATTENDING: MOLLEKER , LOWELL M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Confusion , mental status change , and hypercarbic respiratory
failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with history of asthma/COPD ,
morbid obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , but does not tolerate
BiPAP who presented to the emergency room with worsening
somnolence. Apparently over the past week the patient has become
progressively more confused and lethargic. At baseline , she is
alert and oriented and walks intermittently with walker ,
although , at most time she is bedbound because of her obesity and
an injured knee at the end of March .  Over the previous week
apparently , the patient had difficulty with her home oxygen
machine and she felt like she "was not getting any air".
Apparently , her son had called the company that supplies the
oxygen. They had come in and said that he should figure out how
to fix it according to him , as she had not been getting oxygen
for the week prior to admission. She had not had any increase in
cough or sputum production. No fever or chills. No chest pain.
No nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. She also had not any change in
her baseline lower extremity swelling/deformity and no increased
erythema or pain in her lower extremities. She has not had any
recent long trips , although she had been somewhat bed bound after
this knee injury. On the day of admission , the patient had
increasing shortness of breath , fatigue , and somnolence and
apparently hallucinations. The Emergency Medical Service was
called and she was unarousable at home and they found her oxygen
sats to be 40%. By the time she in to the ER she was lethargic
and moaning incoherently. Her vitals at that time were
temperature of 97.6 Fahrenheit , blood pressure of 178/46 mmHg ,
heart rate of 106 and regular , breathing 36 times a minute and
satting 90% on 100% nonrebreather. Her fingerstick at that time
was 220. Her trachea was intubated and she was given Fentanyl ,
Valium , albuterol , and Atrovent nebs and Solu-Medrol in the
emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , severe left ventricular
hypertrophy , asthma/COPD without known pulmonary function testing
in the past , morbid obesity weighing approximately 460 pounds ,
obstructive sleep apnea - she could not tolerate CPAP in the
past , osteoarthritis , and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as a
distant history of pulmonary embolus. After having a total
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in
1/29 , she was anticoagulated for several months , but not since
then.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth each day , furosemide 40 mg by mouth
each day , glyburide 5 mg by mouth each day , albuterol inhalers ,
Motrin 600 mg by mouth each day , and metoprolol 25 mg by mouth 3
times a day , and she is also on 3L nasal cannula home oxygen 24
hours a day.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is a former bus driver. She lives at home with her son ,
Troisi who is 30 years old , has a visiting nurse. No tobacco or
alcohol or illicit drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Her temperature was 97.6 degree Fahrenheit , her heart rate was
106 and regular , her blood pressure was 130/50 , respiratory rate
of 24 , and oxygen saturation 98%. At that point , she was
intubated. She opened her eyes to sternal rub but not to voice.
Her pupils were equal and 2 mm bilaterally. Her neck was supple.
Pulmonary: Sounds were coarse anterior and laterally.
Cardiovascular: She had distant , distant heart sounds ,
tachycardic. Her jugular venous pressure was unable to be
assessed given her neck size and her distal , radial , and dorsalis
pedis pulses were all palpable 1+. Abdomen is obese. Bowel
sounds were present , soft , nontender , and nondistended. She had
a midline scar. Extremities were cool with chronic venostasis
changes perhaps lymphedema changes bilaterally. Left lower
extremity was 23 inches and right lower extremity was 18 inches
at the calf. Neurologic: As stated , she opens her eyes to
sternal rub at that time.
LABS ON ADMISSION:
She had a sodium of 144 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 95 , bicarbonate
of 40 , BUN of 16 , creatinine of 0.7 , and glucose of 236. Calcium
of 8.9 , magnesium of 1.9 , phosphorous of 4.7 , ALT of 23 , AST of
18 , total bilirubin of 2.1 , alkaline phosphatase of 78 , and
albumin of 3.9. Urinalysis was significant for 3+ protein , 2+
blood , positive leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , and
bacteria as well as trichomonas. Her D-dimer was 1330. Her
white count was 13 , 000 with 90% neutrophils , 2% bands , and 5%
lymphocytes. Her hematocrit was 42.4% and platelet count was
164 , 000. Her MCV was 93 and she had an anti-PF4 antibody , also
known as a HIT antibody , which was negative. Her INR was 1.2 and
her PTT was 26.3. Her urine and serum tox screens did not reveal
any toxins. Her chest radiograph was a poor quality film given
the girth. The film was rotated. The ET tube was 3.5 cm from
the corner , otherwise , extraordinarily limited , but no gross
consolidation or effusions were noted. A pulmonary embolus CT
scan or V/Q scan were considered to rule out a pulmonary embolus;
however , the patient's abdominal girth prevented either of these
studies from being done. Lower extremity noninvasive studies
were performed , which did not show any clot although this was
also limited by her chronic lower extremity changes. Urine
culture and blood cultures were sent on 9/11/06 .  The urine
culture grew mixed flora and the blood cultures have been
negative to date.
ASSESSMENT AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
This is a 54-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease on home oxygen as well as obstructive sleep apnea ,
hypertension , and left ventricular hypertrophy and obesity with
mental status changes and respiratory changes consistent with an
exacerbation of recurrent obstructive pulmonary disease and
hypoxemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary: Her trachea was extubated within several hours of
coming to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. At first , she was
doing quite well on BiPAP at 25 and 5; however , she became a bit
more somnolent and the decision was made to intubate her trachea
once again within several hours. An ABG at that time was done ,
which revealed an arterial blood gas at that time with an FiO2 of
60% revealed a pH of 7.19 , a CO2 of 119 , and an oxygen of 106
with saturation of 97%. As we were preparing to intubate the
trachea , the patient became more alert and requested to speak to
her son beforehand and saying she did not want to have the tube
down her throat. Her son came in and she continued making more
sense and asking us not to intubate her trachea. The decision
was made to observe her with the BiPAP , which was done. Within
several hours her carbon dioxide had decreased to 103 and then by
3 hours after that it actually decreased to 80. Her arterial
blood gas at that time showed pH of 7.32 with a PCO2 of 80 , a PO2
of 71 on 2L of actual nasal cannula and then O2 saturation of
95%. She remained on BiPAP intermittently at various setting.
Her final settings were pressure support of 20 and a PEEP of 5.
Her CO2 ranged from the mid 60s to 99 without a very clear
correlation between her mental status and her CO2s. The thought
was that her baseline CO2 was probably somewhere in the 70s given
that her pH was normal with PCO2 around in the low 80s. It was
thought that she is a chronic carbon dioxide retainer. Her
bicarbonates on admission here previously had been in the mid to
high 30s and low 40s just as they were during this admission and
that she just had an acute hypercarbic event. Throughout her
stay she has had episodes where she become slightly less
responsive always will awake with appropriate physical stimuli
and will give appropriate responses. She was treated for her
pulmonary disease initially with corticosteroids , which were
discontinued given that we did not feel that she had large a
inflammatory component to this , Levofloxacin 500 mg a day ,
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and she was started on an
inhaled corticosteroid.
2. Vascular: The possibility of a pulmonary embolus was
considered especially given her history of pulmonary embolus in
the past. Unfortunately , diagnostic imaging was inadequate given
her girth and lower extremity issues. There is discussion of
putting her on chronic anticoagulation for the possibility of
pulmonary embolus; however , we felt she had a low to moderate
probability of pulmonary embolus and that the risks of long-term
anticoagulation outweigh the benefits given that she probably did
not have a pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis. This was
discussed with the patient and she agreed with that decision.
This can be readdressed in the future. The decision was also
centered around the fact that her previous pulmonary embolus was
in the setting of pelvic surgery and likely did not reflex any
increased likelihood of thrombosis. However , she should be
continued on subcutaneous enoxaparin or other prophylaxis for
deep venous thrombosis while she is bedbound.
3. Cardiac: The patient has a history of hypertension and left
ventricular hypertrophy. She should be continued on
enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg a day , lisinopril 40 mg a day , and
she will discharged on atenolol 25 mg per day.
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was
managed in the hospital on a low dose of insulin NPH and Aspart
sliding scale. On discharge , she will be resumed on her home
dose of sulfonylurea. It may be considered that she will be good
candidate for metformin given her weight and likely poor control
of her diabetes.
5. Obstructive sleep apnea with known elevated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure at approximately 90+ right atrium and
echocardiogram during her last admission at Mertaymonpeters Medical Center .  The patient should be counseled and encouraged to use
her BiPAP or CPAP machine at home all the time at night given her
likely severe obstructive sleep apnea and known vascular effects
of that.
MEDICATION ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth each day.
2. Atenolol 25 mg by mouth each day.
3. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg by mouth each day.
4. Enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneous each day.
5. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers every 4 hours and p.r.n.
wheezing or shortness of breath , this may be changed to inhalers
when the patient can tolerate and she should be educated on that.
6. Flovent.
7. Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth each day for 5 more days.
8. Flagyl 500 mg by mouth twice a day for 11 more days for
treatment of trichomonas.
9. Glyburide 5 mg by mouth once daily.
10. Regular insulin sliding scale as determined by the doctor at
rehabilitation with meals.
11. BiPAP 20 for pressure support and 5 of PEEP every night all ,
night and during the day as required. It would be recommended
that she was on BiPAP continuously for at least 48 hours after
discharge as tolerated by the patient except to speak with her
family.
