accompanied by nausea and vomiting and some diaphoresis. It was
relieved in the ED by two sublingual nitroglycerins. She had
negative cardiac enzymes x 2 and was admitted for a workup.

evidence of any infection and no carotid bruits. Chest: No
incision. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Pulses 2+
in carotids , radials , and femorals bilaterally. Dorsalis pedis
1+ bilaterally , posterior tibial nonpalpable but dopplerable on

??___?? ST elevation ??____?? Moderate LV function was noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
??___?? within normal limits so vascular causes of pain in the
right lower extremity was ruled out and they recommended leg
elevation as part of the treatment so Orthopedics was consulted
to delineate the reason for the excruciating right lower
extremity pain which is still pending.
Cardiovascular: She is on Lopressor and captopril , and the
patient apparently had an inferior wall MI postop. Reason seems
to be poor targets , CPK and MBs were cycled continuously for
three more days in the ICU. The MBs finally started trending
down on day #3 with a peak of 140. The CPKs started trending
down along with the MB as high as 2600 , but on day #5 the CK
started rising again to touch a high level of 5000 which was
being worked up at the time of transfer. Otherwise , she is on
captopril , Lopressor , and doxycycline. Interventional Cardiology
is following her and recommended heparin for a possible

course of the ICU stay. No active issues at the time of
transfer.
ID: She was started on levofloxacin , and she was also started on
vancomycin for a possible urine infection and that has to be
