DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE: 1. CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES
MELLITUS.
4. PNEUMONIA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year old woman
with a history of chronic atrial
fibrillation who was admitted with fever , rapid atrial
fibrillation , shortness of breath , and chest pain. She has had
atrial fibrillation for one and a half years and she had been rate
controlled with Digoxin , Lopressor , and Diltiazem in the past. She
had been poorly compliant with her medications. In 6/25 , she had
a MIBI which was negative for reversible perfusion defect and in
1/5 , she had an echo that showed normal left ventricular size and
left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with a large left
atrium. She had moderate distal hypokinesis and trace tricuspid
regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. In 0/17 , she had a Holter
that showed atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter at a rate of 70 to
185. In 1/29 , she was admitted to Chokern Hospital
with substernal chest pain and increasing shortness of breath. A
chest X-Ray at this time showed pulmonary edema. She was treated
with intravenous Lopressor and Lasix and ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. One day prior to admission , the patient noted the
onset of increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. She had a
cough productive of yellow sputum. She was seen in the Emergency
Room and at that time , was afebrile with an O2 saturation of 93% on
room air. She was in atrial fibrillation at 100 and her
laboratories were within normal limits. She was discharged to
home. She returned to the Emergency Ward several hours later with
persistent shortness of breath now complaining of substernal chest
pain. She did have a temperature of 101 at this point and she was
admitted for further evaluation. She was given Lasix 20 mg
intravenously in the Emergency Room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1 ) Chronic atrial
fibrillation. 2 ) Hypertension. 3 )
Non-Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 4 ) Diverticulitis status
post sigmoid colectomy. 5 ) Status post ventral hernia repair. 6 )
Status post right carpal-tunnel release.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 2.5 mg , Restoril p.r.n. , Atenolol 50
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
sublingual Nitroglycerin p.r.n. , and Digoxin. She does not smoke
or drink any alcohol.
ALLERGIES: She is allergic to Penicillin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a Hispanic woman in no apparent
distress. Her temperature was 101.6 , blood
pressure 122/70 , heart rate 110 , she was saturating 99% on two
liters. HEENT: Examination was within normal limits. NECK:
Supple with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention.
CHEST: Showed diffuse expiratory wheezes with crackles at the left
base. CARDIAC: Examination showed an S1 and S2 with an irregular
heartbeat , there were no murmurs , and her carotids were 2+ without
bruits. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and non-distended.
EXTREMITIES: Showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest X-Ray showed pulmonary edema with
question of an infiltrate at the left base
in addition. EKG showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 111 and
she had no T wave or ST segment changes. Her SMA 7 was within
normal limits , her white blood cell count was 8.7 , her hematocrit
was 42 , her platelets were 201 , her liver function tests were
within normal limits , her INR on admission was 1.7 , and her digoxin
level was 0.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for possible pneumonia
and rule out myocardial infarction as well as
congestive heart failure. She was started on Cefotaxime
intravenously and put on nebulized inhalers. All cultures , blood
and sputum cultures , were negative and her chest X-Ray the next day
was clear suggesting that the patient most likely had a
tracheobronchitis rather than an actual pneumonia. From a cardiac
standpoint , she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction
protocol. She ruled out , she was given increased diuresis , and her
rales and wheezes improved. Over the next several days , she did
well , however , she did have still some evidence of congestive heart
failure on examination. An echo was obtained which showed an
ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with normal left ventricular size.
The patient was therefore changed from Digoxin to Diltiazem 60
t.i.d. for her rate control for atrial fibrillation. Her Lasix
dose was also increased to 40 mg p.o. q.d. The Atenolol was
discontinued. The patient did very well on this regimen. She had
no further evidence of rales or wheezing and her congestive heart
failure seemed to be in much better control. Her heart rate was
well controlled on the Diltiazem at a rate of 60 to 70 with blood
pressures of 120/70. Her initial complaints of cough also
resolved. She was changed to p.o. antibiotics and was sent home to
complete a ten day course for presumed pneumonia.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged in good condition on
0/13/95 . She is to follow-up with Dr. Cuzzi , her
primary medical doctor , on Monday , 6/6/95 at his walk-in clinic.
DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Beclovent four puffs inhaled
b.i.d. , Cephradine 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for five days , Diltiazem 60
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Robitussin cough medicine
p.r.n. , Atrovent Inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. , and Coumadin 2.5
mg p.o. q.d.
