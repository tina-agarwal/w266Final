Discharge Date: 5/2/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old gentleman with a
history of chest pain and atrial
fibrillation. His cardiac risk factors included hypertension ,
cigarette smoking and a family history; no diabetes or cholesterol.
In 11/27 , he sustained an IMI complicated by V-tach , cardiogenic
shock and Dresler's. He was discharged on digoxin and Lasix. He
subsequently did well with chest pain only on extreme exertion
characterized by retrosternal burning which radiated to his left
arm with shortness of breath. It did not occur at rest. He saw
Dr. Luthi who prescribed Isordil with much decrement in symptoms.
In 0/4 , he was found to be hypertensive with decrease in T-4. He
was treated with captopril and Synthroid. In 7/24 , he had new
onset of atrial fibrillation. He was treated with Quinaglute. In
1/21 , he noted dizziness with decreased vision episodically. He
was treated with the discontinuation of captopril and digoxin was
begun. Atrial fibrillation was again documented on a Holter.
On 8/25/90 , he was admitted to Onlanfalls Health with atrial
fibrillation. The quinidine level was 1.6 and digoxin level 0.8 ,
T-4 9.2. The heart rate was 64 , blood pressure 110/90. He ruled
out for an MI. He was treated with an increase in his quinidine
sulfate. His course was complicated by a five second pause. A DDD
pacer was placed. He continued to have light-headedness without
associated arrhythmias. An echo revealed an ejection fraction of
30% with inferior akinesis , left ventricular hypertrophy and a
small pericardial effusion. While in the hospital , he had two
episodes of chest pain which were abated by nitroglycerin. There
were no brady or tachy arrhythmias noted at the times of the chest
pain. He was off Isordil. The chest pain occurred with walking.
There was no chest pain since restarting Isordil. On the monitor
he was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm with a first degree heart
block and occasional atrial fibrillation. The T-4 value was 9.2.
PAST HISTORY: Cholecystectomy in 1983; hypertension; decreased
T-4; meningitis as a child. ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Heart rate 65; blood pressure 120/90;
temperature 97.5. The HEENT exam was
unremarkable. Carotids 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.
The lungs were clear. The cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and
rhythm; S1 and S2; no S3; II/VI systolic murmur at the left upper
sternal border radiating to the apex; no rubs; PMI nondisplaced;
JVD 6 cm. The abdomen revealed a cholecystectomy scar. The
extremities revealed strong pulses and no bruits. The neuro exam
was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: White count 9.4; hematocrit 42;
platelets 390; sodium 143; potassium 5.2;
chloride 107; CO2 30; BUN 26; creatinine 1.8; glucose 90; PT 12.6;
PTT 29.8; quinidine level 3; calcium 9.2. The EKG revealed dual
chamber 100% paced; no atrial activity; rate 65; intervals 0.16 ,
0.20 and 0.50. An EKG from 2/14 revealed sinus brady at 50;
intervals 0.22 , 0.12; appropriate QTC; left atrial hypertrophy.
Urinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.025 , pH 5 ,
presence of urate crystals. The chest x-ray showed no CHF or
infiltrate; cardiomegaly as well as a dual chamber pacer present.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the cardiology Hass
team. The Metteand Health Center team preferred to stop the
Quinidex at this time and observe him for recurrence of atrial
fibrillation with plans to start Norpace if this occurred. There
was no recurrence of atrial fibrillation while in-house. The DDD
remained in place with settings as per the admission note. He had
a cardiac work up consisting of an echocardiogram revealing an
ejection fraction of 30% with inferior and apical hypokinesis
consistent with location of the old MI. He was maintained on
Isordil and atenolol as part of his admission regimen without
symptoms while in-house. On the prior to discharge , he underwent a
standard Bruce ETT. He exercised nine minutes stopping secondary
to fatigue with a peak heart rate of 105; blood pressure increased
from 100/80 to 124/78. There were no ST-T wave changes from
baseline. He was thought to be maximally medicated. His pulse
pressure product at rest was excellent and well maintained , and he
was asymptomatic. He was maintained on his current cardiac
regimen.
He was noted to have a mildly elevated BUN at 26 and creatinine 1.8
on admission. He was found to have urate crystals in his urine.
His BUN decreased to 23 and creatinine 1.3 prior to discharge. We
will consider alkalyzing his urine if we suspect a true urate
nephropathy.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged to home on 8/26/90 . MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; atenolol 50 mg
p.o. b.i.d.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. ASYSTOLE.
4. QUESTION OF URIC ACID NEPHROPATHY.
