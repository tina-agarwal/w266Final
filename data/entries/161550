CC: Chest Pain
History of Present Illness
Ms. Webre is a 75F who began HD one month ago , and presented 10 days
PTA with an NSTEMI ( Troponin 2.9 ) ( 70% LAD lesion which is s/p DES ). She
presents again with epigastric and sub-sternal burning sensation which
is similar , but more intense , to her anginal pain 10 days ago. Episodes
started 2 days prior to admission , occurring when lying down to go to
bed and last 1 hour ( spontaneously resolved , about a 2-3/10 ). Second
identical episode 1 day PTA. Neither associated with radiating pain ,
exertion , or DOE. Then had an episode while walking to PCPs office ,
associated with dyspnea and relieved with rest. Sent to ED , where
another episode occurred and was relieved with nitro. Received BB and
ASA in ED. Pt denies missing any plavix since DES placement , although
she does state plavix has caused her to have diarrhea. She denies any
radiating chest pain , F/C , weight change. + cough since starting
lisinopril , orthopnea ( unchanged from baseline ).

HOSPITAL COURSE
The patient was admitted to cardiac telemetry for atypical chest pain in
the setting of an NSTEMI and stent placement one week prior to this
admission. The pt reports having taken her plavix regularly , and having
not missed a single dose. She had no EKG changes , but did have burning
substernal chest pain at rest while lying down. Her cardiac enzymes
were flat ( troponin 0.21-0.23 in the setting of renal failure/HD ). This
pain was relieved by nitro SL. She was taken to cardiac catheterization
for further evaluation of her recent stent. No critical obstructions were
seen and the stent was widely patent. Her pain was relieved with PPI , and
she is discharged with a diagnosis of GERD. This pain is not felt to be
cardiac in origin.
