BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: hypotension at home
*****************
HPI: 67M w/recent FH admit for fluid overload in the setting of chronic
kidney disease and dietary salt load. He was sent home on higher doses
of his BP meds as well as the addition of HCTZ to his home lasix dose.
He was also sent home on a 10 day course of cipro for a foley-associated
UTI. He did well until the day of admission when he felt tired , checked
his BP himself at home and found it was 86/41 , so he called his doctor
who directed him the the ER. He denies SOB , COP , orthopnea , PND , N/V ,
abdominal pain , or cough. He has had loose stools x 3 days which he
believes is because the VNA increased his stool softeners. In the ED his
BP was 91/60 with a pulse of 60 and he got 1L fluid.

********************
IMPRESSION: 68M with fluid-reponsive hypotension in setting of recent
aggressive diuresis and blood pressure medicine augmentation.
1 ) CV( p ): Mr. Axtell was felt to be hypotensive from being dry in the
setting of overdiuresis and increased stool output. His BP was fluid
responsive to 1L in the ED , after which he was able to maintain oral
hydration. His diuretics were held during his hospital stay and his
lasix will need to be resumed once he begins to put on water weight ( he
may not need the HCTZ , as the synergy of the two diuretics appears to
have been too much for him ). His ARB was held in the setting of his
acute on chronic renal failure and will also need to be resumed once his
creatinine improves to his baseline. His labetalol dose was also reduced
to allow him to mount a heart rate response to hypotension. His
nifedipine dose stayed the same. He was tolerating a regimen of
labetalol 100mg PO twice a day and nifedipine 120mg PO once a day on
discharge , with systolic blood pressures in the 120-130s.
2 ) RENAL: as noted above , the patient appeared to be in acute on
chronic renal failure from overdiuresis. He continued to make good
urine output ( 1-2L per day ) and his creatinine trended downward. His
ARB was held but will need to be restarted as an outpatient.
3 ) DM: he was maintained on his home regimen of lantus 48 , aspartate qac
and slide scale. He was on a renal , cardiac , diabetic diet.

2 ) Mr. Pocasangre : your labetalol is now 100mg twice a day ( was 200mg twice a
day ).
3 ) VNA: please check Mr. Outhouse blood pressure , heart rate , and weight
twice a week and call or fax results to PCP.
