PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well developed , well nourished female in no

without crackles. Heart: Mechanical S1 and normal S2. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , nondistended. Bowel sounds positive. 2+ edema to

refill.
LABORATORY DATA: ECG was significant for normal rate , atrial
fibrillation rhythm. No acute ST-T wave changes.
The patient had Q-waves in leads 3 and aVF. The patient's x-ray
was consistent with pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The cardiology service was consulted with the
recommendations that the patient be diuresed
aggressively , daily weights and ins-and-outs be followed , and fluid
and sodium restriction to patient. The patient was placed on
heparin preoperatively.
On hospital day #2 preoperatively , the patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit after she experienced a hypotensive
event with systolic blood pressure in the 50s with associated
drowsiness while maintaining her own airway. The feeling was that
the patient's event was likely secondary to the initiation of
Verapamil for rate control of her atrial fibrillation. The rate
control was then continued with Lopressor and Verapamil was held.
Goal potassium greater than 3.5 and magnesium greater than 2 were
maintained. The patient's diuresis was continued. The patient was
felt to be stable for surgery.
On hospital day #3 , 2/3/98 , the patient was brought to the
operating room for sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis , as
well as drainage of abscess. Postoperatively , the patient was
transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring of her cardiopulmonary issues. Postoperatively , the
patient progressed well. She was maintained on perioperative
Vancomycin , Levofloxacin , and Flagyl. Cardiovascularly , she was
maintained on Lopressor , Nitropaste , Hydralazine , and Digoxin for
her atrial flutter. The patient did well on the floor , tolerating
IV to p.o. pain control , reinstitution of Coumadin for
anticoagulation , tolerating regular activity. Of note ,
the patient completed a rule out for myocardial infarction by
serial enzymes and ECGs. The patient was seen by the physical
therapy service and noted to have progressively improving activity.
The patient was discharged in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to the Chemu Ford11 Memorial ,
a rehabilitation hospital. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:

on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday. She has a goal INR of 3.0. The
patient is not being discharged on Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d. because
she has had consistently low blood sugars. Fingerstick blood
glucose should be checked b.i.d. with resumption of Glyburide when
