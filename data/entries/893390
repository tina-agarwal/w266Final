Discharge Date: 8/27/2005
ATTENDING: FREDERICK GOLICK MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Left hip infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 60-year-old female who sustained a mechanical fall out
of bed on 8/21/04 and suffered a left subtrochanteric fracture
for which she underwent left intramedullary nailing at Rush-j Hospital by Dr. Hipolito Soderquist . Some weeks later ,
she returned with a left hip infection with drainage noted from
her wound. An irrigation and debridement was performed at an
outside hospital where concern for sepsis had developed in the
context of hypotension. Cultures from this procedure grew out
Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. She was transferred
to the Lomorerey Tonlarg Hospitals for further management; and
on 11/28/05 , another irrigation and debridement was performed by
Dr. Matula . Vancomycin and rifampin were begun at this time.
She was discharged to rehabilitation , had convalesced , and
returned home. Not four days later , she was found on follow up
to have continued drainage from the wound and increased pain in
her left hip. She was admitted for treatment of continued left
hip infection. The patient arrived with a PICC line in place on
vancomycin for MRSA infection.

ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
Afebrile , heart rate stable , serosanguineous drainage from left
hip wound , range of motion decreased secondary to pain. Left
lower extremity warm and well perfused. Sensation intact to
light touch in all distributions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitting from clinic for further evaluation and
management of the suspected left hip infection. A CT scan was
performed which revealed a 12 cm x 7 cm x 4.5 cm fluid collection
lateral to the hip extending into the surrounding soft tissues
with question of contiguity with the nail/intramedullary space.
Given the patient's history with general anesthesia including
desaturations and difficulty with ventilation experienced on
irrigation and debridement in May 2004 management aims were
directed towards the conservative if at all possible. YR
Radiology was consulted for potential IR drainage of the
collection and anesthesiology was consulted of her previous
events under sedation. On 10/10/05 , the patient underwent a
CT-guided drainage of fluid collection with placement of a
drainage catheter. A 10 cc of pus was immediately aspirated upon
introduction of the guiding needle. A gram stain revealed 4+
PMNs and no growth on aerobic or anaerobic cultures. Blood
cultures drawn the following day also showed no growth. The
Infectious Disease Service continued to follow the patient in
house with recommendations to continue vancomycin without
rifampin that had been suggested upon previous discharge and
despite her itchiness with infusions since no other signs of
symptoms of allergic or anaphylactic reaction had occurred. Her
vancomycin regimen was changed to 1000 mg IV q.12h. and slightly
higher trough levels were tolerated by the ID Service due to the
patient's renal function and the persistence of the patient's
infection. Continued monitoring of vancomycin levels were
therefore not recommended.
Due to continued drainage from the catheterized wound , the
decision was made for treatment of the hip by a multistage
procedure , in which the hardware would be removed and antibiotics
spacer placed temporarily while longterm IV antibiotic treatment
was pursued for at least six weeks and finally the hip replaced
with total arthroplasty , once evidence suggested that infection
had been cleared.
On 10/0/05 , the patient underwent removal of the intramedullary
nail , Girdlestone procedure , and placement of antibiotic beads.
Please see the operative note for further details. The procedure
proceeded without complication including any anesthetic events as
had occurred in the past. She was transfused 2 units of packed
red blood cells due to a postoperative hematocrit of 24
experiencing an appropriate rise following transfusion. Gram
stain from intramedullary reamings showed 2+ polys with no
organisms and cultures revealed no growth. She described minimal
pain and was able to weightbear as tolerated on the left lower
extremity without difficulty. A urinary tract infection was
found on preoperative evaluation for the second stage operation
and she was treated with a seven-day course of levofloxacin.
On 8/23/05 , the patient returned to the OR for removal of
antibiotic beads and placement of an antibiotic spacer , please
see the operative note for further details. This too proceeded
without intraoperative complications , however , postoperatively ,
it was found that the spacer head was slightly dislocated. This
was tolerated and the patient was allowed to weightbear. She did
this minimally secondary to increased pain. She was also again
transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a
hematocrit of 24 with an appropriate rise in her hematocrit
falling. Given the increased pain , the obvious shortening of the
leg with external rotation and without neurovascular compromise
the patient was counseled that operative exploration and
replacement of the spacer would be recommended. While the
patient did understand the need for this , she became more
depressed at the prospect of what described a "set back."
Psychiatry was consulted for support and potential change in
medications if they deemed fit. They did not recommend any
changes in her current antidepressant regimen but did suggest
continued support by social work. This was indeed the case.
By 1/29/05 , the patient was at the peace with the decision for
further surgery and she returned to the OR. Please see the
operative note for further details. The patient underwent a left
antibiotic space replacement with fusion of the head in the
socket. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Her
postoperative course was unremarkable. She did complain of some
pain with movement of her left hip but this was to be expected
given the fusion of the spacer head with the socket and this pain
did improve with time. She also noted some difficulty with
ambulation given her shorter left leg , a left leg lift was
therefore provided to her. By the time of discharge , she was
voiding , tolerating regular diet , and ambulating with assistance.
Physical therapy did work with her for weightbearing as
tolerated on the left lower extremity with posterior precautions.
She was discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation
facility for further subacute care and with instructions to
continue IV vancomycin for another six weeks ( starting date
8/5/05 ). She was also instructed to follow up with Dr. Muma
in one to two weeks. The patient will followed by the Infectious
Disease Service when she returns in house and the service is
reconsulted at that time.
The patient arrived on the prednisone taper which was eventually
discontinued per patient wishes and agreement with her
rheumatologist , her last dose was on 3/28/05 and she will not
continue with prednisone thereafter.
