HOSPITAL COURSE: 68F w/ a hx of HTN , CRI , obesity , psoriasis presenting
w/ RLE ulcer and cellulitis. Hospital course complicated by episodes of
sinus brady to 30's w/ 4-6 sec pauses , asx , evaluated by EP , no need for
PPM at present.
**
1 ) R lower ext Ulcer and cellulitis - cellulitis initially treated with
nafcillin IV for 5 days with improvement in both swelling , erythema , and
pain. Discharge from the wound was cultured and grew out Ecoli and
Enterobacter , sensitive to cipro. Abx were switched to cipro which would
provide coverage for the gram negatives growing from her wound and also
cover her cellulitis. She will complete a total abx course of 12 days
( additional 5 days of cipro ). There was an initial concern for DVT but
LENIS were negative. Zinc and Vit C were added to her regimen. She will
also need Wound changes with NS wet to dry BID. The ulcer is most likely
due to poor wound healing in the setting of chronic venous stasis. It was
also noted that she had very weak LE pulse so vascualar surgery was
consulted. She was found to have + peripheral pulses by doppler , and
follow up with vascular surgery was set up for her. She will also get
umaboots and ABI at her followup.
***
2 ) bradycardia: to 30's during sleep. Pt came in on atenolol which we
discontinued , esecially in the setting of CRI. No tachyarrythmia on Tele.
Good HR response w/ actviity up to 70s. Evaluated by EP and felt that
she was not a candidate for a PPM at this point , especially since her
bradycardia is assymptomatic. It was felt that her bradycardia is most
likely due to her OSA , and that she would benefit from a sleep study. If
her bradycardia does not improve after treatment of her OSA , then she
will need to follow up with EP for further evaluation.
***
3 ) ENdo - fasting glucose normal , HGA1C -5.4.
***
4 ) Renal - CRI at baseline. No issues during hospitalization
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. take antibiotics for full course , if ulcer or cellulitis worsens or
does not improve after antibiotics please call your doctor
2. stop taking atenolol
3. New medications: cipro , ascorbic acid ( vit C ) , zinc
4. Follow up with PCP
5. Appt for sleep study ( sleep clinic will call with your scheduled
appt. )
6. Wound care: BID wet to dry dressing changes with NS
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. d/c atenolol , avouid nodal blocking agents
2. sleep study - clinic will call patient with appt date
3. if there is no improvement of bradycardia after tx for OSA , follow up
with EP.
4. Complete abx course ( 5 more days of cipro )
5. vascular surgery appt with Dr. Gleeson
No dictated summary
