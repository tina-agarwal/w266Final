BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Chest pain and pressure x 3 days
********************
HPI: 61y.o. M w/ CAD , s/p MI w/ 4 vessel CABG w/ onset of sx of SS
chest pain and pressure 3 days ago. Pain waxes and wanes , intense
periods lasting 5-15 minutes , variant interludes between episodes ,
the shortest being one hour. radiates to his stomach , but not
arm , back or jaw. Endorses diaphoresis , SOB , lightheadeness , blurry
vision , HA. These symptoms subside w/o
pain. Denies F/C/N/V. Denies trouble speaking , presyncope
w/ pain. Denies recent sick contacts , recent travel. He endorses a
dry , scratchy throat last week. Denies reflux or GERD.
He is not on plavix , coumadin or ASA at home. He has not yet followed
up w/ A cardiologist since his surgery.
s/p MI and 4 vessel CABG at CEMC w/ harvest of the L saphenous vein
and L cephalic Vein ( assumed since harevst sites are in distal ULE ,
and LLE ). 1x episode of frank hematuria and UTI at RHA and was
started on Bactrim. No problems since and denies fruther heamturia at
home. He was d/c'd November and returned to T Gilbkane S July
In the ED , the patient was given ASA 325mg , Nitroglycerin x3 w/ good
effect , lopressor 25mg , morphine 2mg.

Daily Status:
*************
STUDIES:
January EKG at 12pm w/ 1-2 mm ST elevations in V1-V3 , T wave
inversions in V4-V6 and aVL ,
January EKG at 5pm as above but w/ new T wave inversions in V3
January CXR: moderate left-sided pleural effusion with associated
sub-segmental atelectasis , small right posterior pleural effusion
**************
Hospital course: 61y.o M w/ CAD , s/p MI w/ 4 vessel CABG who presented
presenting with CP and pressure , lightheadedness and SOB x 3days. Sx c/w
unstable angina vs. coronary vasospasm vs. incisional/pleuritic pain s/p
CABG.
--CV: Patient admitted w/ sx of SOB , SSCP and pressure , diaphoresis ,
lightheadedness that lasted 5-15 minutes per episode , did not radiate
other than to abdomen , very concerning for ACS vs. unstable angina ,
especially in the setting of known CAD and recent 4-vessel CABG ( SH : BCH
-&gt; 1st diagonal and then to LAD , L radial artery anastomosis to distal
RCA , L saphenous vein to left circumflex first major marginal; post
surgery SSUH echo w/ EF of 43% and some basilar hypokinesis , patient
started on amiodarone for bigeminy ). Dressler's less likely at this time
out from post-op.
( I ) In the ED , the EKG on admission showed NSR , 1-2 mm ST elevations in
leads V1-V3 , T wave inversions in V4-V6 , concerning for acute cardiac
process. No comparison EKG for baseline so unable to ascertain if new
ischemia or if ACS in setting of sx. Patient rec'd ASA , nitro x3 w/
relief and 2 mg morphine in ED. CXR was performed showing bilateral
effusions w/ L&gt;R. Enzyme set A was negative. Patient was admitted to
floor , where a repeat EKG was done , which showed changes from his prior
EKG , specifically a new T wave inversion in V3 and trigeminy with PVCs.
Patient reported mild pain at this time. Signs &amp; symptoms were
concerning enough for ACS that the patient was started on a heparin drip
of 1000cc/hr with a loading bolus of 5000 units and his PTT followed.
Home isosorbide was held to ascertain for pain. Records were requested
from Wickstra Hospital , where the patient had his surgery 1 month ago.
Patient was put on telemetry and his home Lipitor was increased to 80
mg , and his home lopressor was increased to 37.5 mg TID. Overnight he was
pain free , and r/o'd by enzymes x 3. His telemetry showed NSR w/
occasional trigeminy and PVCs. Pain may be incisional or anginal ,
lightheadedness most likely patient's anginal equivalent. Cardiology was
consulted to consider the indications for catheterization and risk of ACS.
The patient was asx 5/16 and noted to have some sternal incisional pain
with palpation , no EKG changes observed. Reccomendations were made to send
the patient to ETT-MIBI 9/11 , check fasting am lipids , d/c home amiodarone
from RH for his ? arrythmia. The patient was also started on Lisinopril
5mg at this time and his heparin drip was d/c'd. ETT-MIBI showed no signs
of reversible ischemia , basal wall hypokinesis but which was knwon on
admission. Fasting cholesterol was unable to be sent 2/2 to am MIBI
schedule. Should be tested as outpatient.
( P ): No signs of pump dysfunction though mildly elevated jvp of 6-8cm on
admission , EF post-CABG at LMVH was 43%. Repeat echo was ordered to assess
function though cancelled in setting of unremarkable MIBI and absence of of
sx and signs failure while in house.
( R ): Alternates between NSR and trigeminy with PVCs. Amiodarone from TH
d/c's as not needed for this rhythym.
--Renal: h/o hematuria at MMH , microhematuria on U/A and urine sed on
admission. Will require outpatient follow up. Per LAH noted he would need
renal bx and follow-up though it does not seem appropriate w/ h/o foley and
hematuria. Cystoscopy seems more relevant. We consulted the patient's PCP
and agree to recommend outpatient urology follow-up over renal. Urine
cytology was ordered and collected ( though some lost to collection during
MIBI ). Can be followed as outpatient.
--Pulm: cxr w/ bilateral effusions L&gt;R but which are consistent with a
setting of recent cardiac surgery. Patient noted + SOB w/ pain. PE
unlikely as infection. Exam resolved slightly over course of stay.
PPx: Pt on heparin drip w/ ? of ACS on 6/9 , lovenox held. Haprin d/c'd 5/16
in pm. Lovenox held as patient ambulatory and to home on 3/13

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: -Please follow-up with Cardiology , Dr. Varvil
-Please cancel renal follow up and renal biopsy with Dr. Compston
-Please follow-up with Dr. Rensch , Urology for hematuria
-Please stop taking Motrin for back pain since it can be dangerous if you
have heart problems
-Please take Tylenol for pain instead
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please follow up urine cytology
Please check fasting lipids
