Discharge Date: 1/17/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY WOUND INFECTION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54 year old gentleman
who is status post a four vessel
coronary artery bypass graft on 6/17/95 at an outside hospital.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by respiratory
failure secondary to presumed phrenic nerve injury. The patient
also developed congestive heart failure. In addition , the patient
had undergone embolectomy and left lower extremity fasciotomy for
left lower extremity ischemia on 11/27/95 . The patient now presents
to Dr. Jaysura with infected left lower leg pressure ulcer with
open and gangrenous muscle exposed through this posterior wound.
The patient was at the rehabilitation center prior to this transfer
to the Wickpro Conch Medical Center .  The patient had no documented
febrile episodes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular
disease , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , history
of atrial fibrillation/flutter , right sacroiliac joint decubitus
ulcer.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery bypass graft
on 0/13/95 . Left lower extremity
fasciotomy on 11/27/95 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 81 mg po qd
2. Digoxin 0.325 mg po qd

THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for 100 pack/year history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100. Blood pressure 120/47 ,
pulse 103 , sinus tachycardia. In
general , the patient was trached and in no acute distress. The
patient's skin revealed mottled distal extremities. HEENT:
normocephalic , atraumatic head. Trach was in place with a collar.
Lungs: bilateral inspiratory wheezes , scattered throughout.
Heart: regular rhythm with sinus tachycardia. Distant heart
sounds. No S3 or S4 were noted. The patient had no obvious
murmurs. Abdomen: positive bowel sounds. The patient was obese.
Abdomen was nontender , nondistended with no palpable masses. The
patient had multiple ecchymoses. Neurologic: the patient was
alert and oriented times three. Cranial nerves II through XII
grossly intact. Extremities: right buttock with approximately a
10 square centimeter decubitus ulcer. The patient's right lower
extremity revealed a previous harvest scar with about a 2 cm
incision and breakdown over the calf area. Distal foot has a
mottled appearance but has Dopplerable posterior tibial and
dorsalis pedis pulses. The toes are cool and insensate. Left
lower extremity revealed three open ulcers with marked gangrenous
muscle exposure. The patient had a Dopplerable posterior tibial
with cold pulses but no Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse. The
patient was insensate distally from the region of the wounds down
to the feet.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on 7/25/95 for a preoperative diagnosis of a
left lower extremity infected pressure sore. Intraoperatively , the
patient was noted to have necrosis of both heads of the
gastrocnemius muscle including the soleus and also a portion of the
lateral compartment. The muscle appeared black and necrotic and
there was a marked amount of purulence. Aerobic and anaerobic
cultures were obtained at this time and sent to Microbiology for
gram stains and cultures. All of the visibly blackened and
necrotic muscle was removed and the wound was irrigated with
copious amounts of antibiotic-containing solution. The patient
appeared to tolerate the procedure well and was sent to the
Intensive Care Unit , given the patient's cardiac history as well as
his ventilator dependence.
The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease service and was
started on Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl empirically until
culture results returned. The patient was taken back on 2/29/95
for a second irrigation and debridement procedure. During this
procedure , some necrotic skin , subcutaneous tissue and fascia were
noted and were sharply debrided free. The wound was relatively
clean upon completion of the procedure with no apparent loculations
or collections or purulence. The muscle also at this time appeared
viable and it was considered that the wound may heal on its own.
The patient was seen by the Vascular Surgery service as well for
his history of left lower extremity ischemia and for his loss of
his dorsalis pedis pulse on his left foot. The left foot remained
cool and insensate with no motor function. The patient did however
have flexion and extension at the knee.
After adequate irrigation and debridement , it was felt that the
patient would not require amputation of his lower extremity given
the viability of the muscle.
NEUROLOGIC. The patient was alert and awake postoperatively. The
patient was appropriate in his neurologic status. The patient
however did appear to have some episodes of anxiety for which he
was placed on Klonopin 1 mg po tid. The patient continued to do
well and had his pain adequately controlled with po Percocet.
RESPIRATORY. The patient was initially weaned off the ventilator
to continue his positive airway pressure with 5 of PEEP and 5 of
pressure support with 50% FIO2. The patient's tidal volumes were
consistently elevated over 600 and the patient had no subjective
complaints of shortness of breath. However , on postoperative day
#4 and #2 , the patient noted some difficulty catching his breath.
Pressure support was increased back up to 10. This inability of
the patient to maintain his spontaneous tidal volumes was
consistent with a respiratory fatigue secondary to his
diaphragmatic dysfunction. However because the patient appeared to
be weaning from the ventilator initially postop , it was decided
that the patient should have his diaphragmatic function assessed to
see if there had been any change.
The patient underwent a fluoroscopy study to assess his
diaphragmatic excursions on 2/8/95 . The test revealed no
diaphragmatic excursion consistent with phrenic nerve injury. It
was decided at this time that the patient would remain on his
previous ventilator settings of 10 of pressure support and 5 of
CPAP and 50% FIO2 and no further weaning would be attempted.
GASTROINTESTINAL. The patient arrived on tube feedings of Promote.
Because we do not have this at our institution , the patient was
started on a similar formula of full strength Ensure High Protein
at 105 cc/hour. This meets the patient's full nutritional
requirements.
However , because the patient appears to have no reason for not
encouraging his oral intake , the patient's tube feeds were
decreased to 50 cc/hour throughout the day for a 12 hour period and
po intake at this time was encouraged. The patient then received
12 hours of his tube feeds at 105 from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. The
patient was placed back on his normal subcutaneous doses of insulin
NPH 38 units in the morning and 38 units at night.
The patient has been treated intermittently with insulin drip for
control of his blood sugars during the times he was taken to and
from the Operating Room. Our goal for this patient is to attempt
to encourage his oral intake and to cycle his tube feeds only at
night. The patient should have 24 hour calorie counts initiated to
assess the adequacy of this oral intake.
GU. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and has good urine
output. The patient has excoriations around his inner thighs which
prevented us from removing his Foley in case the pt has episodes of
urinary incontinence. Once the patient's inner thighs heal , the
patient may have the Foley removed and the patient may be able to
void on his own in either a bedside urinal or with a condom cath in
place. The patient is receiving his Lasix 40 mg a day.
CARDIOVASCULAR. The patient was initially ruled out for a
myocardial infarction following his first operative procedure. The
patient has had no complaints of chest pain. The patient's
cardiovascular status has been stable with CVP's running in the 12
to 13 range. The patient had no episodes of hypotension and has
been continued on his Capoten.
HEMATOLOGIC. The patient has been stable with no issues. The
patient continues on subcutaneous heparin.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The patient was treated with Ampicillin ,
Gentamicin and Flagyl. The patient's intraoperative cultures from
his left leg ulcer grew out E. coli , sensitive to Ampicillin and
Ofloxacin. The patient also grew out Enterococcus , sensitive also
to Ampicillin and Ofloxacin and Enterobacter cloacae , sensitive to
Gentamicin and Ofloxacin. The patient was switched over from
Gentamicin to Ofloxacin to continue his antibiotic course. The
patient has been followed by the Infectious Disease service.
Because of the time of operation , it was considered that the
infectious tissue was completely debrided , and the patient does not
need to continue on an extensive antibiotic course.
The patient will receive 7 more days of po Ofloxacin as an
outpatient as per the ID service. The patient will have received ,
prior to discharge , a total of 7 days of IV Ampicillin and
Ofloxacin. The Flagyl was discontinued after day #6.
TUBES/LINES/DRAINS. The patient had a triple lumen catheter in
place which was removed on the day prior to discharge. The patient
had a peripheral IV placed in instead. The patient will not be
receiving any IV medications and will continue on oral antibiotic
dosings.
