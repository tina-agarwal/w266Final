ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: During this admission we evaluated your heart to make sure that it
was not the cause of your pain. In fact , your studies were improved from
your previous studies of yoru heart. It seems that your pain is likely
more due to your shoulder arthritis since the heart study we
performed was negative for blood flow problems to the heart. When you
have shoulder pain , you should try heat to the painful area ( or ice if
that helps more ) as well as Tylenol. You may also try ibuprofen in small
doses. Ibuprofen ( also known as Advil or Motrin ) is available in generic
form in your drugstore. It is not good for your stomach or your kidneys
so you should take only a very small amount as detailed in your discharge
summary. Because you had low blood sugar on admission to the hospital
we would like for you to take your diabetes pills only once a day
instead of twice a day until Dr. Daghita tells you differently.Your
medications are otherwise unchanged from your medications prior to your
admission. If you have weakness , shortness of breath , or
any other concerning symptoms you should seek medical attention
immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Adjust pain medications for shoulder pain
2. Referral for physical therapy
3. Adjustment of oral hypoglycemics if FSBGs are high - oral agents have
been reduced to once daily as pt was hypoglycemic on admission
No dictated summary
