Discharge Date: 3/0/2001
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CEREBRAL INFARCTIONS.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
3. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
4. SICK SINUS SYNDROME STATUS POST DDDR
PACEMAKER.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Briefly , this is an 80 year-old woman with
coronary history of hypertension , diabetes and
atrial fibrillation admitted to Friends Medical Center on the 30 of June for congestive heart failure and was at the time ,
diagnosed with receptive aphasia and a right hemianopsia. CT of
head was negative at that time and she was diagnosed with right MCA
stroke. She was started on anticoagulation as well as Lasix and
nitrites. Echocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed an
ejection fraction of 40 to 45%. She was transferred to the Stie Dickhall Hospital on the 16 of October for further evaluation
here.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for: 1. Sick sinus syndrome ,
complete heart block status post DDDR
pacemaker. 2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 3. DVT in 1992 ,
4. Right TKA , 5. Coronary artery disease , 6. CHF , 7.
Depression. 8. Diabetes. 9. Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: Include quinidine , procainamide and disopyramide.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Heparin , Lasix , Insulin , Cozaar ,
Imdur , aspirin , Humulin and sotalol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Was notable for: She had a
temperature of 99.9 , blood
pressure of 108/54 , pulse of 78 , 95% on four liters. She is an
obese , elderly woman in no apparent distress. HEAD AND NECK: Exam
revealed oral mucosa was moist. Normocephalic , atraumatic. NECK:
Notable for JVD of 11 to 12 cm. , no bruits. LUNGS: Crackles 1/3
of the way up bilaterally. She had regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft , benign. She had 1+
edema bilaterally; 1+ pulses. NEURO: Notable for alert and
oriented to time , place and person. Her language is notable for a
receptive aphasia. Her cranial nerves II through XII were intact
except for right hemianopsia. MOTOR: Gait was grossly normal.
Grip strength was 5/5 and symmetric. SENSORY: Grossly normal.
DTRs were 1+ and symmetric throughout. Toes were downgoing
bilaterally.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Were noted before of BUN , creatinine of 26/0.8 ,
K of 2.4. LFTs were within normal limits.
Initial CK was 42. She had an LDL of 42 , HDL of 30. TSH was 1.89 ,
Troponin was 0.12. White count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 31 ,
platelets of 156. Her INR was 1.3 , PTT was 35.7 , urinalysis
revealed 40 to 50 white cells , 1+ bacteria and 2+ leukocyte
esterase. Her chest x-ray was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ORGAN SYSTEM: 1. Neuro: The patient was
likely to have a left MCA stroke
at the outside hospital. Repeat CT at Er/na Hospital
confirmed these findings. She was continued on anticoagulation
since it was felt that most likely the etiology of stroke was
cardioembolic given her cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Of
note , she remained stable until the evening of the 27 of February when she
was found to have depressed mental status and new left hemiparesis.
Repeated head CT was unchanged and she was felt to have a new right
MCA stroke again due to cardioembolic causes. At this time , the
family made a decision to make her DNR/DNI. She was continued on
aspirin and started on full heparinization. Her neurologic status
remained stable and she has improved slowly. Her swallowing
improved and over the next several days ate normally. She
continued to have a receptive aphasia although this improved and
she was able to repeat although her naming remained poor. Physical
therapy and speech were consulted and followed the patient. She
continues to do well. Follow-up CTs have remained unchanged. She
will undergo a SPECT examination to confirm this stroke but
otherwise she has been transitioned to Coumadin for long-term
anticoagulation.
2. Cardiovascular: She is felt to have , given her new depressed
ejection fraction and Troponin leak , she was felt to possibly have
coronary disease and she was expected to go to coronary angiography
given her progressive neurologic symptoms. This was deferred and
she will be continued on conservative therapy including aspirin and
anticoagulation. She was felt to be in some congestive heart
failure and has been diuresed gently with some improvement in her
oxygenation and cardiac exam. Her rhythm should remain at AV paced
without any services.
DISPOSITION: The patient is to be referred to rehabilitation
center for further rehabilitation.

100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.
