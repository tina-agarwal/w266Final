HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 51-year-old woman with
end-stage renal disease on three times a week hemodialysis who
vomited during hemodialysis on the day prior to admission. She
completed her hemodialysis , went home , and continued to have
multiple episodes of non-biliary emesis. She was unable to take
po's including her antihypertensive medications. She did not
report any change in appetite though she was reluctant to eat due
to concerns about vomiting. She did not have any sick contacts.

picnic was known to be sick. She does not feel feverish per se
but does report some sensation of feeling heated while at dialysis ,
no chills. She has had normal bowel movements. She does report
a cough , which is productive of clear sputum. No chest pain , no
shortness of breath. She does have some abdominal pain that
occurs with her vomiting and retching. No visual changes from
baseline. She also reports dysuria and some increased frequency
of urination on the morning of admission. Of note , the patient
has been admitted in August of this year with
a similar presentation of nausea and vomiting with increased blood
pressures , which resolved with treatment for nausea and the
resumption of her blood pressure medications.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications prior to admission included regular insulin
on a sliding scale , aspirin 81 mg per day ,
Plavix 75 mg per day , metoprolol 50 mg three times a day ,
nifedipine 30 mg four times a day , losartan 100 mg once a day ,
allopurinol 100 mg every other day , Nexium 20 mg once a day , ursodiol
300 mg once a day , and Colace twice a day. The patient also
reports taking clonidine 0.1 mg three times a day.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis three times a week , diabetes mellitus type 2 with
retinopathy and neuropathy , hypertension , coronary artery disease
status post stent x4 in July 2005 , shown on repeat cardiac
catheterization in March 2006 to be patent , gout , primary
biliary cirrhosis , hypercholesterolemia , polymyalgia rheumatica. She is also
status post hysterectomy and status post cataract
surgery.
ALLERGIES: Though she does not report having any drug allergies , her
chart notes unspecified reactions to oral
hypoglycemics and calcitriol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not use tobacco and does not drink
alcohol. She lives with relatives.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient's vital signs
were temperature 97.8 , heart rate 79 , blood pressure 148/79. Her oxygen
saturation was 95% on room
air. She was not in any acute distress. Her JVP was flat. Her
mucous membranes were moist. She did not have cervical
lymphadenopathy. Her lungs were clear. Her cardiovascular exam
showed regular rate and rhythm with a loud 3/6 systolic murmur best
heard at the left upper sternal border. Her abdomen was
nontender and nondistended. Bowel sounds were present. No
hepatosplenomegaly was noted on exam. She did not have rebound
or guarding. She did not have lower extremity edema. Distal pulses
were present.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent labs on admission include: white
blood cell count of 4 with 81% polys and hematocrit of 35.5. Her
bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.3. Her amylase was 82. Her
lipase was 15. Her EKG showed sinus rhythm. Studies included a
chest x-ray on 9/11/06 , which showed stable cardiomegaly with
some interval progression in her mild interstitial edema and
stable bilateral effusions. She had a CT of her abdomen and
pelvis on 7/24/06 , which showed small bilateral pleural
effusions and a small pericardial effusion , splenomegaly with a
spleen measuring 16 cm. The liver appeared normal other than for
an area of focal fat or perfusion anomaly adjacent to the
falciform ligament. Gallstones were present. The stomach and
the small bowel were decompressed. There were no findings to
explain nausea or vomiting , and there was no evidence of bowel
obstruction. The patient also had an MR angio of the abdomen on
7/24/06 , which was unremarkable. Splenomegaly , cholelithiasis ,
and a trace pericardial effusion were noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 51-year-old woman with a
history of end-stage renal disease who presented with nausea and
vomiting and hypertensive urgency likely secondary to her
inability to tolerate her p.o. blood pressure medications.
1. GI. The patient had nausea and vomiting , which was
controlled with Reglan initially IV. She was then transitioned to
p.o. She had resolution of her nausea , but the nausea returned
when the Reglan was stopped , so she was maintained on a standing
dose of 5 mg Reglan before meals. An abdominal CT was done
and did not find evidence of obstruction or any other findings to
explain nausea or vomiting. An MR angiogram of the abdomen was
also done to evaluate for the possibility of vascular disease ,
but this exam was unremarkable.
2. Cardiovascular. There was concern for demand ischemia given
the patient's history of coronary artery disease and high blood
pressure. She did have a troponin of 0.38 , which came down to
0.25 , and then was undetectable. With treatment for nausea , the
patient was able to take her p.o. medications and her blood
pressures were controlled. Her metoprolol dose was increased to
75 t.i.d.
3. Renal. The patient was continued on Monday , Wednesday ,
Friday hemodialysis while she was in the hospital.
4. ID. The patient continued to have a low-grade temperature
while she was in the hospital. Multiple blood cultures were
drawn , which did not show any growth. She did have one UA , which
showed bacteria but which also had epithelial cells. She did
receive a seven-day course of antibiotics. She was
initially started on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and Flagyl given
concern for an abdominal process and then was switched and
covered briefly with ceftazidine before continuing the rest of
her course on levofloxacin. The patient was also tested for
tuberculosis given her persistent fevers and her history of
cough. She had a PPD placed on the day of discharge , which will
need to be read at dialysis on 4/10/06 .  The patient's
allopurinol was discontinued due to a concern that it could be
contributing to her fever.
5. Endocrine. The patient was maintained on an aspart sliding
scale and had modest blood glucose levels in the 100s.
6. Rheumatic. The patient had persistent fevers. She also had a
history in her chart of polymyalgia rheumatica though she was
not familiar with this diagnosis. She had an elevated ESR of 102
and an elevated CRP of 184. She also had a history of
hilar adenopathy seen on previous chest CT scans. A repeat chest
CT has been ordered and is pending at the time of discharge. The
Rheumatology Service was consulted and evaluated the patient. An
SPEP and IPEP were ordered to rule out gammopathy , and ANA was
ordered along with complement studies and antimitochondrial
antibodies. The results of these tests are pending and the
patient has been scheduled to follow up in the BMC Rheumatology Clinic
the week after discharge.
7. Consultants. The patient was seen by Dr. Chauncey Quandt of the SMH
Hematology Service and by the Rheumatology Service.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE: On the day of discharge , the
patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.3 , heart rate of
69 , and blood pressure of 155/77. Her oxygen saturation was 95%
on room air. Her physical exam was not significantly changed.
Her abdomen was benign. Her lungs were clear. Her heart had a
regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , clonidine 0.1 mg
t.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 20 mg p.o. daily ,
losartan 100 mg p.o. daily , Reglan 5 mg p.o. q.a.c. and h.s. ,
metoprolol 75 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nifedipine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and
ursodiol 300 mg p.o. daily.
