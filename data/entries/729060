Discharge Date: 8/7/2007
ATTENDING: STOMBERG , MARLON MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
The patient is admitted for a right gluteal hematoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with coronary artery disease
status post recent bare metal stenting in November ,
hypercholesterolemia , CLL and peripheral arterial disease and
admitted for increasing right thigh pain and falling
hematocrit at rehabilitation. The patient had a complicated
hospitalization in November where he presented with a severe
right MRSA infection of his right lower extremity. During
hospitalization , he required a revascularization prior to
undergoing surgery and had a bare metal stent placed to his left
anterior descending artery. After his stenting , he underwent a left BKA to
eradicate his left lower
extremity infection and was later noted to have a
right upper extremity clot associated with central venous catheter. The
patient was discharged from the hospital in November on Lovenox
80 mg twice daily and on Coumadin with the plan that his Lovenox
be stopped at the time of his Coumadin reaching a therapeutic
level. He was also discharged on aspirin and Plavix for his bare
metal stent. On the day prior to admission , the patient was
noted to have a hematocrit of 24 at rehab and on the day of
admission the Hct rechecked and was found to be 18. For this , he was
transferred to the Landm Hospital for further
workup. The patient denies any blood in the stool , melena ,
dizziness or lightheadedness. He does note some pain on his
right side , particularly his right upper thigh and gluteal
area. He denies any recent trauma. He felt some weakness in his
right leg but has had no paresthesias or pain. He states that
his leg has been at all times warm.
ED COURSE:
The patient was noted to be guaiac negative and complained of
some mild abdominal fullness. He received an abdominal CT , which
showed a very large right gluteal hematoma with a fresh fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed. The patient was given packed red
blood cells and was noted to have a potassium level of 5.8 for
which he received Kayexalate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Type II diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease status
post MI in 1997. He had a nonST elevation MI in 1/25 for
which he underwent catheterization. Catheterization at that time
showed an 80% left anterior descending lesion , which was stented
to 0 with a bare metal stent , 80% diagonal and first diagonal
lesion and a 100% circumflex lesion. The patient has known
significant peripheral vascular disease status post left TMA in
1/29 with fem-pop in 1/29 , left foot debridement in 9/5
and finally a left BKA in 1/8 He has congestive heart
failure with last ejection fraction of 32% , hyperlipidemia , gout ,
CLL status post fludarabine x4 cycles in 2004 in which has been
stable with no evidence of residual or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy , BPH , chronic kidney disease with a baseline
creatinine of 2.5 , and glaucoma.

b.i.d. , Xalatan one drop in the left eye every evening.
ALLERGIES:
His allergies include codeine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was in no acute distress. Normocephalic , atraumatic.
His eyes were anicteric. His extraocular membranes were intact.
Mucous membranes were moist without exudates. His neck was
supple , with full range of motion. He had 2+ carotid pulses on
both sides without any evidence of bruits. His jugular venous
pressure was approximately 8 cm of water at 30 degrees of
elevation. His lungs were notable for bibasilar crackles with
left side greater than right. Cardiovascular exam: He had
regular sinus rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , and he had a I/VI
systolic ejection murmur at his base. This seemed to radiate to
his axilla. His abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended.
He had normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants , no
hepatosplenomegaly or masses. His extremities are notable for a
right-sided gluteal hematoma with fullness and thickening. He
does have 1+ palpable DP pulse on that side confirmed with
Doppler. Skin was without rash , ecchymosis , or petechiae. His
neurological exam was intact. He was alert and oriented x3.
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact. He had intact
motor and sensation in his right lower extremity along with ,
however , was noted to have a baseline neuropathy with sensory
loss up to his admission.
Admission EKG is normal for normal sinus rhythm , normal axis , old
T-wave inversions in I and aVL and an isolated ST elevation in
lead 2.
Notable studies during this admission included CT of the abdomen
on admission which showed a new right gluteal hematoma with fluid
levels suggesting acute bleed.
ADMISSION LABS:
Potassium 5.8 , creatinine 2.1 , hematocrit of 22.3. He had an MRI
of his brain done on 6/21/06 which showed subacute infarction on
the right anterior internal capsule and chronic occlusion of the
left internal carotid and old left parietal stroke. He had an
echocardiogram done on 2/25/06 with an ejection fraction of
30-35% , trace aortic insufficiency , trace mitral regurgitation ,
trace tricuspid regurgitation and PA systolic pressures of 33+
right atrial pressure.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 62-year-old man admitted for a falling hematocrit with
an evolving right gluteal hematoma secondary to supratherapeutic
anticoagulation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS:
1. Right gluteal hematoma. The patient was admitted for low
hematocrit in the setting of being on multiple anticoagulant and
antiplatelet drugs. He was found to have right gluteal hematoma
which was responsible for his acute hematocrit drop. His
Coumadin , Lovenox , aspirin , and Plavix were initially held. He
received vitamin K and three units of FFP to reverse his
coagulopathy. He was also transfused a total of 6 units of PRBCs
for a goal hematocrit of 30 given his cardiac and neurologic
disease as described below. There was no evidence of further
hematocrit drop. Given that he had been anticoagulated due to
right upper extremity DVT and that the indication for
anticoagulation in the setting and catheter associated clot is
somewhat murky , it was felt that the patient would not benefit
from addition of anticoagulation and therefore his Lovenox and
Coumadin were discontinued. He was restarted on his aspirin and
and his Plavix and his Hct remained stable.
2. Non-ST-elevation MI. The patient was admitted in November
and was known to have three-vessel coronary disease and had
underwent stenting of his LAD with a bare metal stent on
7/15/06. After discussion with the cardiologist , he was stopped
on aspirin and Plavix given the evolution of hematoma and his
acute hematocrit drop. During his lowest hematocrit period , the
patient was noted to have lateral ST depressions and this
corresponded to a troponin leak with a peak troponin of 2.46.
The etiology of this was felt to be demand related to his
profound anemia and on correction of his anemia , the patient's ST
depressions resolved fully and his troponins trended downward.
The patient was known to have a presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy
following his nonST elevation MI. He was found to have an
ejection fraction of 30-35%. He will
need to have a repeat echocardiogram done in one month's time to
assess whether or not he would benefit from an implantable
cardiac defibrillator. The patient's blood pressure medications
were adjusted as follows. His blood pressure medications were
initially held due to his stroke-like symptoms at the time of
admission when his low hematocrit. As detailed below , however ,
they were slowly added back. He tolerated slow titration of
beta-blocker to goal heart rate and also addition of an ACE
inhibitor which was felt to be important given his extensive peripheral
vascular disease and his
low ejection fraction.
3. Recrudescence of stroke-like symptoms in the setting of the
patient's acute hematocrit drop. The patient was noted to have
worsening slurred speech and a right facial droop. He does carry
a history of left internal carotid occlusion and left-sided
stroke in the past. The Neurology team was consulted for these acute deficits
and requested an MRI. The MRI showed basically old known strokes and a
subacute right
internal capsule stroke that was felt to be unrelated to his
current symptomatology. He initially had his
antihypertensives to allow for maximal perfusion pressure. However , as
his coagulopathy resolved , it was felt that the stress that
resulted in the recrudescence of his old stroke-like symptoms was
resolved and he was able tolerate , further addition of his
antihypertensives without further incident.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was seen by physical therapy and given his recent
below the knee amputation , it was felt to be best served by going
back to rehab.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: His discharged medications are as
follows:
1. Tylenol 650 mg q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
2. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
3. Colace 100 mg twice daily.
4. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously daily.
5. Nexium 40 mg daily.
6. Lasix 80 mg in the morning and 40 mg at night which his IO
goals should be about -500 cc of fluid per day.
7. Neurontin 100 mg b.i.d.
8. Aspart 10 units subcutaneous with meals.
9. Aspart sliding scale.
9. Glargine 42 units daily.
10. Xalatan one drop.
11. Lisinopril 15 mg daily.
12. Toprol-XL 200 mg daily.
13. Niferex 150 mg daily.
14. Zocor 40 mg at night.
15. Flomax 0.4 mg daily.
16. Multivitamin one tablet daily.
17. Zinc 220 mg daily.
18. Plavix 75 mg po daily
FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
The patient is to call his primary care physician , Dr. Lupe Bario and his cardiologist , Dr. Mraw , following
discharge from rehabilitation. At that time , he should have
repeat echocardiogram to assess his candidacy for an implantable
cardiac defibrillator.
