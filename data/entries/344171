ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Afebrile. Blood pressure 106/60. Pulse 61. Respirations 20.
Oxygen saturation 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula. General exam
shows elderly female in no acute distress , on 2 liters nasal
cannula. HEENT exam shows moist mucus membranes , no
lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam shows 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the left lower sternal border. Regular rate. No
murmurs or gallops. JVP at 9 cm. Pulmonary exam shows crackles
bilateral lower one-half. Abdominal exam shows obese abdomen ,
nontender , nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities
show 2+ pulses distally and 1+ edema to the knees.
ADMISSION LABS:
Pertinent for sodium of 131 , glucose of 232 , a CK of 327 , CK-MB
of 10.5 , and a troponin less than assay. Urinalysis was
pertinent for 3+ protein , 2+ blood , 2+ leucocytes , and negative
nitrites. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 with
left atrial enlargement but unchanged otherwise. Chest x-ray on
admission showed pulmonary edema.
PROCEDURES:
Cardiac catheterization 3/22/05 ; no interval change since last
catheterization. 100% LAD , 100% left circumflex , 20% RCA
stenosis , LIMA graft to the LAD , patent SVG to D1. Disease was
not amenable to intervention. Please see catheter report for
further details.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: Initial troponin was negative. No EKG changes but on
the second set of cardiac enzymes , the troponin was elevated to
0.82. The patient was sent to Cath Lab for NSTEMI on 3/22/05 ,
with no interval change on cath noted and no intervention
performed. Troponins trended down thereafter less than assay.
The patient did have an episode of chest pain on 2/10/05 in the
setting of systolic blood pressure of 200 without EKG changes
currently. After assessing source of troponin leak on admission ,
but positively secondary to demand in the setting of hypertension
and acute/pulmonary edema. We will continue beta-blocker , ACE
inhibitor , statin , Imdur , Plavix and aspirin as an outpatient.
Pump: EF preserved on cath. Volume overloaded on admission
likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema secondary to
hypertension , diastolic dysfunction. The patient was diuresed
well on 40 mg of Lasix p.o. during her stay with the team on an
outpatient maintenance dose of Lasix 60 mg daily. The patient
was euvolemic on discharge. The blood pressures were labile
initially but better controlled with amlodipine and an increased
dose of captopril. Will continue as an outpatient on
beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor , calcium channel blocker.
Rhythm: Intermittent brachycardia to the high 30s , but always
asymptomatic. Lopressor dose was decreased from t.i.d. to b.i.d.
during her stay. She will continue on home dose of Toprol XL 25
mg p.o. daily.
Pulmonary: Status post acute shortness of breath episode prior to
admission requiring initially nonrebreather and nasal cannula
thereafter , which markedly improved with diuresis. The patient
was stable on room air at the time of discharge.
Endocrine: The patient was continued on her home insulin regimen
along with sliding scale , and she will be discharged on home
insulin regimen.
ID: The patient was noted to have a urinalysis consistent with
urinary tract infections and completed a 7-day course of
ciprofloxacin for complicating TI.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged in stable condition to rehab as an
outpatient.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
Temperature 98 degrees , blood pressure 122/55 , heart rate 55 , O2
saturation 93-95% on room air. General exam shows an elderly
female , resting , no acute distress , alert and oriented.
Cardiovascular: Shows regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. JVP at 8 cm.
Upon re-exam , shows bibasilar crackles. Abdominal exam shows
soft , abdomen that is nontender , nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds and extremity exam shows +1 edema to the calves.
The patient was to follow up with Dr. Andreas Hasson She will be
contacted in regard to the appointment date. She was instructed
to call Dr. Colvin if she notes a weight gain of 2 pounds at any
given day or a 5-pound weight gain in a week.
