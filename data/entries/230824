PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is the second Tal Hospital admission for this 55 year
old white gentleman who in 6/17 was first admitted for cardiac
catheterization for unstable angina. His cardiac risk factors
include adult-onset diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia ,
hypertension , family history of coronary artery disease , and prior
myocardial infarction. In 1982 , he developed exertional angina
treated with Isordil and in 1989 had a stress Thallium test which
showed mild inferior wall ischemia. In 6/17 he was admitted to
Tonm Medical Center for unstable angina and ruled out for
MI. His unstable angina continued and he was admittedo on 4/3/90
for cardiac catheterization to further study his coronary artery
disease. This catheterization showed a 95% left anterior
descending stenosis proximally and 80% distally , 95% proximal
occlusion of the right coronary artery , and an 80% occlusion of the
posterior descending artery. His cardiac index was 3.7 and it was
decided to schedule the patient for coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery which he underwent on 4/29/90 .  He had a left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery saphenous vein
grafts to the posterior descending and diagonal branches. His
course in the ICU was uncomplicated and he was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day #2 , where his course was complicated by
a few episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation with maintenance
of good blood pressure but some symptoms of lightheadedness and
diaphoresis.
DISPOSITION: This was brought under good control with Procainamide
and he was discharged on 4/29/90 on Procainamide one
gram p.o.q.i.d. and Glipizide 2.5 mg p.o.b.i.d. , and aspirin once
per day. Followup with Dr. Leon Wilson L. Bierman of PMVH .
