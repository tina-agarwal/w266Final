Discharge Date: 10/15/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old female
with a history of lupus , hypertension ,
asthma , breast cancer status post mastectomy and chemotherapy ,
rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation who was found
pauses of up to 6.6 seconds on a Holter monitor and was admitted
for consideration of pacer placement. The patient states that over
the last several months since March , 2001 , she has noted
increasing dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance.
She also has noticed episodes of palpitation. She presented to her
primary care physician in March , 2001 with these complaints. He
put a Holter monitor on her 11/9/01 which showed her to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates between 67 and 214 with a
mean rate of 117 beats per minute. Her primary care physician , Dr.
Esmond , initially put the patient on digoxin and Coumadin. Her
rate remained elevated , however , so he changed the Coumadin to
Cardizem. About one month ago he also added propafenone 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d. On 4/10 she presented to her cardiologist , Dr.
Cowser , complaining of continued palpitations and ankle edema.
He stopped her Cardizem at that time as he felt that was what was
contributing to her lower extremity edema and placed her on
atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.d. instead. She had a leepy Holter monitor
placed from 1/18/23. Wednesday morning , her second day of
atenolol , she noted having episodes where "I felt my heart pause
and then surge when it started to beat again". This was associated
with lightheadedness x several seconds. She did not have any
associated chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting ,
diaphoresis or syncope. She called Dr. Cedotal on 11/9 and he
told her to stop her atenolol and continue her propafenone. Over
the last two days she has had flutter episodes of irregular heart
beat but has had no lightheadedness since stopping the atenolol on
Wednesday. She has noted increased shortness of breath over the
last couple of days , as well , on climbing one flight of stairs.
She also has orthopnea using two pillows at night , does not have
PND , does have lower extremity edema. On the day of admission
which was 2/16/01 Dr. Mcferrin received a transmitted Holter recording
from Viewden Medical Center that showed the patient had normal sinus rhythm with
episodes of atrial fibrillation with high rates but also that she
had episodes of 6.6 second pauses. Thus , she called the patient
and had her sent via ambulance to the Cole General Health
emergency department for consideration of admission for pacemaker
placement. In the emergency department the patient's vitals were
she was afebrile with a pulse of 112 , blood pressure 150/81 ,
breathing 18 , satting 95% on room air. Her review of systems was
negative for fever , chills , or sweats , chest pain , syncope ,
abdominal pain , nausea and vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria or rash. In
the emergency department she revealed 40 of IV Lasix and was sent
to the floor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a 52-year-old female
resting comfortably at 45 degrees , in no
acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round and reactive to light
and accommodation. Oropharynx revealed moist mucous membranes , no
erythema. Neck veins appeared to be around 10 cm. CHEST:
Wheezing bilaterally and crackles at both bases. CARDIOVASCULAR:
Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1S2 , did have an S4 and did have a
3/6 holosystolic murmur loudest at the apex to the axilla. She
also had a 1/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left upper
sternal border. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , with good
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Warm , well perfused. She did have 2+
lower extremity edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 146 , potassium 3.6 ,
chloride 117 , bicarb 19 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 ,
glucose 120 , CK 76 , troponin 0 , CBC showed a white count of 8.73 ,
hematocrit 29.1 which was around her baseline. Her baseline had
been 30-38 on the last admission. Her platelets were 289. ESR was
75 which is what it had been in August . INR was 3.1
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
redistribution. Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at
94 with a normal axis , normal intervals. She did have left atrial
enlargement as well as right atrial enlargement. Her last echo
done at MH on 7/24/01 showed an ejection fraction of 63% ,
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , LV systolic function
preserved , a thickened mitral valve , moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation plus left atrial enlargement , aortic valve thickened ,
mild AI , no AS. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation , moderately
increased pulmonary artery pressures , normal RV plus her atrial
enlargement and they made notes that the mitral regurgitation was
increased on this echo when compared with an echo done one year
prior at BKTMC .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Breast cancer status post left
mastectomy with lymph node dissection
in 11/11 Pathology revealed invasive
ductal carcinoma , grade 3/3 , node
negative. She is status post four
cycles of Adriamycin and cytoxan.
2. History of lupus x 21 years.
3. History of rheumatic heart disease.
4. History of hypertension.
5. History of asthma diagnosed three years
ago.
6. History of recent atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lisinopril 40 q.d.; prednisone 10 q.d.;
Coumadin 5 q.d.; Prevacid 30 q.d.;
chloroquine 100 q.d.; Plaquenil 200 b.i.d.; Lasix 20 q.d.;
albuterol inhaler p.r.n.; Flovent 220 2-3 puffs b.i.d.; Flonase
b.i.d.; propafenone 150 t.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Tetracycline which give her nausea and vomiting
and sometimes she got that with aspirin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nurse currently on a medical leave of
absence. She lives alone. Tobacco history she
does smoke 1 pack per day since she was 23. No ethanol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Brother with sarcoid plus a history of
hypertension. Father with prostate cancer.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: From an ischemia standpoint
she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. We
did continue her antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril 40 q.d.
From a pump standpoint we felt that perhaps her mitral
regurgitation was the main cause of her 2-3 month history of
increasing dyspnea on exertion , exercise intolerance , and
increasing orthopnea. Thus , we got a repeat echo which showed
borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with an estimated ejection
fraction of 55% , normal RV. The mitral valve was moderately
thickened and rheumatic in appearance. The mitral valve area was
estimated at 1.3 cm squared although this may have an under
estimate. There is severe mitral regurgitation and moderate left
atrial enlargement. The aortic valve was calcified. There was
mild aortic insufficiency. There was mild tricuspid regurgitation
with a regurgitant velocity of 3.5 consistent with mild elevation
in pulmonary systolic pressures of approximately 48 mmHg plus right
atrial pressure. Given her severe and symptomatic mitral
regurgitation we then decided that she would likely benefit from a
mitral valve replacement. Then we proceeded to cardiac
catheterization. Her left heart catheterization showed a left
dominant system with clean coronary arteries. Her right heart
catheterization revealed elevated right ventricular and pulmonary
artery pressures and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of
31. She was diuresed several kg from her admission weight with IV
Lasix and she was continued on her ace inhibitor for afterload
reduction. Consultation with Dr. Mazingo of cardiothoracic surgery
was obtained and he felt that patient would indeed benefit greatly
from an MVR. Thus , plan was made for patient to be discharged home
and then to be readmitted electively when Dr. Brocks returned from
vacation for an MVR. From a rate and rhythm standpoint , the
patient was in normal sinus rhythm for the majority of her hospital
stay. We continued her propafenone and Coumadin for her history of
atrial fibrillation and she did have excellent rate control on
this. She had no further pauses on telemetry during hospital stay
and thus it was felt that given she was asymptomatic and did not
have any pauses off of beta blockade , that she did not need
pacemaker placement on this admission.
2 ) Pulmonary: From a pulmonary standpoint we felt that likely she
had cardiac asthma as with diuresis her wheezing and shortness of
breath was nearly 100% improved.
3 ) Rheumatology: From a rheumatologic standpoint her lupus was in
good control. She did not have of her typical lupus flare symptoms
such as arthralgias or rash , fever and , thus , we continued her on
her Plaquenil , her chloroquine and her prednisone.
4 ) Renal: She did not appear to have any renal involvement of her
lupus and her renal function was within normal limits throughout
her stay.
5 ) Heme: She had a normal cytic anemia at 29 which was within her
baseline range of 29-38. Full iron studies were sent and it was
felt that it was most likely consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.
6 ) Prophylaxis: From a prophylaxis standpoint she was on Coumadin
for atrial fibrillation so was not considered for heparin and she
was continued on Prilosec throughout her stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.; lisinopril 40
mg p.o.q.d.; magnesium gluconate 2 grams
p.o. b.i.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. a.m.; propafenone 225 mg p.o.
t.i.d.; Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.d.; K-Dur 60 mEq p.o.q.d.; Flovent 220
mg inhaled b.i.d.; Flonase 2 sprays nasally q.d. for her allergies
and postnasal drip; Prevacid 30 mg p.o.q.d.; chloroquine 100 mg
p.o.q.d.; Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOWUP: She had an appointment to follow up with Dr. Flecther
in one week's time and to follow up with Dr. Druvenga in
two weeks' time when he returned from vacation. At that time would
then follow up with an elective admission for MVR.
