Discharge Date: 5/25/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS IN THE DISTAL
RIGHT POPLITEAL VEIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49-year-old former
triage nurse who has suffered from
degenerative joint disease since 1977 when she was hit by a Amasa Di Cison
bus. She was hospitalized at that time and had a left calf deep
venous thrombosis secondary to extended bedrest. Her joint disease
involved primarily the L4 to S1 vertebra ( comprising two joint
spaces , and she reported this to have been exacerbated by an
attempted rape in 1980. At present , the patient suffers
considerable daily pain inhibiting her ability to work. The
patient recently received a facet block in March of 1991 at the
Dukey Darnha Hospital by the Pain Service which only seemed
to increase her pain. She described steadily worsening pain in
recent months and an increased portion of her time is therefore now
spent at bedrest due to her decreased mobility. The patient
described first experiencing left calf pain one and a half weeks
prior to this admission which manifested itself as a crampy pain of
short duration. She apparently saw her private medical doctor at
this time , Dr. Denver Lehnen , who sent her out on nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. On 9/11 , five days prior to admission ,
the patient awoke at night with severe right leg cramping. She , at
that time , went to the Mutes Hospital Emergency
Room where a noninvasive vascular study was positive for non
obstructive peroneal vein thrombosis. She was discharged on
Anaprox. On 8/8 , the patient returned to the DMC Emergency Room
complaining of increased pain and with great anxiety due to her
perceived risk of pulmonary embolus. The patient has had this
condition in the past and was quite concerned about it. Noninvasive
vascular studies at that time showed the lesion to be obstrutive in
the peroneal vein. However , there was no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis at that time. She was discharged on Coumadin , 5 mg q
day. On 1/24 , the patient experienced further worsening pain and
came to the Versteo University Medical Center for a second opinion. She
was heparinized in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Medical
Service. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denied chest pain ,
shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion , abdominal pain , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea or constipation , any recent weight loss or any
additional constitution of symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Occasional migraine headaches. L4-5 ruptured disc status post bus
accident in 1977. As stated above , she had a left lower extremity
deep venous thrombosis following that hospitalization. Previous
positive PPD , she had one year of treatment. Mugging in 1980 with
exacerbation of her joint disease. Emergency Room admission in 1988
for questionable cholecystitis. Facet block times two in 1986 and
1991. Periods of incremental menorrhagia. She is followed by Dr.
Ceo at the Warestar Medical Center .  Endometrial biopsy
recently performed was negative. Asthma. Gastritis. Appendectomy.
ALLERGIES: FISH. ERYTHROMYCIN. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE. FAMILY
HISTORY: The patient was raised by foster parents. She has some
knowledge of her natural parents. Her mother was retarded and died
of a pulmonary embolism. Her maternal grandmother had an

grandmother had cancer of the cervix. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is
divorced times 11 years. She lives with her 16-year-old daughter.
She has a positive smoking history. She denied drinking. She
denied intravenous drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission revealed a well developed ,
well nourished white woman in no acute
distress. The patient is mildly agitated and overly circumstantial
in her dialogue. Blood pressure 112/78. Pulse 100. Respiratory
rate is 24. Temperature 99.3. Skin was without lesions. HEENT
exam was within normal limits. Neck was supple without adenopathy.
She has a positive right anterior cervical mobile mass which
appeared to be a lipoma. She was without any jugular venous
distention. Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. Breast
exam was refused. Cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2 without S3 , S4 or any rubs , murmur or gallop.
Abdomen revealed positive bowel sounds. Abdomen was soft ,
nondistended without any hepatosplenomegaly. The patient had
normal sphincter tone , no masses , guaiac negative. Extremities
revealed right calf tenderness to palpation , slightly swollen , no
warmth , positive Homan's sign. No cords were felt. The left calf
was unremarkable with some point tenderness and right inner thigh ,
again no cords felt. There was no CVA tenderness. There was
positive point tenderness in the region of L4-5 , L5-S1.
Neurological exam revealed the patient to be alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. No deficit of
sensory proprioception or position sense.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a sodium of 140. Potassium
of 4.3. Chloride 105. Bicarb of 30. BUN 25.
Creatinine 1.2. Glucose 89. CBC was notable for a white blood
cell count of 11.9 with 22 lymphocytes , 7 monocytes , 67
neutrophils , 2 eosinophils. Hematocrit was 41.4. Platelet count
150 , 000. PT was 16.6. PTT 29.8. All other values were within
normal limits. Urinalysis was significant for a pH of 8.0 , 1-3
white cells , 0-2 red cells , 1+ bacteria. Chest x-ray was
remarkable for no infiltrates or effusions , positive hiatal hernia.
EKG revealed sinus rhythm at 90 with intervals of 0.18/0.08/0.36 ,
no ST changes , no change since 6/17 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 49-year-old female with a
history of prior deep venous thrombosis with
recent decreased mobility who presented with a painful right calf
with a documented right peroneal vein obstruction. Although the
clot is only documented to be below the knee , the question of
progression must be addressed. Initially , in light of strong data
supporting these events , anti-coagulation to prevent progression of
these clots , the decision was made to further anti-coagulate the
patient as she had minimal risks for this procedure. On admission ,
there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus by history of physical.
Right calf pain/deep venous thrombosis: On the second hospital
day , the patient had noninvasive Doppler studies of her lower
extremity which were significant for deep venous thrombosis in the
distal right popliteal vein. There were no other abnormalities
seen in either lower extremity. The patient was initially treated
with heparin since her PT was subtherapeutic on admission and
continued on Coumadin. By the second hospital day , the patient was
therapeutically Coumadinized and the dose was adjusted accordingly
with the goal of 17 to 19. As far as her leg pain was concerned ,
the patient was treated with Percocet for this problem. Physical
therapy came and evaluated the patient and helped her with
regaining her mobility. She was fitted with compression stockings.
Arrangements were made for VNA for the patient upon discharge.
2 ) Back pain - This is a longstanding problem for which this
patient has been treated for for many years. She refused any
consultation at this time by the Carmau Comgarf Hospital Pain Service. Instead , we
treated her with Percocet for these symptoms. 3 ) Agitation -
Patient is extremely agitated demonstrating almost hypomanic state
with pressured speech and Flight of ideas. She was initially on
Clonipin on admission on which she was maintained. In addition ,
she was given additional benzodiazepines to help with sleep.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. Patient was
therapeutically anti-coagulated and she was given a
regimen of Coumadin to take to be followed by Dr. Garth Schoenborn .
Disposition is to home with visiting nurse service. DISCHARGE
