Discharge Date: 5/14/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
PROBLEM LIST:
1. HYPERTENSION.
2. NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
4. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE.
5. PARKINSONISM.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 72 year old woman with a
history of hypertension , non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus , high cholesterol , who presents with
chest pain. She is status post a coronary artery bypass grafting
in 1992 and catheterizations in 1993 and 1998 and has had a long
history of stable angina. This angina is approximately once per
week , always responds to one sublingual nitroglycerin. It is
usually diffuse pain in the front of her chest and across her back.
The morning of admission she experienced shortness of breath and
chest pain which decreased after one sublingual nitroglycerin.
After lunch she had a repeated episode which was not relieved by
nitroglycerin. She came to the emergency room at the Choharlbull Community Hospital .  Electrocardiogram there showed lateral changes.
The patient has been recently undergoing a work up for a weight
loss of 40-50 pounds over only a couple of months. An ERCP in
0/26 showed narrowing in the common bile duct. This narrow was
stented and brushings were taken. These brushings were sent for
cytology and pathological analysis and they were not diagnostic.
This course status post ERCP was complicated by pancreatitis.
Echocardiogram in 11/19/98 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45%
with 2+ mitral regurgitation. The most recent catheterization in
1998 showed the SVG to OM1 graft patent , the SVG to RCA graft
patent , LAD was totally occluded , the RCA was 40-50% occluded , PDA
had an ostial 80% lesion that was rotabladed. This was complicated
by a perforation. She had a short stay in the CCU after this
procedure.
ALLERGIES: Dilaudid which makes her dizzy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting 1992.
2. Two catheterizations , 1993 and 1998.
3. Hypertension.
4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. High cholesterol.
6. Peripheral vascular disease , status post fem/pop and fem
thrombectomy.
7. Weight loss with constriction of the common bile ducts , status
post ERCP.
8. Pancreatitis post ERCP.
9. Parkinsonism.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; atenolol 25
mg once a day; Lisinopril 2.5 mg once a
day; Imdur 60 mg once a day; Metformin 500 mg twice a day; sinemet
25/100 twice a day; Zantac 150 mg twice a day; Zoloft 25 mg once a
day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No drinking , no smoking. She is a widow. She is

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.3 , pulse 66 ,
blood pressure 144/60 , breathing comfortably
on room air. GENERAL: This is a , comfortable , friendly
female. CHEST: Clear to auscultation. CARDIOVASCULAR: Present
S1S2 , regular rate and rhythm , positive II/VI systolic ejection
murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. ABDOMEN:
Benign. There is no edema. Neurologic exam notable for tremor ( baseline
per patient , and otherwise nonfocal ).
LABORATORY DATA: SM-7 normal with a creatinine of 0.8 , white count
5.11 , hematocrit 36.4 , platelets 243 , CK 30 ,
Troponin-I 0.02 , lipase 276 , albumin 4.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. She ruled out for the myocardial
infarction and had no further chest pain or electrocardiogram
changes. She had an exercise MIBI. On the exercise she went on a
modified Bruce for 6 minutes 25 seconds with a maximum heart rate
of 150. There were nondiagnostic ST changes during exercise and
she stopped due to fatigue. MIBI images showed the following:
There was a mixed transmural and nontransmural myocardial
infarction involving four cardiac segments in the inferior lateral
and lateral wall. There was moderate peri-infarct ischemia
involving additional segments. There was mild to moderate
ischemia involving three cardiac segments in the high lateral wall.
There was mild anterior septal ischemia. She went for cardiac
catheterization which showed the following: A right dominant
system with a left anterior descending that had lesions that were
40% and 50%. Diagonal had a 70% lesion that was stented to 20%.
Left circ was occluded with saphenous vein graft to the OM patent
and the saphenous vein graft to the RCA patent. There was in
addition a large 10 millimeter pseudoaneurysm at the site of the
previous PDA rotablation which was thrombosed with a coil. The
procedure was accomplished without complications. She had some
mild chest pain after the procedure which was reproducible with
palpation of her anterior ribs. The electrocardiogram did not show
change. The patient was discharged to follow up with Dr. Jamey P Kahao .
DISPOSITION: She was discharged to home in stable condition.
