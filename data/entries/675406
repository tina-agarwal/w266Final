myalgias and weakness. The patient has a history of type I
diabetes mellitus , end-stage renal disease with
subsequent renal transplant 11 years ago donated by his sister
for which he takes cyclosporine and azathioprine. The patient
had a neuropathic left plantar ulcer seven years ago for which he
underwent transmetatarsal amputation of his left foot at Westland Hotfland Medical Center . 
He has had a chronic recurrent ulcer of the left foot
over the last two years or so. The patient nonetheless was
reasonably doing well and very active. He recently did a 35-mile
bike ride in about four or five days prior to admission. He
developed nausea and vomiting which lasted for one day. He then
developed weakness and hyperglycemia. He tried to increase his
insulin , but found he did not have an adequate response. The
patient became more weak and was brought to the Therlaville Ady Hospital Emergency Department where he was found to have moderate
diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydration. The patient's workup also
suggested acute myocardial infarction and was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit. Echocardiogram was performed which revealed
an ejection fraction of 30% with dyskinesis of the inferior and
apical walls , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mild left
atrial enlargement and intact interatrial septum , mild mitral
regurgitation , left atrium with history of thrombus ,
inferobasilar and inferoseptal akinesis consistent with old
inferoposterior myocardial infarction , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , trileaflet aortic valve , which is quite mobile
with no evidence for significant aortic insufficiency , normal
pulmonic valve and aortic atherosclerosis. No pericardial
effusion and no evidence of endocarditis. The patient developed
a fever the day of admission and blood cultures were drawn which
grew out Streptococcus morbillorum and Bacteroides. His foot
became clearly boggy and grossly infected with necrosis.
Within an hour of that he underwent guillotine amputation of his
left foot. His temperature normalized and his foot cultures grew
out Streptococcus mutans and E. coli as well as Bacteroides
fragilis. He received ampicillin and sulbactam for bacteremia on
10/28/06 .  He underwent a coronary cardiac catheterization and
was found to have the following , left main coronary artery with
an ostial 100% stenosis. Formal report is not available at this
