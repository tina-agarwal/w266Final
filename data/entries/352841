BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
89 F Bagreen Con Ri woman with CAD s/p multiple PCI , CHF , anxiety , GER
D , atrial fibrillation , and profoundly demented at baseline ,
admitted via ED on 8/4/4 with SSCP , mild volume overload and
inability to cope at home. Has had multiple identical admissions over
the past year. Felt not to be a candidate for further
coronary iintervention. Admitted for ROMI , gentle
diuresis and mainly for placement issues.
Course:
1. CV:
-Ischemia: Ruled out by 3 sets of cardiac enzymes. No ischemic
changes on EKG. She was maintained on cardiac regimen: ASA , Isordil ,
statin , BB , ACEI. No further risk stratification was performed as
stated above.
-Pump: Mildly volume overloaded on admission. Was gently diuresed and t
hen changed back to baseline lasix PO dosing.
-Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation intermittently with sinus rhythm. Not
candidate for anticoagulation. Was bradycardic ( HR 40s-60s ) but
asymptomatic during course. Atenolol was changed to TID dosing of
lopressor given CRI ( Cr 1.9 ) and worry that renal clearance of drug
was impaired.
2. Psych: Demented at baseline. Continued home meds: remeron , zyprexa ,
dilantin.
3. Prophy: Will continue prophylactic dosing of lovenox at rehab ( not
contraindicated even with CRI ).
4. Dispo: Pt will be discharged to skilled nursing facility after
