DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: UNSTABLE ANGINA , ADMITTED FOR
PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY
ANGIOPLASTY.
HYPERTENSION.
BILATERAL RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS.
STATUS POST ONE EPISODE OF ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION ON 5 of January , WITH
SPONTANEOUS RESOLUTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 50 year old white
male transferred from
Re Hospital after an episode of atrial fibrillation on
5 of January , and unstable angina. Cardiac risk factors included
hypertension , smoking , family history. He had a myocardial
infarction in 1970 , and had been basically pain-free until 1985 ,
when he began experiencing stable angina , requiring one sublingual
nitroglycerin every 2 weeks. His typical anginal equivalent is
bilateral wrist tingling , plus some left arm or chest pressure. The
pain is brought on by exertion , relieved by nitroglycerin and rest.
His last exercise tolerance test with thallium was in 25 of June , when
he went 5 minutes on a standard Bruce protocol , and stopped because
of fatigue. Maximal blood pressure was 165/85 , heart rate 95 , rate
pressure product 15675. He experienced his typical wrist
discomfort , an his electrocardiogram showed left ventricular
hypertrophy with strain , focal premature ventricular contractions
and ventricular bigeminy. There was no evidence of ischemia on the
thallium images. On 5 of January , the patient experienced a left arm
dull ache radiating to the left side of his chest , unlike his usual
angina equivalent. It was not relieved by nitroglycerin or by
rest. He called his Tlakeno Rowt. Medical Center Of physician and
went to his local hospital. He denied palpitations , shortness of
breath , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis. On presentation , he was
found to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 140. He
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm and sinus
bradycardia to 55. He had no previous history of atrial
fibrillation. The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction ,
and while in the hospital experienced 3 to 4 episodes of his usual
anginal equivalent of wrist pain , relieved by 1 nitroglycerin each
time. It was unclear whether these symptoms were associated with
electrocardiogram changes. He received intravenous
trinitroglycerin at some point , and he was transferred here for
further evaluation of his rest pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed
hypertension , ischemic heart disease as above , peptic ulcer
disease , hiatal hernia. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION at the time of
transfer were diltiazem 90 milligrams by mouth 4 times a day ,
Lopressor 25 milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams
by mouth twice a day , Lisinopril 5 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,
Zantac 150 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep , digoxin .25
milligrams by mouth per day. ALLERGIES included no known drug
allergies. FAMILY HISTORY was positive for coronary artery
disease. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the patient has a desk job at a
furniture store. He used to smoke 3 packs per day , quit 6 years
ago. He drinks 3 beers a week. He lives with his wife and one son
at home , and 2 other grown children. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS was
negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure was 190/90 , pulse 60 and
regular , respiratory rate 16 , no acute
distress. Head and neck examination was unremarkable , jugular
venous pressure flat. Chest showed diminished breath sounds
diffusely , no wheezes or crackles. Cardiovascular examination
showed a III/VI systolic ejection murmur loudest at the aortic
area , and a II/VI systolic murmur at the apex radiating halfway to
the axilla. Abdomen was soft , benign. Femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally with bruits left greater than right. Extremities
showed no cyanosis , clubbing or edema , palpable pedal pulses.
Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: An echocardiogram at the outside hospital
on 8 of June , showed left atrium size 42
millimeters , mild left ventricular hypertrophy , posterior
hypokinesis , preserved systolic function , aortic sclerosis with a
peak pressure gradient of 36 mm/HG , read as moderate aortic
stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation. The electrocardiogram
showed sinus rhythm at 70 , left axis deviation , left ventricular
hypertrophy , left atrial enlargement , T-wave inversion in I and
AVL , V5 and V6 , strain pattern. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
SMA-7 was within normal limits , blood urea nitrogen 13 , creatinine
1.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: While in the hospital , the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex and right
coronary artery on 29 of March , and bilateral renal artery angioplasty
on 6 of September .  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm. He
experienced angina on 24 of June , with ischemic changes
anterolaterally. He underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty on 29 of March , and his 90% stenosis of the obtuse marginal
branch #2 was reduced to 30% and the 90% right coronary artery
distal lesion was reduced to a 30% residual. He tolerated the
procedure well with no complications. He also underwent renal
angiography , which showed bilateral renal artery stenosis , and for
this he underwent bilateral renal artery angioplasty on 6 of September ,
which he also tolerated well.
Renal arteriography and angioplasty were performed becuase of drug-resistant
hypertension and continued hypokalemia requiring K repletion even
when off diuretics. Prior work-up had revealed no evidence for
hyperaldosteronism.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was good. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE were Isordil 30 milligrams by mouth 3 times
a day , Zantac 150 milligrams by mouth at hour of sleep , Ecotrin 1
by mouth per day , K-Dur 40 mEq by mouth twice a day , Nifedipine 30
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , digoxin .25 milligrams by mouth
per day , Lopressor 100 milligrams by mouth twice a day. It was
felt that in time his antihypertensives can be adjusted as
necessary.
