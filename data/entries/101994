HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV:
*Pump: Cont'd ACE ( Lisinopril 40daily ) , utilized Lasix ( max Lasix dose
40IV bid ) to initiate diuresis. Orthopnea resolved after 3days of
diuresis. ECHO obtained on HD#4=nl LV size w/mild conc hypertrophy , and
severely reduced function ( EF15-20% ) and global hypokinesis. Mod RVE
and hypertrophy , and globally reduced function. Mild LAE , mod RAE.
Trace to mild MR , mod to severe TR , trace PR , and sm pericardial
effusion. The CHF service consult ( Dr. Busler ) obtained hx of 20oz
port wine consumption 3+days/wk. CHF team is attributing non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy to idiopathic vs ETOH. Rec'd goal SBP&lt;120 ,
agreed w/diuresis , ACE , +/-adding ARB , and changing b-blocker back to
Atenolol.
CHF team advised there is was clear indication for anti-coagulation. F/u
appts made Houston Jackson Hugo K. Torain . Pt will have VNA-CHF
home services.
Admit wt=197.6lbs , d/c wt=185.5lbs.
*Isch: Hx of NSTEMI , pos MIBI , neg cardiac cath 7/21 .  Has a baseline
abnormal EKG that is concerning for inf/lat ischemia. Had a troponin
leak this admit in setting of CHF. Repeat CAD workup not pursued. Cont'd
Aspirin , and B-blocker ( was initially on Metoprolol 25tid , then
transitioned back to Atenolol 50daily per CHF service recs ).
Tchol=119 , HDL=26 , LDL=77. Pt is DM , but no statin was started b/c of
elevated LFTs.
*Rhythm: Episode of NSVT 0/12 ( R-on-T VT in setting of QT prolongation
QTc=526 ). No additional ventricular arrhythmias were recorded on
via continuous telemetry monitoring. CHF service advised deferring AICD
placement unless pt fails 6mos of optimal medical CHF managment. Repeat
EKG's 9/10 QTc=495 , 11/17 QTc=478. Decision was made to cont Fluoxetine ,
given the minute risk that this med would contribute to QT prolongation.
2. GI:
*Team suspects hepatocongestion/GI venous congestion and/or gut ischemia
from poor arterial perfusion as cause of recent GI c/o's and LFTs. Low
grade abd pain and N/V resolved as team treated CHF , transaminases
remained ess unchanged.
PRN Reglan was continued. If GI symptoms return , pt may need additional
outpt workup ( HIDA scan , gastric emptying study ). Pt has an existing GI
appt to see Dr. Skwara in 8/5 . 
*Cont'd PPI for gastritis , duodenitis seen on EGD 8/15 .  It is unclear if
this can completely explain pt's Fe def anemia. She will need an outpt
colonoscopy to further eval.
*Celiac sprue studies were sent=pending at time of discharge.
3. ENDO: hx of DM-2 , HgA1c=8.8. Pt advised team that she prefer to
discontinue Glucophage in favor of starting insulin. During this admit DM
was managed w/bid NPH , pre-meal novolog , and AC/HS novolog scales. On
9/10 pt's total insulin requirement was 44units. FSBS 8/21 8am ) ,
271( 12pm ). Pt to transition to Lantus 35units qam to begin 10/7 .  VNA
arranged for insulin teaching and to assist PCP w/dose titration. Syringe
education was provided.
4. HEME:
*RBC: microcytic hypochromic fe deficient anemia. RI=2.19. Pt did not
save stool to perform stool guaiac testing. Cont'd Ferrous Sulfate this
admit , added Colace and Senna for constipation prophy. Will likely need
outpt colonoscopy , team deferring this to PCP and Dr. Daso ( outpt GI ).
Hg-electrophoresis was sent=pending at time of discharge.
*Coags: mildly elevated PTT/INR this admit. Suspect nutritional
depletion of vit K +/- ?liver dysfunction from CHF/liver congestion
leading to mild auto-anticoagulation. INR improved as pt able to
tolerate POs. She was not treated w/Vit K.
5. MISC:
*Nutrition consulted for heart failure and DM diet teaching.
TH social worker was consulted to assist pt w/maintaining abstinence
upon discharge. Pt given instructions to f/u w/her outpt Jerrod J Whitehill at Insonmahunt , New York 40955
