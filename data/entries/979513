BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
69 y/o woman with CAD s/p 4v-CABG , asthma , obesity and likely
consequent restrictive lung disease , OSA , diastolic dysfunction , IDDM
with retinopathy , presenting with 1 week increased SOB and 3 days of
pleuritic chest pain. SOB at 1 step is increased from baseline DOE
over the last week. Also with deep substernal chest pain x 3days which
may have been pleuritic and was necessarily exertional. Different pain
than anginal pain. Always slightly orthopneic , +LEE bilaterally. No
f/c/s. Some cough nonproductive . No sore throat or sick contacts. In
ED 97.8 70 150/70 100%2LNC.
Pain completely resolved with NTG x3 and ASA. Exam: Obese , midline
ventral hernia. JVP 11.
?lower lobe crackles. 2+ bilat LEE ( slight L&gt;R ). Cr 1.4 baseline.
Hct 34 baseline. WBC 8.2. enzymes neg x2. BNP 108 EKG with no changes
( ?old q wave ). CXR hard to interpret.
The differential diagnosis of the patient's chest pain included
cardiac ischemia , GI and PE. We ruled out ischemia and PE as causes dur
ing this admission , the pt attributes her symptoms to large vental
hernia , making it difficult for her to breathe.
PULM: She had a PE
CT with no large PE or large
DVT , possible brewing infiltrate in LLL vs atelectasis ( poor study
due to obesity ). LENI negative.
CV: Ruled out for MI by serial markers and EKGs. ECHO 5/16 multiple
areas of HK , EF 45% ( compared to 55%
on revious echo 6/17 ) , same MR ( mild/mod ) and trace TR. A cardiac PET
scan with dobutamine ( due to asthma ) on 1/5 showed mod sized area of
prior MI in OM/PDA territory ( consistent with area of old infarct ).
--Pump: JVP up: started lasix iv with goal negative 1L per day. W
e diuresed the patient and resumed her home meds ( we switched
diovan to 80 bid , from 160 qd on discharge ).
--FEN: diuresis. Follow lytes and volume status
--CODE: DNR/DNI during this admission per her discussion with our
team and with her PCP ( addressed during outpatient appointment ).
--GI: we continued the pt on a PPI
She was discharged home with PT and VNA.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please return to the Emergency room if you have any chest pain ,
shortness of breath or faint. Please follow up with Dr. Lloyd on
discharge.
