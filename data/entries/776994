ATTENDING: SEKUTERSKI , LEONARDO MD
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service.
DISPOSITION: To rehabilitation.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post AVR with a 23 CE , MVP
with 38 CE , and CABG x1/LAD endarterectomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Peluso is an 88-year-old male
with chronic atrial fibrillation , CAD and aortic stenosis since
1989 and being followed by a cardiologist in Prora who
presented to Stem,delfgilm Hospital in Nah Coton- An on 8/15/06 with chest pain
and shortness breath. Until 3/23 , he had been feeling generally
well without limiting dyspnea , fatigue , or chest pain. Since
then he has had two inpatient admissions in Hay Irv Co for
CHF. He complains of marked increase in dyspnea on exertion and
fatigue as well as PND/nocturia for the past three to four
months. He developed chest pressure and shortness of breath in
early morning of 8/15/06 and was subsequently brought by EMS to
Ara Nonter Memorial During admission , verapamil and isosorbide were
discontinued and he was started on low-dose beta-blocker. He was
also given diuretics for CHF with net 3 L negative balance. He
was also ruled out for acute myocardial infarction. His echo
showed critical aortic stenosis with a valve area 0.44 sq cm , EF
of 55% , moderate MR with valve area 3 sq cm with TR and moderate
pulmonary hypertension. He was then transferred to SH for
cardiac catheterization and possible valvuloplasty.
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS: Elective. The patient presented
with critical coronary anatomy/valve dysfunction. There is a
history of class III heart failure. Recent signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure include paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea/dyspnea on exertion/pulmonary edema on chest x-ray/pedal
edema. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter treated with drugs/beta
blocker.
PREVIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac cath in 1981
reportedly with 40% lesion in an unknown vessel.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Wide excision of melanoma in 1980.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of CAD.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with his wife who has macular degeneration
and has children. He quit smoking in 1950s. The patient is a
retired mechanical engineer.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PREOP MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 mg daily , Coumadin , Lasix 40 mg
b.i.d. , simvastatin 20 mg daily , Colace , MVI , and folate.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Height and weight , 5 feet 9 inches and 60
kg. Vital Signs: Temperature 99 , heart rate 88 , BP right arm
121/80 , left arm 118/78 , oxygen saturation 100% on room air.
HEENT: PERRLA/dentition without evidence of infection/no carotid
bruits. Chest: No incisions. Cardiovascular: Irregular
rhythm , systolic murmur. All distal pulses are intact.
Respiratory: Rales present bilaterally. Abdomen: No incisions ,
soft , no masses. Extremities: Without scarring , varicosities ,
or edema. Neuro: Alert and oriented , no focal deficits.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA: Chemistries: Sodium 134 ,
potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , CO2 27 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 113 , and magnesium 2.0. Hematology: WBC 9.43 ,
hematocrit 38.2 , hemoglobin 13.5 , platelets 126 , 000 , PT 15.9 , INR
1.3 , PTT 76.1. UA was normal. Cardiac catheterization data from
5/1/06 performed at AH showed coronary anatomy 60% proximal
LAD , 70% ostial D1 , left dominant circulation. Echo from
4/12/06 showed 55% ejection fraction , aortic stenosis , mean
gradient 80 mmHg , peak gradient 121 mmHg , calculated valve area
0.4 sq cm , moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid
insufficiency , left ventricular enlargement , hypertrophied with
reasonable systolic function , severe aortic stenosis , and
moderate mitral regurgitation. There is a markedly left atrial
enlargement , which is probably secondary to pulmonary
hypertension. EKG from 3/14/06 showed atrial fibrillation rate
of 78 , septal infarct. Chest x-ray from 1/26/06 was consistent
with CHF. The lungs are well expanded , stable. Multiple chamber
cardiac enlargement is seen. The bilateral small pleural
effusions decreased in size. No pneumothorax was identified. No
focal consolidation was seen. The patient was admitted to CSS
and stabilized for surgery.
DATE OF SURGERY: 5/20/06.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: CAD , AS , MR.
PROCEDURE: An ascending aortic resection/AVR with a 23 CE
pericardial valve , MVP with 38 CE ring and ring annuloplasty ,
CABG x1 SVG1 to LAD and LAD endarterectomy.
BYPASS TIME: 303 minutes.
CROSSCLAMP TIME: 225 minutes.
CIRC ARREST: 7 minutes.
There were no complications. The patient was transferred to the
unit in stable fashion with lines and tubes intact. On postop
day #1 in the unit , chest x-ray/EKG within normal limits ,
bilateral lower extremities mottled to stable , good pedal pulses
bilaterally. Continuing to monitor. On postop day #2 ,
hematocrit 25.3 , transfused two units PRBC. Hemodynamically
stable. On postop day #3 , extubated , off pressors. Failed video
swallow evaluation. He was transferred to Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #3.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: No issues.
Cardiovascular: No issues. On aspirin , Lopressor , and Coumadin.
Respiratory: No issues. Have been extubated on postop day #2.
GI: N.p.o. Video swallow showed aspiration. Nutrition will
continue to follow with recommendations.
Renal: No issues.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulated with aspirin and Coumadin. Recent
mitral valve repair/atrial fib.
ID: No issues.
Of note , recent video swallow , the patient needs Dobbhoff tubes
for meds p.o. until Nutrition gives further Rx.
On the Step-Down Unit , starting postop day #3 , no narcotics. An
88-year-old status post circ arrest confused , impulsive and on
sitter , Pacing wire remains in place.
On postop day #4 , rate controlled A fib , hypertensive , added
low-dose captopril to Lopressor 12.5 q.i.d. , diuresing well ,
remains on 1.5 L O2 , strict n.p.o. for aspiration per Speech and
Swallow. On tube feeds via Dobbhoff , confusion improving , no
narcotics/sedatives. UA sent for MS changes , negative for UTI.
Wires discontinued. Coumadin for A fib. Rehabilitation
screening initiated.
On postop day #5 , rate controlled A fib , Coumadin. BP still
hypertensive , increased captopril to 12.5 t.i.d. Ambulating with
PT on room air. Dobbhoff in place. All meds/nutrition via
Dobbhoff. Postop echo ordered for MVP. Off sitters today , clear
mental status. No narcotics/sedatives. UA clean.
On postop day #6 , rate controlled A fib. BP improved on
captopril. Cards following , recommending to preferentially
increase Lopressor and decrease captopril as tolerated. Of note ,
the patient has been quite hypertensive this week with heart rate
well controlled even low-dose Lopressor. Increased Lopressor to
25 mg q.i.d. , captopril 12.5 t.i.d. Creatinine 0.4 , has diuresed
well. Postop echo with an EF of 45% to 50% , moderate LVH ,
hypokinetic anterior septal and inferior wall , normal RV. Severe
LAE and RAE , paravalvular leak seen at AVR with mild AI , trace
MR , mild TR. Also has large left pleural effusion , was seen on
echo. Only small bilateral effusions were seen on chest x-ray.
The patient's main issue now is PT and Speech and Swallow
reassessment. Dobbhoff was repositioned today for tube in
stomach with tip newly pointing upwards into the esophagus.
Post-repositioning KUB shows tip now downwards in stomach. Given
some Reglan to advance. Clear mental status. Junky cough cannot
produce sputum for sample. Afebrile. White count 9.8.
Nutrition and EMS Rx followed , has recovered very well ,
ambulating on room air.
On postop day #7 , repeat video swallow scheduled for Monday.
Coumadin started. Coumadin continued and started Plavix for LAD
endarterectomy , off aspirin. Possible PEG placement pending
video swallow results. Repeat chest x-ray with minimal left
effusion.
On postop day #8 , holding Coumadin for possible PEG next week
pending video swallow on Monday. No heparin for now per Dr.
Ernesto Umbel
On postop day #9 , tube feeds off at midnight , getting repeat
video swallow on a.m. for speech and swallow. Holding Coumadin ,
which was given for chronic A fib pending possible PEG placement.
On postop day #10 , A fib/room air. Video swallow study showed
improvement , but patient still silently aspirating. Speech and
swallow recommends PEG and continued work with Speech and Swallow
for eventual goal of patient taking p.o.'s. Contacted Metabolic
Support. They will send someone to evaluate the patient for PEG ,
so the procedure will likely take place on Wednesday or Thursday.
On postop day #11 , A fib/room air , feeding tubes were part way
out , readvanced and got KUB showing good placement. Metabolic
support evaluated the patient , got consent for PEG.
On postop day #12 , A fib/room air , holding tube feeds and
Coumadin for PEG placement , scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday. No
heparin per Dr. Christman May go to rehab once INR therapeutic for
A fib. The patient had a four-beat run of VT.
On postop day #13 , he was supposed to have PEG placed today.
Metabolic support said that someone called the OR desk yesterday
and canceled the procedure , so it was rescheduled for Tuesday due
to no OR availability. Otherwise , the patient was supposed to
have repeat video swallow next week. Hemodynamically stable.
Holding Coumadin. Rehabilitation when ready.
On postop day #14 , PEG tube placement rescheduled for next
Tuesday , giving low-dose Coumadin for A fib , at goal tube feeds
through Dobhoff , hemodynamically stable.
On postop day #15 , doing well. General surgery consult called to
try and get PEG placed earlier the next Tuesday. Dr. Len Dechart will do it either tomorrow or Monday at the latest.
Otherwise , doing well , n.p.o. after midnight. Hopefully , he will
get PEG and can go to rehabilitation.
On postop day #16 , tube feeding restarted. PEG placement
tomorrow. Otherwise , doing well , rate controlled A fib.
Rehabilitation once PEG tube placed.
On postop day #17 , finally received peg today , currently on D5 in
a half at 50 mL an hour , okay to give meds through PEG and can
restart tube feeds tomorrow. NG tube out. Coumadin to restart
tonight. PT/rehabilitation screening.
On postop day #18 , started tube feeds this morning , advancing
rate without difficulty. The patient ambulating with assistance ,
rate controlled A fib/2 L O2 stable. Plan to rehab tomorrow.
The patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to be stable
to discharge to rehabilitation on postop day #19 with the
following discharge instructions.
