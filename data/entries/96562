SERVICE:
Cardiac Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Borge is a 64-year-old gentleman with a previous history of
myocardial infarction x4 who presented to the Emergency
Department on 4/17/06 with shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion over the previous two months. The patient has known
coronary artery disease and has undergone multiple PTCAs and
balloon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branch
of his right coronary artery in 1996 , and stenting of his
posterior descending coronary artery in 2004 , also stenting of
his distal right coronary artery in 2005. While in the emergency
department , the patient had an episode of substernal chest
pressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. He
received sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. EKG
at that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with T-wave
inversions in the leads V2 , V3 , and slightly T-wave elevation in
leads II , III and aVF. On 0/16/06 , he underwent cardiac
catheterization , which revealed the following , posterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , right
coronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflex
coronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anterior
descending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. Right
dominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensive
stenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. Distal right
coronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aortic
stenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmHg and peak gradient of 60
mmHg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency ,
moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency ,
and mild pulmonic insufficiency. Carotid ultrasound revealed
right internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , left
internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis. Pulmonary
function tests revealed FVC of 3.11 , 53% , and an FEV1 of 1.66 ,
35% predicted. Chest CT also performed on 6/21/06 revealed
cardiomegaly , massive calcifications involving the aortic valve
and coronary arteries , pleural thickening bilaterally , nodular
density measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the left
lung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleural
thickening , however , subpleural nodule cannot be excluded ,
recommending a repeat chest CT in six months after discharge , and
small ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas.
PAST MEDICAL AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for myocardial infarction , class II angina with
slight limitation of ordinary activity , class III heart failure
with marked limitation of physical activity , status post a PTCA
atherectomy and stent placement , hypertension ,
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , gout ,
anemia , positive PPD , status post INH treatment , herniated disk ,
history bladder cancer , status post chemotherapy treatment ,
polysubstance abuse including ethanol and tobacco , narcotics , and
IV drug abuse. He is also status post a left thoracotomy for
pleural effusion 30 years ago , a hemorrhoidectomy , and bilateral
hand surgeries for contractures.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION:
Atenolol 50 mg once a day , lisinopril 20 mg once a day ,
isosorbide 30 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg daily ,
Lasix 40 mg daily , atorvastatin 80 mg daily , gemfibrozil 600 mg
b.i.d. , metformin 1 g b.i.d. , glimepiride 2 mg daily , oxycodone
10 mg q.6 h. as needed for pain , and Nexium 20 mg daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiac exam: Regular rate and rhythm , with a grade 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. Peripheral
vascular , 2+ pulses bilaterally in the carotid and radial pulses ,
1+ bilaterally in the femoral and dorsalis pedis pulses , and
nonpalpable bilaterally in the posterior tibialis pulses.
Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Extremities:
Mild varicosities. There is 1+ pedal edema in bilateral lower
extremities , otherwise , noncontributory.
ADMISSION LABORATORY VALUES:
Sodium 138 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 97 , CO2 32 , BUN 26 ,
creatinine 1.1 , glucose 66 , and magnesium 2. BNP is 2349. WBC
6.45 , hematocrit 31.6 , hemoglobin 9.9 , and platelets 192 , 000.
PT/INR of 1.3 , PTT of 33.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Kreidler was brought to the operating room on 3/25/06 where
he underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm
Carpentier-Edwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graft
x2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery. Total bypass time was 164 minutes. Total
crossclamp time was 127 minutes. Intraoperatively , the patient
was found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was a
bicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp ,
moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiring
adhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. Transesophageal
echocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aortic
prosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittent
heart block following bypass predominantly with A pacing. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and in stable condition. Please refer to dictation
number 5125348 for the immediate postoperative course. The
patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 9/28/06 .  The
patient's mental status waxed and waned with confusion , initially
was with sitters in the Step-Down Unit , and also was in a
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation , with a good blood pressure ,
and tolerated increasing beta-blocker. The patient's mental
status improved , did well off sitters , and continue with
rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Mr. Salser was placed on
Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. Neurologically , he
remained intact , and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycin
for H. flu and Staph pneumonia , which are both sensitive to
Bactrim , and started on a 5-day course of Bactrim twice a day.
He was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #9.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY VALUES:
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 99 , CO2 28 , BUN 18 ,
creatinine 0.9 , glucose 95 , and magnesium 1.7. WBC 12.07 ,
hematocrit 27.9 , hemoglobin 8.6 , and platelets 396 , 000. PT of
19.3 , PT/INR of 1.6.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg t.i.d. while taking

daily , Lopressor 25 mg q.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg b.i.d. , oxycodone
10 mg q.6 h. p.r.n. pain , multivitamin with minerals one tab

slow release 10 mEq daily with his Lasix , Bactrim double strength
one tab q.12 h. for five days , Plavix 75 mg daily , Lipitor 80 mg
daily , and Coumadin , the patient received 6 mg of Coumadin this
evening for his atrial fibrillation. He will be followed by
Ercoln Er Hospital Anticoagulation Service at
300-135-5841.
FOLLOW UP:
Mr. Moose will follow up with Dr. Quincy Hamernik in six weeks , his
cardiologist , Dr. Domenic Whang in one week in the Cardiology
Clinic Tions Medical Center .  He will also have a
follow-up chest CT to follow up on the 7 mm subpleural nodular
density in the left lung base in approximately six months that
will be set up by his primary care physician and cardiologist.
DISPOSITION:
He is discharged to home in stable condition with visiting nurse.
