wet-to-dry dressing changes t.i.d. initially. On 6/3/2003 , he
was taken to the operating room for left groin closure with flap
by Plastic Surgery and Vascular Surgery. The flap initially was
pink and viable , however , on 4/20/2003 , there were noted some
pale areas and mottling of the flap. He was injected with
heparin solution. Following this , flap received serial needle
pricks and the appearance gradually improved as such there was no
further pallor or mottling. The patient developed diarrhea. He
was on vancomycin , levofloxacin , with p.o. Flagyl for empiric
treatment for C. diff. C. diff cultures were negative on

100 mg b.i.d. with goal diuresis of 1-2 liters per day. IV Lasix
was added p.r.n. to achieve this goal. After his episode of
nausea , his EKG was checked to rule out any sort of cardio
ischemic cause for this nausea , EKG was normal. His morphine was
discontinued as a possible cause. He did well with p.o. pain
medications. Renal: His Zestril was held secondary to an

gradually resolved. Creatinine was 2.5 at the time of discharge.
