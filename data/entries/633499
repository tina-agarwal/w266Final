medical management of CV status , and dialysis done 0/20 . 
Cardiology Consult 0/20 for Troponin rising to 2.9 ?if CABG candidate ,
cards suggesting med mgt. Increased the lopressor with goal b/p
&lt;130. Troponin max 2.99 on 0/20 .  RHcath after

and adenosine mibi on 9/10 showed minimal ischemia
of inferior-lateral wall and ?defect in
