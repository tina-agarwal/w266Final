HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV. The patient was felt to be high risk for CAD on presentation
with her ESRD and DM. Will typical chest pain and a positive troponin
she was felt to have NSTEMI and was immediately placed on Reopro and
Heparin gtt , as well as nitro gtt for BP and pain control. She did well
overnight and went to hemodialysis and then directly to catheterization
the next morning. She was found to have a 70% LAD lesion which was
stented with a DES. She was started on ACEI , lipitor , ASA , plavix and
her oupatient lopressor was increased. She did well post-cath ,
complaining only of mild numbness/tingling in the lateral R thigh thought
to be a mild compression neuropathy from laying flat for hours post-cath.
Her groin was stable without hematoma and she had good peripheral
pulses. She was discharged to home to continue her cardiac medications
and follow-up with her cardiologist , Dr. Madaffari , and her PCP. Her BP was
well controlled and she had no rhythm issues throughout the
hospitalization.
2. ESRD. She was followed by the renal team throughout hospitalization
for hemodialysis and had no issues. Per the renal team she received
pre-cath mucomyst as she still makes some urine , and she was started on
lisinopril. She continued on nephrocaps. She will continue HD at
Paz General Hospital every MWF after discharge.
3. GOUT: She was continued on her outpatient allopurinol.
4. DM. She was continued on her outpatient insulin regimen with good
FSBG control.
5. COPD. She was continued on her outpatient atrovent with PRN
albuterol and she has oxygen at home.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your chest pain was caused by decreased flow to your heart muscle which
was corrected with a metal stent to keep the blood vessel in your heart
open. It is VERY important that you NEVER miss a day of your new
medication PLAVIX because this medication keeps that metal stent open.
Call Dr. Brownlie or Dr. Wendelberger if you have any chest pain , shortness of
breath or any other worrisome symptoms. Keep eating a heart-healthy
diet , gradually increase your exercise back to your baseline and take all
of your med
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
