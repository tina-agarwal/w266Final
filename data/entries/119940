ATTENDING: GOSNELL , BRICE M.D.
PRELIMINARY DISCHARGE SUMMARY.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON DISCHARGE: Aspiration pneumonia , line
infection , refractor asthma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 59-year-old female well
known to the team on admission with a history of COPD/asthma ,
history of intubation , CHF ( EF of 30% ) , diabetes , schizoaffective
disorder who presents with worsening shortness of breath and
dyspnea as well as night sweats from Landall Medical Center .  She was
discharged from GMS to rehab on March after being admitted
for shortness of breath and treated as a COPD flare with one week
of azithromycin , prednisone taper and nebulizer treatments. She
was discharged with good O2 sats in the 90s on two liters ( her
home O2 requirement is 2 liters ). Now she presents with
worsening shortness of breath , night sweats and cough which is
productive. She denies chest pain , palpitations ,
lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. She also finished a
course of levofloxacin after an admit from August to 1 of February for
similar symptoms.
She was transferred from the Landchi Vier Community Hospital to Townfaxt Medical Center ED with
vital signs at that time were 99.5 , heart rate of 120 , blood
pressure of 105/35 , and a respiratory rate of 36 , and 81% on room
air and 86% on 5 liters. She received 1 mg of Ativan , 5 duonebs ,
500 mg IV of clindamycin , 500 mg of levofloxacin. Her ABG at
that time was 7.32/82/113 . Her troponin was 0.13 and her BNP was
29. It was thought that she required ICU care and since no beds
were available at Morei Horan Winblo Health Center , she was transferred to the
Ceville Tianfaulkharb Medical Center . Her vital signs on admission include a heart rate of
110 , a blood pressure of 190/55 , respiratory rate of 32 and sats
87 to 89% on 4 liters , going up to 95% on 6 liters. She received
vancomycin 1.5 IV x1 , albuterol and Atrovent nebs stack as well
as aspirin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for COPD/asthma with last
pulmonary function tests in March 2005 showing an FVC of 41% ,
FEV1 of 0.74 liters , 33% , and a ratio of FEV1/FVC of 83%. Also ,
schizoaffective disorder/questionable bipolar , GERD , diabetes ,
CHF with EF of 30% , and an echo in March 2005 , hypertension
and steroid myopathy.

ALLERGIES: Penicillin , sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone but has husband who is involved
in her care. Attends Geri-day program three times per week.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Heart rate of 105 , blood
pressure 98/64. Sat of 94% on six liters. On general exam , she
was morbidly obese , working to breathe , speaking in phrases.
Wanting water. Respiratory distress. HEENT: Tearing eyes.
Sclerae anicteric. Extraocular muscles intact. Oropharynx was
clear. Chest with very poor air movement. It was end expiratory
wheezes throughout. Her cardiovascular: JVP not visualized
secondary to body habitus. Tachycardic. Distant heart sounds.
Abdomen was soft , obese , nontender , nondistended. Her
extremities: There was 2+ edema to the knee level.
LABS: Remarkable labs on admission include a creatinine of 1.7 ,
a bicarb of 38 , her BNP was 29 , troponin was 0.13. Her crit was
32.4 , white blood count 7.6 , and platelets 267. On the
differential her white blood count was 93 polys , no bands. Coags
were within normal limits. Her UA was ??__??. EKG showed sinus
tachycardia 106 , some T-wave inversions in lead 1 , some
flattening in lead 5 , but essentially unchanged from prior.
Chest x-ray: Portable AP view with stable cardiomegaly ,
questionable of lower lobe infiltrate but no evidence of CHF.
ANALYSIS AND PLAN: On admission , this is a 59-year-old female
with history of recent COPD and asthma exacerbation , diabetes ,
CHF , who presents with worsening shortness of breath and
suspected right middle lobe pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Pulmonary: The patient presented with hypercarbic , hypoxemic
respiratory distress , most likely secondary to a recurrent
pneumonia in the setting of her baseline obstructive/restrictive
pulmonary disease. She was not found to be volume overloaded on
admission , and she had a D-Dimer that was negative as well. Her
restrictive lung disease is most likely secondary to her body
habitus leading to obesity hyperventilation syndrome and her
obstructive disease have components of asthma since has
responsive bronchodilation after beta-agonist. The management of
her respiratory status involved initially starting on steroids ,
prednisone 60 mg , frequent nebs , as well as continuing her Advair
and Singulair. It was also planned to use BiPAP since she might
have sleep apnea component despite no objective data supporting
that. She on second day of hospital stay , was under increased
respiratory distress. A repeat blood gas showed a pH of 7.27 , a
PCO2 of 88 , and a PO2 of 82 on 50% of O2. Since clinically
patient was deteriorating , it was decided that she would benefit
of intubation. The patient was intubated on March and was
placed on AC mode. On ventilation , the patient initially
required AC since she was not able to maintain good total volumes
on pressure support. Multiple times that it was attempted to
wean her off the ventilator , she developed increased respiratory
distress and decreased total volume with ventilator mechanics
showing increased airway resistance. Despite frequent nebs , she
was unable to be weaned off the ventilator. On March , after
multiple attempts , it was decided that she would benefit from
longterm ventilatory support. She underwent a PEG and
tracheostomy placement by Dr. Rosaro with no complications. Since
March , her ventilatory settings were decreased to pressure
support with peep of 5 and a pressure support of 10. She had two
recurrent episodes of increased respiratory distress when moved
in bed. It was suspected that her respiratory distress was
related to a mechanical obstruction of her tracheostomy and prior
to discharge , she will be getting a different trach recommended
by surgery which will minimize this mechanical obstruction.
Otherwise , she is currently on 40% of FIO2 and a peep of 5 ,
pressure support of 12 and at those settings she is getting tidal
volumes in the range from 380 to 450 and O2 sats between 98 and
100%.
2. ID: Her chest x-ray had a suspected right middle lobe
infiltrate in addition to the fever and increased white blood
count. It was decided that she would benefit from nosocomial
pneumonia coverage. Her first course of antibiotics included
levo , clinda. , as well as vancomycin. Cultures of her sputum and
blood were sent , were negative. Her sputum cultures just grew
oral flora and her blood cultures initially were all negative but
on March , she had a positive culture for staph. , guaiac
negative , in the setting of a central venous line. It was
thought at that moment that she had secondary infection which was
MSSE line infection and all lines were pulled and she was
continued on vancomycin for another 14 days. Her antibiotics
were switched to ceftaz. , azithromycin , clindamycin and
vancomycin. She received a total of 21 days of antibiotics and
prior to discharge had finished her ceftaz. and Flagyl. She also
received a 14 day course of vancomycin after the central venous
lines were removed and since then she has been afebrile and all
blood cultures after March have been negative , so about 10
days with negative blood cultures and sputum cultures.
Just prior to discharge , her left IJ line will be removed since
she just finished her course of antibiotics as well as her
peripheral A line.
Endocrine: The patient received high dose of steroids ,
prednisone 60 mg , for about two weeks and had a couple of
attempts to decrease the prednisone but responded with increased
broncho-resistance on ventilator measurements and it was decided
to keep her at a higher dose. The week prior to admission , a
slow tapering was started with 50 mg for 5 days , then 50 mg for
another 4 days and on discharge , she was on the transition point
to 30 mg. She was getting calcium carbonate and vitamin D for
osteoporosis prevention. Her diabetes was managed with Lantus
100 units a day with Portland Insulin Protocol on initial ICU
stay transitioned to Regular Insulin scale. She was not needing
any extra insulin units prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: The patient had recent workup for CAD including
Cath which was negative , but she did have an elevation troponin
which was likely secondary to demand ischemia with spontaneous
resolution. She was continued on aspirin. There was no angina
or new changes in EKG during this admission.
B. Pump: She looked slightly volume overloaded on admission.
She received Lasix
80 IV b.i.d. and her diuretic regimen was titrated and she might
need , once discharged ,
a standing dose of Lasix to maintain her I's and O's goal even.
Her blood pressure off the ACE inhibitor on hospital stay ranged
between 112 and 130. We plan to restart her on a small-dose ACE
inhibitor prior to discharge with the objective of better blood
pressure control as well as renal protection from her diabetes.
We will not restart Isordil since patient had no evidence of
coronary artery disease.
Psych: We will continue home regimen of Trileptal , Depakote as
well as Risperdal.
Heme: Her hematocrit has remained stable during this admission.
Since she was getting multiple blood draws , she received about 2
units of packed red blood cells and all her workup for a source
of anemia was negative including vitamin B12 , including iron
studies as well. Her heme ?__? panel was also negative.
Musculoskeletal: Patient had an infiltrative ?___? on her left
arm around her peripheral IV access. The infiltration lead to a
large ulcer which was managed by Plastics. They recommended only
b.i.d. dressing changes. There were no signs of evident
infection in the site and healing since that event has been quite
good. There are some signs of granulation tissue in the ulcer
base but no erythema or pus around it. Physical Therapy has
been involved in the case and have been doing tremendous work in
putting her sitting upright , as well as gaining increased
strength on her extremity. She is still unable to raise her arm
against gravity but she has 2/5 muscle strength throughout and
she will likely need intensive rehab once she is discharged.
FEN: She had a metabolic test performed which yielded a measure
resting energy expender of 2121 kilocalories a day and a
predicted basal metabolic rate of 1771 kilocalories a day. Those
results yielded to an increase in her tube feedings which are
consisted of Osmolite 1.2 at 70 cc an hour.
