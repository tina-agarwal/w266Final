Discharge Date: 6/20/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SYNCOPE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. IDIOPATHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 64-year-old woman who
has lived in Tall Dis Thou since 1993.
She has a history of chest pain and has a baseline EKG with an
intraventricular conduction delay , QRS interval of 0.10. Her
cardiac history includes: In February 1988 , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test for chest pain. The patient went 7 minutes
35 seconds and had a maximum heart rate of 100 , maximum blood
pressure not recorded. She developed a left bundle branch block
with exercise. A thallium scan showed no evidence of ischemia. In
July 1992 , she had an exercise tolerance test for chest pain and
shortness of breath. She went 9 minutes 0 seconds and had a
maximum heart rate of 167 with maximum blood pressure 138/60. She
developed angina during the test. The SPECT scan showed a moderate
fixed defect in the apicolateral wall. In 8/21 , she had an EKG
done which showed normal sinus rhythm with a QRS interval of 0.10
and moderate LVH. In 1995 , the patient states that she had a
cardiac catheterization in Auriend Road , Kane Cho , Mississippi 13286 which showed no coronary
disease , although she was told that she had a cardiomyopathy. The
patient reports feeling well until the day of admission without any
chest pain , shortness of breath , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , or
orthopnea in the recent past. On the afternoon of admission , at
about 2 o'clock in the afternoon , she was watching television. She
arose from the couch and went to the kitchen to get a cup of
coffee. She recalls filling her cup with water , then recalls
nothing else until she awoke with her grandchildren lying on half
of her on the floor and crying. The patient was oriented upon
awakening and recognized her grandchildren immediately. She did
not have any incontinence or tongue biting. She denied muscle
aches , somnolence , confusion , or weakness. She went to the couch
to sit down and had nausea and vomiting about five minutes after
her syncopal episode. She also noted a bump on the right side of
her head and subsequently developed a headache. She did not have
any neurologic symptoms , denied any chest pain or shortness of
breath. She was diaphoretic at the time that she was sitting on
the cough , nauseous and vomiting afterwards. She had no
palpitations and she had no presyncopal sensation or dizziness at
any time. She does report having a history of palpitations in the
past , but none on the day of admission. She had no fevers , chills ,
or other sick contacts. She had no prior history of syncope or
loss of consciousness. She had no history of seizures or transient
neurologic symptoms. In addition , she does report that she has a
history of chest pain. The last time was more than a year prior to
admission. She has no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no pedal
edema , no orthopnea , and no change in exercise tolerance recently.
She climbs stairs without any problems.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Chest pain , last
episode approximately one year prior to
admission. 3. Palpitations. 4. Question of cardiomyopathy ,
diagnosed by cardiac catheterization in Sa in 1995.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Vasotec 10 mg p.o. q.day. 2. Digoxin
0.25 mg p.o. q.day. 3. Lasix 20 mg q.day.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease , stroke ,
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and sudden death.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient does not smoke , does not drink
alcohol , and does not use IV drugs. She lives
with her daughter in Co Ville at this time of year. She works in an
outreach program as a nurse. She came from Ige Pkwy , Norfsta Olk Mer , New Hampshire 25909 where she
has been since 1993. Prior to that time , she was living in Birhamstonro
and receiving medical care at the Cla Du Rencein Hospital . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs included a blood pressure of
130/70 , pulse 62 ( the patient had a blood
pressure of 200/100 when initially seen in the Emergency
Department ). She was an elderly woman in no apparent distress.
Her HEENT examination was remarkable for having poor dentition.
Her JVP was at 8 cm. Her chest was clear. Her cardiovascular
examination revealed an S1 , S2 and intermittent S3 , no murmurs ,
with regular rate. Her abdomen was soft and nontender. Her
extremities were warm without any cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.
Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her mental status was
entirely intact. Cranial nerve examination was grossly intact.
Her reflexes were 2+ throughout and her toes did not respond to the
Babinski stimulation.
LABORATORY DATA: She had a CK of 119 , magnesium 2.2. Her digoxin
level was 0.7. Troponin I was 0. Electrolytes
were entirely within normal limits , as were BUN and creatinine.
White blood cell count was 10.3 , hematocrit 36.5 , and platelet
count 298. Urinalysis revealed 0-1 white cells , 0-1 red cells , 1+
bacteria , and 1+ epithelial cells. Chest x-ray revealed no
evidence of congestive heart failure or infiltrate. EKG , at the
time of admission , showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 93 with
intervals of 0.183 , 0.15 , and 0.417. She had a left bundle branch
block which was new since her 1993 EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for work up of her
syncopal episode. By hospital day one , the
patient underwent a rule out for myocardial infarction. Her
enzymes were flat and her EKG showed no changes consistent with
acute myocardial infarction. In addition , she underwent an
echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of 30%-35%. She
also had anterolateral wall motion abnormalities. On the following
day , the patient underwent a right sided heart catheterization ,
which revealed that her coronary arteries were completely clean.
She underwent an EP study which was entirely normal. On the
following hospital day , she underwent an exercise tolerance test ,
and no arrhythmias were triggered by her exercise. Carotid
noninvasive studies revealed minimal disease bilaterally , and the
neurology service was consulted. The patient also underwent a tilt
table study , which was entirely normal , with no suggestion of a
vasovagal response. At the time of discharge , the patient had had
no further symptoms and no further episodes of syncope while in
hospital. Her Holter monitor results are pending. The feeling is
that her syncopal event was most likely cardiac related , probably
related to a tachycardic arrhythmia. However , her neurologic work
up is still underway. She is to have an MRI/MRA as an outpatient
and to follow up in DISPAN NI TI HOSPITAL clinic , as well as with Dr. Triche for
further discussion as to whether AICD placement might be in order.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day. 2. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.day. 3.
Vasotec 15 mg p.o. q.day. 4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.day. 5. Atenolol
12.5 mg p.o. q.day.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home to follow up in
I MINVIC MEDICAL CENTER clinic with me ( Leo Paponetti ) on 7/20/97 .  She
will have an MRA/MRI of her brain scheduled as an outpatient. In
addition , she will be set up with an ECG loop recorder for further
monitoring of events at home.
