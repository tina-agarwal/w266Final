INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND BRIEF SUMMARY: This is a 27-year-old
female with a history of craniopharyngioma , status post resection
and XRT in 1993 with subsequent panhypopituitarism and chronic
sleepiness. She was admitted to the General Medical Service on
8/0/05 with a two-week history of a.m. confusion , visual changes ,
ataxia , tinnitus , bilateral lower extremity edema , and shortness
of breath. She had also had easy bruising and a severe episode
of epistaxis requiring cauterization. Her blood work was notable
for pancytopenia. She then had swelling of her hands and arms as
well as a rash. MRI in 11/2 showed no change or evidence of
tumor recurrence. The patient , while on the General Medical
Service , had an extensive rheumatologic , neurologic , and
hematologic workup , at which point she underwent both bone marrow
biopsy and unsuccessful LP under IV conscious sedation. The
patient became unresponsive and hypothermic about 2 hours after
her bone marrow biopsy and was therefore transferred to the MICU
on 10/9/05 for closer observation. She seemed encephalopathic
during this stay and was started empirically on ampicillin ,
cefoxitin , and acyclovir. She was then sent for a CT-guided
lumbar puncture requiring intubation. She was extubated on
11/24/05 . She was then transferred out to the floor where she
continued to improve. Hospital course in more detail by system
below.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and uses
CPAP at home. Her outpatient pulmonologist at the Ceanmin Chbre Memorial
was contacted who confirmed this. On admission , she had a normal
O2 saturation with a relatively clear chest x-ray. However , she
became hypothermic and unresponsive following her bone marrow
biopsy. She also required intubation for CT-guided lumbar
puncture for airway protection in the setting of her excessive
sedation. She was extubated on 11/24/05 and her oxygen was
quickly weaned off. Since then she has been oxygenating and
ventilating well on room air. CPAP was continued at night. She
has had no other pulmonary complications.
2. CVS. The patient has no history of cardiac disease. An
echocardiogram done on 1/3/05 showed normal LV function with
preserved ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities ,
moderate tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral regurgitation.
In terms of her rhythm , the patient has a resting bradycardia in
the 30s to 40s that is thought to be secondary to increased vagal
tone and has no hemodynamic consequence. She received atropine
while in the ICU at 1 mg x 1 on two separate occasions; in the
first instance for bradycardia to a heart rate of 19 in the
setting of getting vasoconstrictors for a low blood pressure and
the second time when she had a heart rate down to 30. After the
patient was transferred out to the floor , we did obtain a
dedicated EP Service Cardiology consult , who evaluated the
patient. They confirmed that her bradycardia is most likely due
to vagal tone. She responds appropriately with an increase in
her heart rate with exertion. In this young woman , it was deemed
that a pacemaker would not be an appropriate choice. She did
have 3-4 second pauses on one occasion on the floor but had no
recurrence throughout the rest of her stay. If after discharge
she develops further pauses or a syncopal episode , this issue can
be revisited. While she was in house , we did keep atropine and
Zoll pads at the bedside but did not have to use it once she was
transferred out of the ICU. In terms of ischemia , the patient
had a slightly elevated CK-MB on admission , but she has had a
normal echocardiogram and negative troponin since.
3. Renal. The patient developed acute renal failure during the
early part of her stay thought secondary to acyclovir , which had
been given for presumptive meningitis. Her abdominal ultrasound
was negative and urine eosinophils were also negative. Her
creatinine improved with appropriate hydration and was normal at
the time of discharge ( creatinine equal to 1.0 ).
4. The patient does have a history of hypernatremia. Initially ,
her home DDAVP was held for fear that it would be difficult to
diurese her if she became volume overloaded given her somewhat
elevated creatinine. However , her sodium continued to increase
to 155 despite getting free water repletion , so her DDAVP was
restarted on 7/3/05 . She was discharged on her home dose of
DDAVP of 0.2 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 0.4 mg p.o. q.p.m. with one nasal
spray q.h.s. Her sodium at the time of discharge was 145. She
has been followed by the Endocrine Service in house for this.
They have recommended that she not increase her home dose ,
instead she will aggressively increase her p.o. water intake in
order to maintain her normal sodium. She will follow up in two
weeks with Dr. Kearley of Endocrine who will recheck her
electrolytes at that time.
5. Derm/Rheumatology. The patient was evaluated by both of
these services during her stay. She had biopsies done of several
locations that showed nonspecific pathology consistent with mixed
connective tissue disease. However , her serologies have , for the
most part , been negative. She was treated presumptively with
stress-dose and eventually pulse steroids. These were tapered
towards her stay. She will be discharged on a quick taper of
hydrocortisone 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two days , after which she
will revert to her home dose of 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 10 mg p.o.
q.p.m.
6. Endocrine. The patient has panhypopituitarism and was
followed by the Endocrine Service throughout her stay. In terms
of her thyroid function , the patient was continued on her home
dose of Levoxyl. It was difficult to interpret her TSH in the
setting of panhypopituitarism; therefore we followed her T4 , T3 ,
and free T4 levels. These were rechecked towards the end of her
stay once she had recovered from her acute illness and in light
of a slightly decreased free T4 level , her Levoxyl was increased
to 275 mcg p.o. daily at the time of discharge.
7. Diabetes insipidus. The patient's hypernatremia was
corrected with D5 water and increasing her p.o. fluid intake.
She was also put back on her home dose of DDAVP.
8. Growth hormone. There was no indication for growth hormone
replacement.
9. Adrenal insufficiency. The patient completed a course of
stress dose steroids for her procedures and then got pulse
steroids per wound for a question of lupus versus mixed
connective tissue disorder. However , this was tapered over her
stay and she will be discharged on a very brief taper. She will
go back to her home regimen of hydrocortisone.
10. Gonadotropins. The patient was continued on Aviane ( OCP )
during her stay.
11. Neurologic. The patient had no clear etiology for her
hypersomnolence. She was followed by the Neurologic Service in
house. She does not appear to be hypercarbic or hypoxic. Her
infectious workup was entirely negative and she was therefore
taken off antibiotics. Her EEG showed nonspecific diffuse
slowing with no seizure foci. The default diagnosis has been
that some of her symptoms , including her altered mental status ,
lower extremity edema , rash , and perhaps even pancytopenia , may
be secondary to Provigil. This was therefore discontinued and
she should not start this once she returns home. Initially , her
stimulants were held for fear that they were contributing to her
pancytopenia. However , her Ritalin was restarted once her counts
started to recover. She was discharged on Ritalin-SR 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. Her mental status seemed to improve on this regimen. At
the time of discharge , she was awake , alert , able to converse
well , and at her baseline.
12. Hematologic. The patient presented with pancytopenia , again
of unclear etiology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for
leukemia , lymphoma , and myelodysplasia. Rather , it was
consistent with a viral effect or drug effect. Her counts had
resolved by the time of discharge with a white blood count equal
to 9.26 , hematocrit of 27.6 , and platelets of 266. This too may
have been due to Provigil effect.
13. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on Pepcid for GI
prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
14. Code. Full.
15. ID. The patient had multiple blood , urine cultures , and CSF
cultures sent. These were all negative. Of note , stool culture
was positive for C. difficile. She was therefore started on p.o.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. on 3/18/05 . She will complete a 14-day
course of this antibiotic.
DISPOSITION: Home with VNA services.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Satisfactory.
COMPLICATIONS DURING THIS HOSPITAL STAY: None.
TO DO/FOLLOWUP PLAN:
1. The patient should follow up with her PCP in 1-2 weeks.
2. The patient should follow up with Dr. Bodenstein in the Endocrine
Department in 2-4 weeks. She can be reached at 586-252-5253.
3. The patient should aggressively increase her oral water
intake in order to keep her sodium within normal limits.
4. The patient should call her doctor if she has any changes in
her mental status or if she develops nausea , vomiting , abdominal
pain , rash , shortness of breath , lightheadedness , or any other
worrisome symptoms.
5. Of note , the patient's biopsy sutures on her left abdomen and
right forearm were removed on the day of discharge. These areas
appear to have healed well. Her central line was also removed on
6/1/05 without complications.
