ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You have been admitted to the hospital with chest pain. Your chest pain
is likely due to a combination of your coronary artery disease and
anxiety. You did not have a heart attack. Rather this appears to be
stable angina and your current medication regimen is maximized for this
treatment. You also developed a fast heart rhythm called atrial flutter
when you were admitted , but your heart returned to normal rhythm on its
own. Thus , no medications are being started for this. As an
outpatient you will get an ECHO and also some heart monitoring that
will be arranged by Dr. Sapper You will be called with the times for
this. You should continue the same medications that you were previously
taking. If you develop light-headedness , chest pain , or shortness of
breath , you should call your doctor.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
*PCP - patient will need ECHO and Cardiac Monitoring as an outpatient.
