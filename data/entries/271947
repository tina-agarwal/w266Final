Discharge Date: 7/19/1991
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: RESTENOSIS OF LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING
CORONARY ARTERY AND STATUS POST ANGIOPLASTY.
OTHER PROBLEMS: RESTENOSIS OF LAD CORONARY ARTERY FOLLOWING PTCA
IN August . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56 year old
firefighter , who is status post PTCA
in July 1991 who presents with a two day history of fleeting
left arm pain. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: ( 1 ) Includes a distant
history of smoking , ( 2 ) borderline increased cholesterol , ( 3 )
positive family history. He does not have hypertension. He does
not have diabetes mellitus. The patient was without significant
cardiac history until 0/11/91 when he developed mild substernal
chest pain with exertion relieved by rest. There was shortness of
breath and diaphoresis. On 3/14/91 , he again had substernal chest
pain with exertion and was relieved by rest , but recurred with more
exertion. There was no radiation to the neck or the arms. At
Cyhutche Arahagnes Adam Hospital , where he presented with the pain , the
pain was gone with oxygen and one sublingual Nitroglycerin. EKG
was initially normal , but with more changes. There were flipped
T-waves which were relieved by IV heparin and sublingual
Nitroglycerin. His CK's at that time were 54 , 59 , 46 , 54 , and 36.
The isoenzymes were negative. On 9/13/91 , he was transferred to
the Firstrybroodi Medical Center .  Catheterization revealed 70-80%
stenosis of the proximal LAD which was thrombosed. His LV function
was approximately 76% ejection fraction. On 11/9/91 , he developed
substernal chest pain after the heparin was stopped , which resolved
with restarting the heparin. On 1/8/91 , he had a PTCA which
decreased the lesion from 90% stenosis to 10% without
complications. On 3/15/91 , he was discharged on Lopressor and
Aspirin. Since then , the patient has been pain free and without
shortness of breath. One day prior to admission , while a passenger
in a car back to Ton Mon Park U Twin A , he noted 5-10 episodes of fleeting 15
second episodes of achiness in his left arm from the shoulder to
the fingertips. He denies shortness of breath , chest pain , or neck
pain. He denies a history of trauma. He has a history of
arthritis , but not to the left arm. On the day of admission , he
had a few more episodes of "achy" pain in the left arm. He
presented to BC , and his EKG showed T-wave inversions in II ,
T-wave flattening in III , with normalization in v2 and V3. He had
upright T-waves in V4 , V5 , and V6 compared to downhard T-waves on
3/15/91 .  There were no Q-waves. Again , he denied chest pain ,
shortness of breath , neck or jaw pain , diaphoresis , or
palpitations. He presented to the Varfrank Trin Aetage Hospital
Emergency Room. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes arthritis in the
knees , history of kidney stones , and low back pain. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION: Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Aspirin one tablet p.o.
q.d. He has no known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Was
positive for a mother with diabetes and heart disease. SOCIAL
HISTORY: He is a retired firefighter. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Showed
no melena , no bright red blood per rectum , no dysuria , no abdominal
pain , and no evidence of claudication. He has occasional knee
discomfort.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is afebrile with a blood pressure of
130/90 , heart rate 60 , and a respiratory
rate of 18. He was a well developed , well nourished white male in
no acute distress. His HEENT exam was benign. Neck: Carotids
were 2+ without bruits. Back exam showed that the lungs were clear
to auscultation. There was no CVA tenderness. Heart exam was a
regular rhythm and rate , bradycardiac , S1 and S2 , without murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdominal exam was benign. Pulses were 2+ ,
carotids were 2+ on the right and the left , 2+ at the femorals
bilaterally , the posterior tibialis was 2+ , and the dorsalis pedis
was trace to 0 in both feet. All of the toes were warm. The feet
were warm and without discoloration. Rectal exam was deferred.
Extremities: Without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Were unremarkable. The BUN was 13 ,
creatinine 0.9. He had a CK of 39
initially , and the following results were 33 eight hours after the
initial one , and then 24 eight hours after the second CK. His
liver function tests were unremarkable. The PT and PTT were 11.7
and 30.3 respectively. He had a white count of 8.5 thousand , and
he had a hematocrit of 39.4 with an MCV of 87 and 261 , 000
platelets. His chest x-ray showed normal heart size. There was no
effusions or infiltrates. The EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 55 ,
normal intervals , axis of -60 degrees. There were T-wave
inversions in II and T-wave flattening in III , pseudonormalization
in V2-V3 , with upright T-waves in V4 , V5 , and V6 compared to a
3/15/91 tracing. Because of the atypical nature of the chest pain
and because it did not reproduce the chest pain that he had in
July , the patient was not put on IV heparin. He was given an
exercise stress test , full Bruce protocol , the following day which
showed marked lateral 3-4 mm depressions in the lateral leads ,
consistent with ischemia. He had no chest pain or shortness of
breath during the entire exercise stress test which lasted
approximately ten minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue only.
He was brought to cardiac catheterization on the following day ,
10/10/91 .  A stenosis of the LAD lesion was found in the same place
where this stenosis had been two months ago. PTCA of this lesion
was successful although the final report is pending at the time of
this dictation.
DISPOSITION: He is discharged to home on Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and Aspirin 80 mg p.o. q.d. He is advised to
followup with his physician , Dr. Bruce Dorie at LMMC .  He is
discharged home in fair to good condition. He should have no
difficulties in activities because of this hospitalization.
