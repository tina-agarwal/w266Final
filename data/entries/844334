Discharge Date: 10/1/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Raffo is a 59-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post small non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in
March of 2000 and also status post cardiac catheterization with 2
vessel disease , small left PICA cerebrovascular accident ,
congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in March
revealing an ejection fraction of 30%. Also diabetes mellitus type
II complicated by retinopathy , nephropathy and question neuropathy.
History of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia as well who
presented to Dr. Bouie clinic on March , 2001 with
progressive increasing dyspnea , increasing abdominal girth and
weight gain over the past few months.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus x 20 years , chronic renal
insufficiency with the last creatinine in
March of 3.5 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
30% in March of 2000 , coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction , March 2000 question f silent myocardial
infarction x 2 , history of hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin daily , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q day ,
Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg p.o. q day , toprol XL
50 mg p.o. q day , insulin 70/30 65/45 , Actos 45 q p.m , Avapro 300
mg p.o. q day , Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , sublingual nitroglycerin
p.r.n..
PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature 98.1 , blood pressure 116/70 , pulse 88 ,
primary care physician of 18. The patient appeared
to be in no acute distress. Jugular venous pressure approximately
13 cm water. LUNGS: Faint bibasilar rales. CARDIAC:
Tachycardia , regular rhythm without murmurs. ABDOMEN: Positive ,
normal active bowel sounds. Obese , distended and nontender.
EXTREMITIES: 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse , 2-3 plus edema
bilaterally to the knees.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular: It was felt that given notes
of thyroid dysfunction , his history was
consistent with fluid overload. His jugular venous pressure was
elevated and he had 3plus pitting edema to the knees without
significant rales on chest exam. He was aggressively diuresed with
doses of Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. IV as well as Zaroxolyn. Weight on
admission was 135 kilograms and on discharge he was down to 132
kilograms. A repeat echocardiogram at Ethool Hospital
showed an ejection fraction of 30-35 , left ventricular dimensions
of 47 mm , 1 plus mitral regurgitation and global hypokinesis as
well as moderate right ventricular dysfunction. Abdominal
ultrasound showed no ascites despite extremely distended abdomen
and right renal cyst x 2. Follow up abdominal CT also showed there
was no mass or ascites and his distended abdomen was likely due to
adipose tissue. Diuresis was limited by acute and chronic renal
failure and oliguria. Diuresis was held from March , 2001.
Right heart catheterization on February , 2001 showed mildly
elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and moderately elevated
right ventricular pressures. Dopamine was started on November ,
2001 to aid with renal perfusion and diuresis and he was then
weaned off of that on August , 2001. His Lasix was stopped on
August , 2001 and he auto-diuresed until the time of discharge
with stable blood pressure. He remained stable with no dyspnea at
rest and is symptom free at the time of discharge.
2. Renal: His basic chronic renal insufficiency is likely
secondary to poor diabetic control with a creatinine of 2.5 on March , 2001 , 3.3 at the time of admission. Acute renal failure with
increasing creatinine of 6 after aggressive diuresis with a mean of
0.8 percent. Renal function improved with creatinine of 4.1 on
August , 2001 with autodiuresis. The renal service was
consulted to comment on the nature of the patient's renal
insufficiency and acute renal failure as well as to assist in the
use of vasodilators.
3. Endocrine: He has a long standing history of type II diabetes
complicated by retinopathy and neuropathy and nephropathy. He was
maintained on his outpatient endocrine regimen during his stay.
The patient was discharged home with services. He is to follow up
with Dr. Marro on June , 2001 at 3:30 p.m. , with Dr. Loatman on
November , 2002 at 3:30 p.m. , Dr. Carcano March , 2001 at 10:00

p.o. q day , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
insulin 70/30 65 units q a.m. , insulin 70/30 45 units q p.m. ,
Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q day , Levaquin 250 mg p.o. q day for a
duration of 7 days , Actos 45 mg p.o. q p.m.
