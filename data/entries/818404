Discharge Date: 0/14/2002
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: LEFT HIP FRACTURE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. FAT EMBOLI SYNDROME.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. DECUBITUS ULCERS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lumadue is a 68-year-old man who
came in with a chief complaint of hip
pain after a mechanical fall. The patient had been hospitalized in
3/0 for ischemic right toes requiring debridement and amputation.
At that time , his hospital course was complicated by a non-Q wave
MI. Cardiology have recommended medical management with Lopressor
at that time and an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of
45%. Dobutamine MIBI revealed a severe fixed perfusion defect in
the inferoposterior and inferoseptal left ventricle without any
peri-infarct ischemia. Ejection fraction by MIBI imaging was 26%
in contrast to the echo results. The patient was ultimately
discharged on Lopressor , however , she stopped taking the Lopressor
for unclear reasons. For the few months prior to admission , he
developed increasing dyspnea on exertion with paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and increasing pedal edema , as well as nocturia , however ,
denied any orthopnea , any chest pain , fevers , melena , bright red
blood per rectum or palpitations. A few days prior to admission ,
the patient developed a dry cough and some rhinorrhea.
On the morning of admission , the patient sustained a mechanical
fall while trying to retrieve a newspaper. He had no
light-headedness , palpitations , pain in his chest , nausea or
vomiting , sweating or change in vision or sensory symptoms prior to
or after the fall. The patient fell onto his left side and
immediately developed left-sided leg and hip pain for which she
presented to the emergency room at Fentstraub Neycian's Medical Center .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy
( ischemic ) , peripheral vascular disease , 
status post amputation of right-sided toes , status post right
femoral to PT avascularization , diabetes type II , status post CVA , 
hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. , Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , glyburide 5 mg
p.o. q.d. , multivitamins , cough medicine p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: Aminoglycosides , unknown reaction.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of smoking one pack per
day x40 years , quit five years prior to admission.
He has one drink of liquor per day , lives at home alone in Targtine Highway , Birm , Vermont 21711 , and is in the insurance business.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for mother died of cancer at 74. Father
died at 55 of heart disease. Mother died at 50 of
a heart attack.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile , temperature 97.3 , 
heart rate 106 , blood pressure 162/77 , 
oxygenation 94% on room air. GENERAL: He was alert and oriented.
LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. PELVIS: Stable.
His left lower extremity had well-healed scars from donor site for
bypass grafting , strong dopplerable PT and DP pulses. His left leg
was externally rotated. Sensation was intact to light touch.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarb
19 , BUN 56 , creatinine 2.5. White count 12 , 
hematocrit 33 , platelets 388. PTT 40.5 , INR 1.2. EKG showed sinus
tach at 102 , with occasional PVCs , normal axis , normal intervals , 
no evidence of ischemia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary
edema. X-rays of his left pelvis and femur revealed fracture of
the left intertrochanter and subtrochanteric fracture with lesser
trochanteric fracture intact by 3 cm , less than five degrees
angulation. His femoral head was reduced.
IMPRESSION: A 68-year-old man with significant cardiac history
and vascular disease , status post left hip fracture
with mechanical fall , with pulmonary edema noted on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - Initially , the patient was
to be admitted to the orthopedic service with
medicine consult for wrist stratification. However , the patient
was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and
management. The patient was noted to have a troponin leak although
CK enzymes remained negative for ischemia. He had a MIBI performed
which revealed an unchanged fixed defect. He remained in sinus
tach with occasional PVCs and runs of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia lasting 3-4 beats at a time throughout his admission.
Sinus tach was attributed pain and discomfort , possibly with
element of hypoxia contributing as well. A troponin leak was
attributed to strain particularly in the setting of his
tachycardia. He was started on beta blocker , Ace inhibitor and
continued on an aspirin. He was aggressively diuresed with
afterload reduction. He was titrated upward as noted.
2. Pulmonary - The patient's crackles persisted on lung exam after
aggressive diuresis , prompting performance of a chest CT which
revealed an interstitial pattern with peripheral nodularity
consistent with fat emboli syndrome , positive component of
congestive heart failure and aspiration pneumonia as well. The
patient was continued on a regimen of Lasix for diuresis and was
treated for aspiration pneumonia as noted below. His oxygen
requirement diminished over a few days and he was maintained on two
liters of nasal cannula oxygen at the time of transfer to rehab.
3. Renal - The patient developed some renal failure in the setting
of diuresis , which improved with hydration. The patient
subsequently tolerated further diuresis with improvement in his
creatinine and it is possible that renal failure is due to fat
emboli syndrome as well and should improve slowly.
4. ID - The patient was treated with vancomycin , Flagyl and
levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia , course completed
5/6/02. The patient remained afebrile. His white blood count on
admission and discharge was 12.
5. Neurologically - The patient apparently had baseline mild
perfusion. The possibly worsened due to the fat embolic syndrome
and was at baseline prior to discharge per the patient's daughter.
6. Heme - The patient was continued on Lovenox 60 mg subcu. b.i.d.
for prophylaxis against DVT post-hip surgery to continue for six
months minimal followed by orthopedic surgery.
7. GI - The patient developed some diarrhea. C. diff. cultures
were negative to date at the time of discharge. The patient was
maintained on Nexium prophylaxis in the setting of his
anticoagulation.
8. Endocrine - The patient was restarted on oral hypoglycemics
prior to discharge in addition to sliding scale insulin. The
patient had a Foley and a triple lumen catheter , both of which were
removed on 5/6/02. The patient was evaluated by plastic surgery
for his peripheral vascular disease with ulcers. Recommended dry
sterile dressings to the right and left foot wound changed q.d.
with DuoDerm to the left lower leg wound to be changed q.3 days ,
with pressure sore prevention.
9. FEN - The patient was discharged on standing 20 mEq of K-Dur
q.d. It is likely to be checked q.o.d. to monitor for any further
requirements particularly in the setting of his runs of
nonsustained V-tach as noted above.
10. Ortho - The patient is followed daily by orthopedic surgery
and was discharged with staples on his left lower extremities to be
discontinued per orthopedic surgery recommendations in the future.
11. Disposition - The patient was stable for discharge to rehab on
8/18/02. He was to follow up with his primary care physician ,
orthopedic surgery , cardiology , and pulmonary medicine within the
next two weeks. His labs are to be drawn for a metabolic panel ,
magnesium and calcium q.o.d. for as long as the primary care
physician feels it is necessary with repletion of his electrolytes
as needed. He is to have physical therapy performed as needed.
His weightbearing status is non-weightbearing on the left lower
extremity and weightbearing as tolerated on his right lower
extremity per orthopedic surgery at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE DIET: ADA diet , low fat , low cholesterol , low salt.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , hold for
