HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 0/25/95 with concern
for her being at high risk of skin breakdown and
infection. Plans were made for panniculectomy , however , prior to
this procedure , she was admitted for IV Ancef t.i.d.; Hibiclenz
showers and sub-q Heparin. Preoperatively , her pulmonary function
was assessed and found to have an FEV-1 of 53% of predicted; FVC of
57% of predicted and an FEV-1/FVC of 93% of predicted. Chest x-ray
showed no active cardiopulmonary disease and an EKG showed a normal
sinus rhythm with a non specific T wave abnormality without change
since 1994. Her hematocrit preoperatively was 39.8 and her white
count was 9. A pulmonary consultation was also obtained because of
concern about her pulmonary status for the operation. On their
recommendation , the patient was treated with Azmacort inhalers ,
Albuterol nebulizer , and aggressive chest PT. On 0/13/95 , the
patient was taken to the operating room where a panniculectomy was
performed by Dr. Stanczyk , without any complications.
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the Co Wauhendprings Ton ICU , where
she continued to be intubated and on ventilatory support. On
postoperative day one , the patient was successfully extubated in
the morning , had 100% saturation on 40% face mask and she was
mobilized early with aggressive chest PT and deep breathing
encouragement stopped. The patient received two ( 2 ) units of
autologous red blood cells; after which her hematocrit was 32%.
Postoperative day two , the patient was found to have a hematocrit
down to 25.2 , likely due to re-equilibration and over the next two
days received two ( 2 ) units of blood with a hematocrit reaching
29%. Though she complained of light headiness prior to the
transfusion , afterwards she was up and walking without difficulty.
From postoperative day two , the patient was saturating at greater
than 93% on room air; had a wound that was clean and dry and intact
with serosanguineous drainage in the Jackson-Pratt drains and
showed no evidence of cellulitis , purulent drainage or fever , on IV
Ancef. On postoperative day five , two of the four Jackson-Pratt
drains were removed after their output fell below 30 ccs per day
and the patient was discharged in good condition on postoperative
day six with plans for home visiting nurse for dressing changes
