BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
***CC: Chest pain
***HPI: 52M pastor h/o NIDDM , HTN , hypercholesterolemia , and known
3-vessel CAD s/p NSTEMI ( 2002 ) w/ failed angioplasty to Marg1 occlusion ,
CYPHER stent to RCA ( 2003 ) , recurrent unstable angina w/ last cath ( 0/0 )
w/ diffuse CAD precluding CABG/PTCA but w/ patent RCA stent , last
perfusion stress ( 0/0 ) w/ moderate rev ischemia in Diag/PDA territories ,
ETT ( 6/10 ) w/ CP and ST depression in inferolateral leads , last Echo
( 0/0 ) w/ EF 55-60% no WMA , physically active at baseline p/w CP. At
8:45am pt first noticed left-sided substernal pain/pressure after
breakfast and coffee while walking to living room , well-circumscribed ,
4/10 intensity , constant , w/o radiation to jaw/arm/back , worse on deep
inspiration , w/ associated nausea and dizziness. Pt sat down w/ pain
2/10 , administered nitro spray x2 w/o relief , wife measured BP 158/90s
( usu 140/85 ). No other sx , but pt describes pain as similar but less
intense than that experienced in 2002 MI. Denies h/o CP since then
despite recently active baseline ( yesterday washing windows/ climbing
ladders , over last months doing cement work in church ) , but notes DOE
with walking 2 blocks uphill. Pt reports frequent prophylactic use of
nifedipine sprays immediately prior to exertion/activity.On 6/1/06 , pt
was evaluated for CABG by surgeon Dr. Ashley Starcher , who noted possible
candidacy for combined CABG/TMLR since diagonal likely too small to
bypass. Since pt was asymptomatic w/ nlm LVEF , he has remained on medical
therapy. Last visit to PCP Dr. Rob Holzinger at Thbull Carmonte Medical Center
on 11/29/06 was routine , and he is followed by cardiologist Dr. Heath Koerner

****ADMISSION CXR ( 8/10 ): nlm heart , clear lungs , no
PTX/edemaMicrobiology:UA , USed ( 8/10 ): WNL
****STUDIES:
-ETT MIBI: abnormal imaging - preliminary results showed that he stopped
after 5 minutes due to chest pain , 1mm ST depressions in inferior and
lateral leads , and mild ischemia in Diag1 territory which raises concern
for balanced ischemia.
****ASSESSMENT and PLAN:
52M pastor w/ unstable angina in setting of known 3-vessel CAD s/p stent
to RCA '03 last cath 3 of May w/ diffuse CAD precluding CABG/PTCA , medically
managed and asymptomatic until present. Vitals stable , enzymes negative ,
stress test with abnormal perfusion.
CV *ischemia* Known 3vd s/p stent. Rest chest pain. NSSTT
inferolaterally , Negative enzymes. Stress test prelim read shows
abnormal perfusion: stopped after 5 minutes due to chest pain , 1mm ST
depressions in inferior and lateral leads , mild ischemic in Diag1
territory which is concerning for "balanced ischemia" rather than an
improvement compared to previous nuclear imaging in 0/12 Inpatient cardiac
cathterization advised by medical
team but refused by pt. Pt. opts to be discharged and follow up for
elective cardiac catheterization on Tue 4/10 The risks of this plan were
discussed with him by his outpatient cardiologist , Dr. Marion Brzostowski
While an inpatient , patient was medically managed w/ ASA , hep gtt , statin ,
bb , acei. Lipid panel checked with TC 101 , tri 89 , HDL 41 , LDL 31. Statin
dose lowered for persistently high CK. Acei dose lowered as marginal BP
effect above ULN dose. Heparin gtt was discontinued prior to discharge.
On discharge , pt. instructed to take ASA , bb , acei , imdur , lipitor , zetia.
He was advised to discontinue metformin for 2 days before and 2 days
after cardiac catheterization. He was advised to be minimally active
and to call his physician or 911 if he experienced any further chest pain ,
shortness of breath , palpitations , lightheadedness or any other symptoms c
concerning to him.
*pump* Appears euvolemic. Nl EF. HTN controlled as above with bb , acei.
*rhythm* Sinus rhythm. Pt continued on home atenolol.
RENAL: *CRI* Possibly related to HTN/DM. Pt. w/ Cr 1.3 , within baseline.
ENDO: *DM* Metformin held. Pt. rx'ed w/ SSI. HgA1c checked and pending.
TSH also checked and pending.
PROPH: nexium/heparin gtt
CODE: FULL
DISPOSITION: Pt discharged to home with plans for elective outpatient
cardiac cathterization , cardiology , PCP f/u
DISCHARGE STATUS: afebrile P 50s-90s SBP 120s/70s sat RA
Exam w/o significant change from admission. Labs w/ Hct 40.2 , Cr 1.2
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted with chest pain. Your blood tests show that you did not
have a heart attack. You had a stress test which is concerning for regions
of your heart not receiving enough blood flow. The medical team
advised cardiac catheterization during this admission , but your plan is to
go home today and return for an elective outpatient cardiac catherization
on Tuesday 7/21 at 7:30am. Please go to the Admitting Office on the Ins to register. Do not eat anything after midnight Monday
night. Do not eat breakfast or drink liquids after midnight. Your
medications have been changed as follows: a ) stop
taking metformin for 2 days before and 2 days after your cardiac
catheterization b ) take lisinopril 40 mg daily instead of 80 mg daily
c ) take lipitor 40 mg daily instead of 80 mg daily. Do not do any
significant exertion until your cardiac catheterization. Call your doctor
or go to the ED if you experience any further chest pain , dizziness ,
palpitations , shortness of breath , or other symptoms concerning to you.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
PCP/cards:
-f/u official results of stress test
-f/u results of outpatient cardiac catheterization
( prehydration/mucomyst peri-cath )
-f/u results of HgA1c and TSH
