SERVICE:
General Medical Service Arb Gard Sa
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Pneumonia.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Pneumonia associated with PICC line bacteremia.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Diaphoresis and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Garrigan is a 68-year-old gentleman with known coronary artery
disease status post 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in
6/13 , hypertension , atrial fibrillation status post
cardioversion on Coumadin , hypercholesterolemia , aortic stenosis ,
status post aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic valve ,
diabetes mellitus , cervical stenosis , as well as a recent
admission to the Land As Rohay Hospital for bilateral
brachial plexopathy of unknown etiology , who is receiving three
weeks of intravenous cefotaxime as empiric Lyme treatment as a
possible cause for his plexopathy , who presents with shortness of
breath. While at the Sieu Iebri General Hospital , the
patient developed shortness of breath one-and-a-half day prior to
admission. This was associated with significant diaphoresis and
fevers intermittently for four days prior to admission. Of note ,
the patient denied any dysuria , cough , sinus pain , diarrhea , ear
pain , pleuritic chest pain , calf pain , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , or orthopnea. The patient was taken to the emergency
department where a chest x-ray demonstrated a new right upper
lobe pneumonia. The patient was treated with levofloxacin in the
emergency department and admitted to the inpatient medical
service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post 2-vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting in 4/10
2. Hypertension.
3. Atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion on Coumadin.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement
( bioprosthesis ).
6. Diabetes mellitus.
7. Bilateral brachial plexopathy of unknown etiology , but
attributed to Lyme disease. The patient was being treated four
with three weeks of IV cefotaxime. This brachial plexopathy had
improved to the point where the patient was able to lift his arms
and do his own ADLs. When he first presented with this
condition , the patient had a near complete paralysis of his motor
function in his upper extremities without loss of his sensory
function , per report.
8. Cervical stenosis and foraminal stenosis , as well as
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin 1000 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 500 mg p.o.
q.p.m. , simvastatin 5 mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ,
Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d. , which had been tapered down to 300 mg
q.d. , and then plan for discontinuation , Nexium 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,

weeks. He is married. Tobacco history , one-and-a-half packs per
day , smoking x40 years but has quit. No alcohol use. Over the
past seven years.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , afebrile , pulse 80s , blood
pressure 126/72 , and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters. General
appearance: Not acutely in distress , talking in full sentences ,
ruddy appearing in the face , but stable per the patient. Head
and neck exam revealed pupils that were equally round and
reactive to light. Extraocular movements were intact. No sinus
tenderness. JVP was around 9 cm , no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2 , 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the upper sternal border. Chest
exam: Bibasilar crackles and right-sided bronchial breath sounds
and question focal wheeze. Abdomen: Soft , nontender , and
nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. Extremities: No edema.
Warm and well perfused.
LABORATORY DATA:
Admission laboratory values included a Chem-7 within normal
limits with a creatinine of 0.8 and glucose of 181. White blood
cell count of 9.8 , hematocrit of 33.6 , and platelets of 222 with
a differential of 88% neutrophils. Liver function tests are
significant AST of 45 , ALT of 65 , alkaline phosphatase 153 , and
total bilirubin 0.5 , yet these liver function tests quickly
corrected the next morning of an AST of 21 , ALT of 47 , alkaline
phosphatase 123 , total bilirubin 0.5 , CK of 31 , CK-MB of 1.7 ,
troponin of less than assay , and amylase of 23. Chest x-ray
showing a right upper lobe wedge-shaped infiltrate , mild
cardiomegaly , and mild pulmonary edema. Electrocardiogram was
consistent with an old EKG from 2004 , normal sinus rhythm at 82 ,
now with slightly increased widening of the QRS complex in a left
bundle-branch block pattern , hyperacute T waves in V4 and V3.
IMPRESSION:
A 68-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems and
bilateral brachial plexopathy of unclear etiology , now improving ,
who presents with new right upper lobe infiltrate in the presence
of having an indwelling PICC line in place for IV antibiotics
over the past three weeks as well as a bioprosthetic valve.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious disease: The patient was admitted for likely
hospital-acquired pneumonia given his long hospitalization and
rehabilitation stays recently. The patient was pancultured. The
PICC line was discontinued and the tip was cultured. The patient
was covered broadly initially with vancomycin , as well as
ceftazidime. On further review of the culture data during the
hospital course , the patient began to grow coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus that was resistant to methicillin from both the
PICC line culture , as well his blood cultures from 10/13/05. His
chest CT was significant for an extensive area of ground glass
opacity in the right upper lobe with smaller areas in other
lobes. Bilateral mediastinal adenopathy was noted. Infection
was thought to be the most likely diagnosis in view of the
rapidity of the chest film changes. Other possibilities included
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma or lymphoma per the radiologic
read , but was not consistent with the clinical presentation. Per
infectious disease consultation , the pneumonia could be
attributed to the MRSE PICC line bacteremia with secondary
seating. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction of 55%-60% , but with abnormal paradoxical
motion consistent with his postoperative status after aortic
valve replacement. The entire anterior wall was hypokinetic.
The right ventricular systolic function appeared to be normal.
The left atrial size was mildly dilated at 4.6 cm. The aortic
valve appeared to be normal functioning with trace aortic
regurgitation. Other valvular function appeared to be within
normal limits with exception of moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation and peak systolic pulmonary artery pressures of 31
mmHg plus right atrial pressure. No pericardial effusion was
seen and no evidence of endocarditis was observed. On follow up
chest x-rays throughout the hospital course , the patient's
infiltrate resolved with a chest x-ray on 9/16/05 showing clear
lungs and only prior cardiac surgery evident without worsening or
continued presence of the right upper lobe infiltrate. A new
PICC line was placed per infectious disease service
recommendations for continued intravenous treatment with
vancomycin for 7 to 10 days starting 48 hours after the last
blood culture was negative. Therefore , the last dose of his IV
antibiotics should be given on 2/13/05. To cover other
gram-negative sources for his pneumonia , the Infectious Disease
Service also suggested continuing and ceftazidime treatment as
well. Therefore , the patient will be discharged on both
intravenous vancomycin as well as intravenous ceftazidime
treatment. Because of the patient's inability to pay for the
visiting nurses to administer IV antibiotics at home , the patient
will be discharged to a rehabilitation center.
2. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: Given the patient's history of diabetes and shortness
of breath , the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction
with three negative cardiac enzymes. The patient was continued
on his anti-ischemic regimen including aspirin , statin , as well
as beta blockade. In the future , the patient should be
transitioned back to once a day dosing of beta blockade as an
outpatient.
Pump: The patient initially presented in mild volume overload.
The patient was maintained on his home dosing of Lasix with good
volume response. By the end of his hospitalization , the patient
was not requiring any oxygen supplementally and was discharged
with euvolemia.
Rhythm: The patient was admitted initially in normal sinus
rhythm status post cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. He
remained on Coumadin. He was placed on telemetry given some
increased widened intervals of his QRS complexes. Early in the
course of his hospitalization , the patient converted back to
atrial fibrillation. His rate was controlled with beta blockade.
The Sternta Center And was asked to comment. The patient
was maintained on both beta blockade as well as digoxin. He also
continued on anticoagulation with Coumadin. Interestingly , the
Cardiovascular Service suggested that possibly some ground-glass
opacities on the patient's chest CT could be attributed to
amiodarone lung toxicity. Because of this finding , it was
recommended that the patient stop the amiodarone , which was
indeed discontinued through this hospitalization. He should
follow up with his cardiovascular group as an outpatient to
determine further course of treatment for his atrial
fibrillation.
Anticoagulation: The patient will continue to be treated with
Coumadin for goal INR between 2 to 3. By the end of this
hospitalization , the patient's INR was 1.7 on a dose of Coumadin
7 mg p.o. q.h.s. That dose was increased to 7.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
The patient should have his INR checked within two days after
discharge and have his Coumadin dose changed appropriately.
3. Neurologic: The patient was admitted on a previous
hospitalization with a history of bilateral brachioplexopathy.
It had been attributed to possible line infection given a history
of a tick bite. He was treated empirically with three weeks of
IV cefotaxime with moderate improvement of motor function while
at rehabilitation. Interestingly , upon further review of Lyme
disease workup , the patient apparently had a negative serology
for Treponema pallidum IgG. Confirmatory tests , which included a
Lyme disease titer was still marked as pending in our computer
system at the Ardbroo Worth-son Bu Elstownw. Raph Hospitals . Despite multiple
attempts to try to contact the laboratory , which runs this
particular tests , we were unable to confirm or deny the presence
of past Lyme infection. Therefore , at this time , we can only
state that his bilateral brachioplexopathy was secondary to an
unknown and unclear etiology. Fortunately , with physical therapy
and with time and possibly with infusion of the IV cefotaxime ,
the patient's motor function has improved. At the time of this
discharge , the patient's overall upper extremity motor strength
was 4+/5 symmetrically. The patient should follow up very
closely with his primary care physician as well as his
neurologist in one month. At that time , his neurologist should
confirm or negate the possibility that the patient's neurologic
symptoms may have been caused by Lyme disease. The patient
should continue physical therapy at rehabilitation and as an
outpatient. In addition , the patient should continue his
Neurontin taper. He currently is on 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. and
should be tapered to nothing by the end of his hospitalization
and rehabilitation. He will continue on methadone for his
chronic pain. In addition , he suffers from significant anxiety.
He will be discharged on p.r.n. Ativan at low-dose , as higher
doses tend to make him sleepier and oversedated.
4. Endocrine: The patient was admitted with diabetes mellitus.
He was initially admitted with taking metformin 1000 mg p.o.
q.a.m. and 500 mg p.o. q.h.s. Because of his hospitalization and
multiple studies , this was discontinued transiently and he was
placed on a regular insulin sliding scale. At the end of this
hospitalization , he will be placed back on those home doses of
metformin. In addition , he will continue his ACE inhibitor for
his diabetes , as well as for his significant cardiac disease.
5. Pulmonary: Much of his pulmonary process can be attributed
to his pneumonia as treated in the statements above. In
addition , he will continue on p.r.n. Atrovent and albuterol
nebulizer treatment for possible wheezing during his
hospitalization. In addition , it is hoped that the Ativan p.r.n.
dosing also contribute to less subjective shortness of breath
secondary to alleviation of his anxiety.
6. Gastrointestinal: The patient , periodically , throughout his
hospitalization complained of mild epigastric pain. A KUB showed
no perforation and no obvious obstruction , but with many loops of
bowel with stool. He was placed on a bowel regimen including
Colace , senna , and Dulcolax p.r.n. By the end of this
hospitalization , he appeared to be less symptomatic. In
addition , he will continue his trial of simethicone p.r.n. for
abdominal gas and bloating. He will continue on his proton pump
inhibitor , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d.
CODE STATUS:
He remains full code throughout his hospitalization.
DISPOSITION:
The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation where he will
continue IV antibiotic support for until 2/13/05. He should
also continue physical therapy for his upper extremity motor
dysfunction. He should follow up with his primary care physician
as well as his neurologist as stated in his discharge summary.
