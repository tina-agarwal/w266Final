first postop day. There were no problems discontinuing the IABP
and despite his peripheral vascular disease there was no problem
with the balloon pump. He continued to progress satisfactorily ,
was transferred to the Stepdown Unit , and was transferred to the
floor. He was placed back on his medication and he did have some
trouble swallowing postop but he had undergone an upper GI series
two weeks prior to his procedure which was read as normal. The
rest of his postop course was uneventful. His incisions healed
quite nicely and he was discharged on postop day six. His blood
