ATTENDING: IWANEJKO , COLLIN M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: Anaphylaxis.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
5. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6. Diabetic retinopathy.
7. Urinary tract infection.
8. Adrenal insufficiency.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old female
with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica for which she takes
steroids and has developed adrenal insufficiency. She presented
to the emergency room with shortness of breath , wheezing , and a
maculopapular rash after receiving the pneumovax shot. She
received this shot upon discharge from admission to the Baybell Lolic Hospital for syncope and dehydration. The treatment there
was IV fluids in short course and increase in her steroids. In
the emergency room , she was treated with steroids , Benadryl , and
Pepcid.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Immunology: The patient was found to have anaphylactic
reaction to the Pneumovax shot that she received. Her
symptoms resolved by hospital day #1 after receiving IV Benadryl
around the clock , Pepcid , and an increased dose in her Hydrocort
to 100 mg IV q.6h. The steroids were started on a taper and on
the night of the first admission , the patient was noted to have increased
shortness of breath and
oxygen requirements. She was treated with oxygen and increased
steroids again for presumed reexacerbation of anaphylaxis.
2. Pulmonary: The episode of wheezing that she had on the first
day of admission could also be partly explained by fluid
overload. By hospital day #2 , she had developed crackles and
jugular venous distention. She has a history of diastolic heart
dysfunction , and diuresis was initiated. Despite receiving 3
doses of IV Lasix , she had an episode of flash pulmonary edema on the
second night of hospitalization. A chest x-ray was obtained at
that time which was consistent with pulmonary edema. She was
stabilized with additional Lasix and 100% nonrebreather mask , and
nitroglycerin. Her blood pressure was 200 systolic at that time.
The plan for continued diuresis was interrupted on hospital day
#3 when she became hypotensive and febrile with a UA consistent with infection.
She was started on Levo for presumed urosepsis.
On hospital day #4 , diuresis was resumed as her blood pressure
stabilized around 110 , and she still had a 5-6L oxygen requirement. The
patient reports her dry weight is 140 to 143 lbs. Her
primary care doctor suspects it more like 149 lbs. She is
currently receiving diuresis to wean oxygen requirement and is
down to 1 L per nasal cannula. Her goal fluid status is to
negative 1 L per day , and she continues to receive Lasix IV to
meet that goal.
She was also restarted on p.o. Lasix 30 mg p.o. daily. There
was some concern about aspiration by the nursing staff. She
immediately had trouble with swallowing liquids and Speech and
Swallow was consulted. The patient failed the bedside swallow
exam and so a video swallow was obtained , which actually showed
no evidence of aspiration , and so she was continued on a regular
diet. By the time of discharge she did not require any oxygen. She would
intermittently desat to the high 80s , which would quickly resolve with deep
breathing or chest PT.
3. Endocrinology. The patient has a history of PMR and adrenal
insufficiency , on 30 mg of Hydrocort daily at home. On the
March , 2005 , in the setting of urosepsis she was placed back on stress
dose steroids which was then tapered back to her home dose throughout the
rest of her hospitalization. She has a history of
diabetes type 2 requiring insulin inhouse or oral agents. Oral
agents were held and insulin was given for glucose control , NPH
30 units in the morning and 10 units in the evening seemed to
control the a.m. and p.m. sugars pretty well. Regular insulin
was added 6 units in the morning with breakfast with the morning
NPH for 1 p.m. blood sugar control , as this was the highest blood
sugar daily. Obviously , this needs to be monitored and adjusted
as needed as well the medicine staff is going to be following her
as to whether she should resume the oral agents. She does on
occasion drop her blood sugar to 50 or 60 , which is usually
asymptomatic.
4. Renal: Her baseline creatinine was 1.0. Both her BUN and
creatinine were elevated with diuresis. Her creatinine needs to
be monitored closely and medications need to renally dosed.
5. Infectious Disease: Her urine was positive for greater than
100 , 000 group B hemolytic Streptococci and she was initially
started with Levaquin. It was switched to penicillin on March , 2005 , after the gram-positive organism was discovered and she
was switched back to Levaquin after the sensitivities came back ,
and it was sensitive to Levaquin. The Levaquin is ideal because
her coughing could also represent bronchitis. She has complained
of a cough since weeks before admission , which is now resolving.
6. Disposition: The patient does not feel that she can care for
 herself at home and screening was placed to Er Medical Center , and that was accepted for the acute care center
for Saturday , January , 2005.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is just to follow up with
primary care physician. She should also follow up with Dr.
Wann from Pulmonary at the Reddis Hospital University Of An
appointment will be made for her. She should return to the
emergency room if she experiences chest pain , further shortness
of breath , severe sweating , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , or
other concerns.
LABORATORY DATA: On discharge , glucose 116 , BUN 30 , creatinine
1.3 , sodium 139 , potassium 3.4; please make a note that her
potassium requires repletion and should be monitored; chloride
93 , CO2 33 , CK 34 , calcium 8.7 , magnesium 1.8 , troponin less than
assay. White blood cell count is 7.04 , hemoglobin 10.6 ,
hematocrit 32.8 , and platelet 274 , 000. Urinalysis , greater than
100 , 000 with 4+ beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group B , sensitive
to penicillin and Cipro; with Cipro being a better choice , i.e. ,
levofloxacin because of her bronchitis.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
See radiologic data. Swallowing study on August , 2005 ,
showed normal video swallow. Portable chest x-ray on March ,
2005 , showed new bilateral perihilar opacification consistent
with pulmonary edema. Minimal left-sided effusion is present and
there are no pneumothoraces. The heart is normal in size.
