ADDENDUM
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Neuro: Starting on 7/0/06 the patient had an episode of
agitation on hemodialysis where he received Ativan and continued
to be agitated and required multiple code greys to sedate him. A
team meeting was held on 3/25/06 and per psychiatry
recommendations the patient was started on 250 mg b.i.d. of
Depakote , Haldol was reduced to just Monday-Wednesday-Friday 1 mg
before hemodialysis and 1 mg p.r.n. agitation. The patient did
very well on this regimen and his Depakote level was stable at
39.7 on discharge. The plan is to continue Depakote b.i.d. 250
mg with Haldol p.r.n. for behavior. In terms of his mental
status on discharge , the patient was A&amp;O x3 and appropriate.
In terms of cardiac , there were no additional events to report.
In terms of pulmonary , the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia
on 0/16/06 and started on ceftriaxone IV and Flagyl. This was
changed to cefpodoxime and Flagyl for discharge. In terms of his
pneumonia that was evident right lower lobe pneumonia on chest
x-ray and the patient was also spiking fevers and had audible
rales on exam.
In terms of GI , the patient continued tolerate regular diet and
nutrition continued to follow ensuring adequate p.o. intake and
adjusting diet per endocrine needs.
In terms of endocrine , the addendum to 7/0/06 , the patient
ultimately discontinued on a regimen of 7 units of Lantus q.a.m.
and q.p.m. with 5 units aspart q.a.c. breakfast and lunch and 4
units of aspart q.a.c. dinner. His sliding scale was very light
and he is only to be covered with one to two units of aspart
during the night as insulin stacks in this patient very easily.
It was recommended if the patient is noted to be in the low 100s
consistently through the course of the day that his next dose of
aspart be either halved or held as the patient easily becomes
hypoglycemic and is unable to recognize the symptoms of
hypoglycemia himself. At the time of discharge , the patient's
fingersticks were well controlled in the 100-200 range.
In terms of ID , the patient began to spike fevers on 11/29/06
with a T. max of 100.6 and blood cultures failed to show anything
as did sputum cultures. On 9/2/06 , the patient spiked to 101.2
and had evidence of pneumonia on his chest x-ray. He was started
on antibiotics of ceftriaxone and Flagyl , which was switched to
cefpodoxime and Flagyl for discharge. The cefpodoxime should be
dosed after dialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday.
In terms of disposition , the patient has been discharged to rehab
where he will continue hemodialysis on Monday-Wednesday-Friday
and continues to have the same medication Rx as he did well in
house. Specific care should be given to his insulin regimen as
well as his behavior control and nutrition as noted in the
discharge instructions. Again please c.c. Dr. Donte Tasker , Dr.
Byron Hague , Dr. Bolin on this discharge summary.
