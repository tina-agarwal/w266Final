Discharge Date: 3/19/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76 year old woman who
had a two vessel coronary artery
bypass graft on 3/7/97. She was discharged to home on 5/4/97 to
Diand Leb Hospital Hospital And Hospital where she developed
epigastric discomfort and recurrent atrial fibrillation and was
transferred back to Landso Souwalt Medical Center .
Her cardiac history dates back to March of 1995 when she was
admitted to Kassi Rehabilitation Hospital for an asthma flare. At that
time she ruled out for a myocardial infarction. Her CKs were
negative. An exercise test at that time showed she was able to go
eight minutes on a Bruce protocol with 2 mm ST depressions in leads
2 , 3 , and F. A MIBI showed a small reversible defect inferiorly
and she was managed medically at that time.
In February of 1996 she was again admitted to Lita Hospital with chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. She was started on Prilosec for presumed
gastroesophageal reflux disease. In July of 1996 an exercise
Thallium test showed she went eight minutes on a Bruce protocol
with a heart rate of 125 , blood pressure 170/80 , and no ECG
changes. She stopped secondary to chest pain.
From 10/12/97 through 2/23/97 she presented with chest pressure at
rest which radiated to her shoulders and jaw. On presentation she
was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation. An ECG at that time
showed elevated T-waves in V1 and V2. She was treated with
Lopressor with slowing of the rate and relief of her chest pain.
She ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 473 with
an MB fraction of 32. Her Lopressor was changed to Verapamil
secondary to increased wheezing requiring nebulizers. The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed
an left anterior descending artery that had 70% proximal lesion
with collaterals , left circumflex artery with long 80 to 90%
stenosis , right coronary artery 30 to 40% stenosis , left ventricle
with ejection fraction of 58% , and apical akinesis. She
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. Following
catheterization the patient agreed to a coronary artery bypass
graft but the procedure was postponed until she received Epogen
therapy since she is a Jehovah's Witness. She was discharged in
sinus rhythm.
She returned on 5/3/97 and underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times two which was complicated by a perioperative myocardial
infarction with inferior ST elevations and peak CK of 386 and MB
fraction of 8.1. Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with
Verapamil. The patient was loaded on Digoxin and had multiple
episodes of atrial fibrillation. She converted to normal sinus
rhythm and was discharged to rehabilitation on 5/4/97 in normal
sinus rhythm.
Her postoperative course was notable for gastrointestinal distress
with epigastric burning , reflux , nausea , vomiting , and
constipation. On 5/4/97 at rehabilitation the patient noted
worsening epigastric burning with a sour taste in her mouth. This
was relieved with Maalox. She was awakened from sleep with
epigastric burning radiating to the right back and palpitations.
ECG showed rapid atrial fibrillation at a rate of 125 to 150 and
she was treated with Verapamil 2.5 mg IV times two and converted to
normal sinus rhythm. The patient was noted to have ST elevations
of 1 mm in 1 , 3 , and F and she was transferred to Yacull Hospital for further evaluation. She had no complaint of shortness
of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , syncope , or
presyncope. At Vero Medical Center she was noted to have
epigastric burning similar to a prior episode and was treated with
Maalox with relief.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was lying in bed in no apparent
distress. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx benign.
Neck: Supple. Full range of motion. No lymphadenopathy.
Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP 8 cm. Heart: No heave and no
thrill. Regular rate. S1 , split S2. 2/6 systolic murmur at apex.
Positive for frictional rub. Lungs clear to auscultation. No
wheeze or rhonchi. Chest had midline sternotomy without any
exudate or erythema. Sternum was stable. Back: No costovertebral
angle tenderness. Abdomen: Keloid in right upper quadrant. Soft ,
nontender , nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: No
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. Neurologic: Alert and oriented
times three. Cranial nerves II - XII intact. Intact sensation and
strength throughout. Reflexes symmetric and toes downgoing.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 129 , potassium 5.4 , creatinine 1.0 , BUN
20 , glucose 227. Digoxin level 2.6. Hematocrit
45.1 , WBC 9.2. Her triponin-1 level was 0.7. ECG at Aifield Sum Taning Healthcare Center was in normal sinus rhythm. Normal left axis ,
normal intervals. 0.16 , 0.88 , 0.36. Rate of 85. Left atrial
enlargement. 1 mm ST depressions in 1 and 2 which is consistent
with Digoxin effect. 1 mm upsloping ST elevations in 2 , 3 , and F
unchanged from prior ECG on 7/10/97. Chest x-ray showed mediastinal
shadow. Stable with question of atelectasis at left base.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction
and her chest burning was primarily due to
gastrointestinal reflux which was relieved with Maalox , as well as
chest discomfort in her left shoulder which was due to
musculoskeletal pain and was relieved with Tylenol and Percocet or
Darvocet. On monitor she showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation
although she did have supraventricular tachycardia and one incident
of a ten-beat run. In light of the fact that the patient is a
Jehovah's Witness and is not a candidate for being Coumadinized for
episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation , it was felt that we would
use the anti-arrhythmic agent , Propafenone , to prevent episodes in
the perioperative period of atrial fibrillation. Her Digoxin was
discontinued and she tolerated Propafenone load of 150 mg t.i.d.
well along with her Verapamil dose.
Other issues during this admission were that her blood sugar was
high requiring sliding scale of insulin. Also the patient had
hyponatremia with sodium in the high 120s and low 130s throughout
her stay , as well as a potassium which was mildly elevated , ranging
from 5.0 to 5.8. Cortisol levels were drawn and results are
pending for possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The question of
a renal tubular acidosis type IV was raised.
Throughout the admission her chest burning was well controlled with
Maalox. Her Pepcid dose was increased to 20 mg b.i.d.
Helicobacter pylori and IgG antibodies were sent and results are
pending. Her musculoskeletal pain which is primarily in her left
shoulder radiating to her arm has been well controlled with
Tylenol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary history as above ,
asthma which has required hospitalization in
the past but no intubations , adult-onset diabetes mellitus for
which she takes Micronase , hypertension , gastroesophageal reflux
disease , hypercholesterolemia , status post cholecystectomy , left
lower lobe granuloma followed by chest CT scan , and cataracts.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4h , Albuterol inhaler
2 puffs q.i.d. , Ecasa 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Beclovent 2 sprays t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Epogen 10 , 000
units subcu three times a week , Gliburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Mevacor
20 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Propafenone 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Verapamil SR 120 mg p.o. q.d.
ALLERGIES: Beta blockers and Lisinopril. It is questionable
whether she has allergy to Naprosyn as well.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives at home with her daughter. No alcohol.
No tobacco.
DISPOSITION: The patient is being discharged to On Medical Center She will likely require a
short course of physical therapy and rehabilitation and will be
returning to home following her course of rehabilitation.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow-up in the future with her primary care
physician , Dr. Ruacho , as well as with her cardiologist , Dr.
Ciccarello CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is stable on the day
of discharge.
