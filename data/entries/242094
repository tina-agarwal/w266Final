to the left. Strength 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities.
Sensation and reflexes symmetric and equal. Pulses 2+
bilaterally at carotids , radials , femorals and PTs , present by

upper extremities both normal.
PREOPERATIVE LABS: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 101 ,
bicarb 29 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 298. White blood cell
count 6.0 , hematocrit 42.9 , hemoglobin 13.8 , platelets 237 , 000 ,
PT 15.9 , INR 1.3 , PTT 29.6. Urinalysis was normal.
CAROTID IMAGING: The patient had less than 25% stenosis of the
right internal and left internal carotid arteries. MR angiogram
of the left internal carotid artery showed 60% occlusion and 50%
occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac
catheterization performed on 2/8/06 at Kan Hospital revealed 100% ostial LAD stenosis , 100% proximal
circumflex stenosis , 70% ostial left main stenosis , 75% mid RCA
stenosis , 50% proximal RT LV-BR stenosis , and proximal stenosis of the
right PDA. CABG grafts from prior bypass surgery were all
patent.
Echocardiogram on 1/16/06 showed an ejection fraction of 60% ,
aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 38 mmHg and peak gradient
of 67 mmHg , calculated valve area was estimated at 0.7 sq cm.
There was mild mitral valve insufficiency. An EKG on 9/19/06
showed first-degree AV block with a heart rate of 62 and inverted
T waves in leads I , aVL and V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray on 9/14/06 was consistent with congestive heart
failure and revealed aortic calcifications and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 9/14/06 for
completion of his preoperative workup. He was brought to the
operating room on 1/26/06 where Dr. Luangrath performed a reoperative
sternotomy and a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement
using a 23-mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve. The
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 186 minutes and the aortic
cross-clamp time was 77 minutes. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. Over
the next few days , the patient was extubated. He had episodes of
uncontrolled hypertension and was placed on a nitroglycerin drip.
By postoperative day #4 , the patient had been weaned off his
drips and his blood pressure was well controlled. He had been
hemodynamically stable and afebrile in the Intensive Care Unit.
He was ready for transfer to the regular hospital floor for the
remainder of his recovery. At that point , the patient demonstrated
postoperative confusion , particularly at night. The
patient's neurological exam was otherwise normal. The patient
was started on cardiac medications including captopril , Lopressor
and aspirin. He had been extubated without complication and was
oxygenating well with the support of 1 liter of oxygen via nasal
cannula. He had no respiratory issues. The patient was seen by
the Speech and Swallow Service for his history of dysphagia and
was cleared for mechanical soft diet with nectar-thick liquids
and crushed pills. The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated.
He exhibited adequate urine output with diuretics
postoperatively for fluid retention. The patient was followed by
the Diabetes Management Service in the postoperative period for
his history of diabetes. He was initially on an insulin drip and
then weaned to a NovoLog sliding scale with supplemental Lantus
insulin in the evenings. The patient's hematocrit had dropped to
22 on postoperative operative day #3 and he was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit
bumped to 26. On postoperative days #4 through #6 , the patient
continued his slow steady progress. The neurology team who had
visited him after surgery after his mental status changes
recommended holding his Sinemet and only to restart if his
Parkinson symptoms reoccur. Otherwise , the patient
experienced some hypertension and his blood pressure medications
were titrated accordingly. The patient remained in a sinus
rhythm. By postoperative day #6 , his blood pressure was stable.
He was oxygenating well on room air and was ambulating
comfortably in the halls. He had a sitter accompany him in his
room for impulsivity , however , this became unnecessary after
postoperative day #6. A PA and lateral chest x-ray looked clear
with no infiltrates and no pneumothorax. He had returned to his
baseline mental status and he was deemed ready for discharge to
the rehabilitation facility , which is owned by his daughter.
On the day of discharge , the patient's vital signs were
temperature 97.7 degrees , heart rate 65 in sinus rhythm , blood
pressure 104/60 , O2 saturation 97% on room air. Respiratory rate
20. The patient was still several kilograms above his
preoperative weight. A urinalysis had suggested a low-level
infection and his urine culture was growing proteus 5000 CFUs and
he was started on a seven day course of ciprofloxacin.
LABORATORY DATA: On the day of discharge , sodium 143 , potassium
4.2 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 34 , BUN 33 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 102 , magnesium 2.4 , white blood cell count 11.6 ,
hematocrit 28.0 , hemoglobin 9.1 , platelets 297 , 000. PT 16.2 , INR
1.3 , PTT 28.1.
