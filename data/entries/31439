Discharge Date: 2/18/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) MITRAL REGURGITATION.
PROCEDURE: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT TIMES FOUR AND MITRAL
VALVE REPAIR ON March , 1999 BY DR. CORNELIUS RISIEN .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45 year-old woman who
was a patient on the Medicine Service ,
admitted on May , 1999 for cardiac evaluation prior to renal
transplant. She had known end stage renal disease. She was
dialysis dependent since 1995 except for two years between 1997 and
1999 , through which time she had a prior transplant. In addition ,
she has hypertension , diabetes mellitus times 22 years , insulin
dependent , status post cardiac arrest from hypercalcemia in 1999 ,
peripheral vascular disease and claudication and a known
echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 30%. She has a
history of atrial flutter controlled on Amiodarone. At the present
time , a cardiac catheterization performed on May , 1999 showed
left main disease tapering at 40% , LAD disease at 40-45% in the mid
vessel , circumflex disease at 60% proximally and 70-80% in the mid
vessels and right coronary artery proximal to middle disease at
40-60%. An Adenosine MIBI on March , 1999 showed evidence of an
old infarct inferolaterally with severe ischemia elsewhere.
Echocardiogram here at this institution showed an ejection fraction
of 40% with global hypokinesis and severe lateral hypokinesis with
2+ mitral regurgitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , end stage renal disease since
1995 , status post transplant in 1997 with
rejection in 1999 , status post fistula in the right arm , insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus times 21 years with chronic renal
insufficiency and diabetic retinopathy , status post laparoscopic
cholecystectomy , status post dilatation and curettage , coronary
artery disease as above.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Cozaar 50 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Prilosec. 3 ) Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.
day. 4 ) Insulin sliding scale. 5 ) Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , she is afebrile
with hemodynamics normal on room air. She
is a well appearing , swollen , obese woman in no acute distress.
She had normal dentition. She had no carotid bruits and no jugular
venous distension. Chest is clear bilaterally without rales.
Heart is regular with a two out of six systolic ejection murmur and
no gallops. Abdomen is obese , benign with a left lower quadrant
incision , status post transplant nephrectomy. Peripheral vascular
examination demonstrates palpable radial and axillary pulses , 1+
palpable femoral pulses and a barely palpable dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses , both of which were monophasic doppler
signals.
LABORATORY: Preoperative creatinine pre-hemodialysis was 6.7 and
hematocrit was 34.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery
Service from the Medicine Service on March ,
1999 after she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times four
and mitral valve repair. The patient tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit for
postoperative care. She underwent dialysis on postoperative day
number one and was extubated after dialysis with a clearing of her
anesthetic medications and paralytic indications. She required
some inotropic support in the immediate postoperative period. She
was gradually weaned from her pressure requirement after
extubation. Coumadin was begun given her history of mitral valve
repair. Nutrition was consulted for lack of appetite. She did
well on her dialysis and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four. Echocardiogram was obtained which
was normal. The patient had an otherwise unremarkable
postoperative course which was somewhat slower than average based
on her severe medical problems and need for dialysis. Her chest
tubes were discontinued on postoperative day number three as well
as her epicardial wires without problems. At the time of discharge
dictation , she is ambulating independently , tolerating a renal diet
on no supplemental oxygen.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Dobis in six
weeks. She will follow-up with her cardiologist in one
to two weeks and she will follow-up with the Renal Team in one to
two weeks.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2 )
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3 )
Coumadin to be dosed based on the recommendations of her Coumadin
Service with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5. 4 ) Celebrex 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. which was added by another physician.
