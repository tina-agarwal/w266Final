****************Hospital Course******************
61yoF with h/o DM , gout , CRI here with an inflammatory polyarthritis
of the left hand/wrist with overlying swelling. No evidence of
systemic illness at this time. Most likely etiology is gout , given lack
of other clinical signs or risk factors for septic joint.
1. RHEUM: Patient refused left wrist tap. She was followed closely by
rheumatology , who recommended starting steroids and continuing colchicine
for sx relief. Colchicine was decreased to 0.6mg qod given renal
function. Patient was discharged home to finish 1 week steroid taper. At
time of discharge , hand pain and swelling was mildly improved.
2. ID: no signs of septic joint.
3. HEME: Patient was continued on home coumadin.
4. RENAL: Cr at 2.3 near baseline , renally dose medications
5. ENDO: Patient was admitted with hyperglycemia , no evidence of HONK ,
likely related to infection. Hyperglycemia was further worsened by
administration of steroids , as expected. Patient's insulin requirements
were quantified and standing novolog increased qAC in addition to sliding
scale. Lantus was continued at home dose. Blood glucose was under
improved control at time of discharge. Patient was discharged home with
home lantus/novolog with a sliding scale written out for her. She will
have VNA to help her with glucose management. Thyroid replacement was
continued.
