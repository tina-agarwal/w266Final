Discharge Date: 5/16/1996
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 71 year old gentleman with a
history of severe coronary artery disease who
presented with unstable angina with probable mesenteric ischemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Cardiac risk factors include a history
of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,
remote history of smoking , questionable positive family history ,
and no diabetes mellitus. The patient has had a history of
coronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. In the 1970s the patient had a myocardial infarction
number 1 and in 1992 he had his second myocardial infarction , non Q
wave MI , refused catheterization. ETT was done and he was treated
with Atenolol and Isordil. In 2/25/93 the patient had an anterior
myocardial infarction and subsequently had a V-tach , V-fib arrest ,
converted with 200 joules at Mid-ma Hospital and received TPA ,
heparin , Lidocaine , and his peak CPK value was 7975. Echo revealed
an ejection fraction of 20% with anterior apical akinesis , left
atrial enlargement. The course was complicated by post MI chest
pain. On 4/17/93 the patient was transferred to Rahfletchgreenesouth Rehabilitation Hospital Of Cardiac catheterization at that point revealed 90% LAD
lesion and 100% PDA lesion , 90% D1 lesion , and the patient had PTCA
of LAD to a remaining 40% lesion and D1 PTCA with 40% residual.
Post PTCA course was complicated by flash pulmonary edema and
anterior ST elevation which led to emergent cath which revealed a
70% LAD , 100% D1 lesion , and this re-occlusion was treated with
repeat PTCA of LAD and intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient was
given Captopril and Lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Since then ,
the patient was medically managed and in his usual state of health
without any chest pain for the two years until about three days
prior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain ,
epigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for
4-6 hour episodes. Occasionally the patient was awaken from sleep.
He denied orthopnea , PND , edema. The patient's pain was similar
to but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. The patient
denied chest pain. On 9/17/96 , the patient was seen by Dr. Mcgray
of PVH . The patient continued to have abdominal pain. Patient
had CHF on examination. An EKG revealed new lateral T wave
changes. The patient was sent to Tanjuan Tialan Vition Hospital and there the
patient became diaphoretic , was short of breath , improved with
nitroglycerin and therefore was transferred to Bert Stern Medical Center
In the Emergency Room , the patient had shortness of breath , blood
pressure elevated to 210/110 , heart rate of 118 , continued to have
abdominal pain and development of chest pain typical of angina. He
received Lopressor , IV TNG , aspirin , no heparin secondary to
increased INR to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequently
improved. Chest pain resolved. His EKG had T wave inversions in
V5 through V6.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Significant for coronary artery disease
as above. Status post multiple myocardial
infarctions. PTCA of LAD. 2. Peptic ulcer disease. 3.
Hypertension. 4. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Status post
amputation of right third distal phalanx. 6. History of
nephrolithiasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 3 mg q.h.s. , Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.day , Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Mevacor
20 mg p.o. q.day , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Nitro patch , and
sublingual nitroglycerin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with brother. Retired heavy
equipment operator. He smoked 15 pack years and
quit twenty years ago. Alcohol occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive coronary artery disease in two sisters
with myocardial infarctions.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature of 98 , heart rate of 72 , blood
pressure of 104/68 , respiratory rate of 16.
Oxygen saturation of 97%. HEENT examination revealed no JVD.
Cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border. Chest was
soft bibasilar crackles. Abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. A ventral hernia was present
which was easily reducible. Extremities showed no cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. Neuro examination was nonfocal. Rectal was
guaiac negative per the Emergency Ward.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium of 144 , potassium of 3.5. He had a
hematocrit of 43.6 and white blood count
of 9.8. LFTs were within normal range. PT of 20.2 , PTT of 38.2 ,
INR of 2.8. ABG on 100% face mask revealed 7.33 , 45 , 193 , 99.6% in
the Emergency Room. Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Room
revealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladder
stones , no evidence of triple A. Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly ,
low volume lungs without clear evidence of CHF. EKG upon arrival
in the Emergency Ward revealed sinus tachycardia , T wave flattening
in AVL , T wave inversion V4 through V6 which were new , poor R wave
progression which was old. Pain free EKG revealed resolution of T
wave inversion in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for the rule out MI
protocol. He actually ruled out for a myocardial
infarction with a CPK of 168 , CPK2 of 138 , and CPK3 of 147.
However on 0/9/96 his T wave inversion in V1 and V2 were noted to
be deeper on C set compared to A set. Subsequently that day the
patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. As his IV heparin
and TNG were being turned down he became acutely short of breath
with bilateral crackles half way up the lung fields. He was found
to be in flash pulmonary edema which was treated with heparin , IV
TNG , and also Lasix. The patient did very well after that and his
troponin level at that point was 0. The patient's CPKs were
recycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again.
His ABG at that point and during his acute episode of shortness of
breath was 7.37 , 43 , pO2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis he
was able to be on room air without any difficulty. It was
therefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on 7/21/96 which revealed
proximally occluded LAD , 60-70% lesion of OM1 , and 99% lesion of
proximal PDA , and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with
extensive anterior apical akinesis and also inferior apical
akinesis. Based on this it was decided that the patient had three
vessel disease. In anticipation of surgical conservation the
patient had a ETT MIBI on 11/27/96 and he was able to go on modified
Bruce protocol 6 minutes. He stopped secondary to fatigue. He did
not achieve target heart rate. His maximum heart rate was 104 and
85% of the predicted value. Subsequently the MIBI results revealed
anterior wall and septum and apex to be nonfunctional , however the
patient had known transmural myocardial infarction in inferior wall
which revealed viable myocardium there and also lateral wall
nonfunctioning wall. These are the preliminary results. It was
decided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior to
consideration for surgery. The patient's Isordil dose was
increased while in hospital and his Coumadin was restarted.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg
p.o. t.i.d , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.day , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. ,
nitroglycerin 1/150 p.r.n. chest pain. Coumadin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s ,
and Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient is being discharged in good
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Ayoub The patient is to be seen within one
week with Dr. Warmack of Gardmond Hospital for
Cardiology , and Dr. Bartolomeo of Thoracic Surgery per Dr. Ondrusek
recommendations. The patient has been chest pain free since
0/9/96 , since he had the episode of flash pulmonary edema. His
heparin was discontinued on 7/24/96. The patient remained chest
pain free with good oxygen saturation and was not short of breath.
