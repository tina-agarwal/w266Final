ATTENDING: VERDUGO , MAX ARTHUR MD
SERVICE: Medicine.
Mr. Lyn was admitted with hypoxia and hypotension initially in
the MICU. He is a 66-year-old male with coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , type 2 diabetes , hyperlipidemia , ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% , and history of CVAs. He was
recently admitted in March 2006 for a right middle lobe
pneumonia , spent 2 days in the hospital. He felt fine since then
with some waxing and waning. However , he presented with
increased cough , rigor's , difficulty walking and speaking , and a
fever to 101. He was found at home to be short of breath. He
had blue lips , hands per his family. EMS was called and found
that he had an O2 saturation of 80%; it increased to 97% on 100%
nonrebreather. EKG on admission showed new left bundle-branch
block , but cath lab declined to intervene because he was
tachycardic at that time. It was felt to be secondary to demand.
He was hypotensive in the ED requiring fluids. Subclavian line
was placed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD. He has 3-vessel coronary artery
disease , status post CABG x1 in 1999 , SVG to RCA. He had an
NSTEMI in 5/16 with Cypher stent to 70% proximal LAD and Pixel
stent to 70% ostial D1. He had an NSTEMI in March 2004 with a
new Cypher to D1 instent restenosis and diffuse left circ disease
was seen as well. He has hypertension , also type 2 diabetes , on
oral agents. He has hyperlipidemia. He has mitral valve status
post St. Jude 33-mm valve in 1999. He has ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35%. He has had multiple CVAs. He
is on treatment dose of Lovenox after failure of Coumadin and
prophylactic dose of Lovenox. He had a subdural hematoma in the
setting of Coumadin , status post bur-hole drainage in 1999. He
has seizure disorder history. He also has a history of carotid
stenosis , status post a left CEA in 2002. He has GERD and
history of sacral decubitus ulcer.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 325 daily , Toprol 200 daily ,
lisinopril 20 daily , Lovenox 80 b.i.d. , fenofibrate 145 daily ,
Lipitor 40 daily , glipizide 10 b.i.d. , Keppra 500 b.i.d. ,
Benadryl 25 b.i.d. as needed for itching , multivitamin , iron
sulfate 325 daily , trazodone 50 daily , Zantac 150 twice daily ,
and miconazole topical daily.
He has an allergy to Dilantin which causes a desquamating rash.
On admission to the MICU , his temperature was 96.7 , heart rate
75 , BP 98/54 , breathing at 14 , satting 97% on 4 L. He was in no
acute distress. Anicteric. OP was clear. Pulmonary exam
revealed crackles , decreased breath sounds at the bases , no
wheezes. He had a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart
sounds , mechanical S1. His JVP was from the jaw. He had
positive bowel sounds , obese , soft , nontender abdomen. His legs
were warm and dry with no rashes. He was awake but not
cooperative. He has a baseline left-sided facial droop , left
forearm flexion , moving all 4 extremities.
His admission chest x-ray showed a diffuse bilateral airspace
disease , right greater than left , no effusion , consistent with
multilobar pneumonia versus pulmonary edema. Echo in July 2005
showed an LVEF of 35% with a kinesis of septum , inferior wall ,
apical lateral segment and mechanical mitral valve. His EKG in
the MICU showed sinus at a rate of 76. When his rate was faster ,
he showed a left bundle-branch block.
COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. ID: There was a question of multilobar pneumonia based on
his recent admission for pneumonia and the appearance of his
chest x-ray. He was initially on empiric ceftriaxone ,
azithromycin , and vancomycin in the MICU. We discontinued the
vancomycin. Blood cultures were clear. He weaned from oxygen ,
and his chest x-ray cleared within 1 to 2 days. So , it was felt
that he had more of the component of CHF exacerbation. He
completed a short 7-day course of azithromycin.
2. Cardiovascular:
I. Ischemia: He has extensive CAD and showed an elevated CK ,
troponin , and a new left bundle branch in the setting of
hypotension. This was felt to be a demand ischemia. His enzymes were
elevated with his troponin remaining elevated at 5 , but the MB had
decreased from 18 to 2 rapidly. The cardiology consultants felt
that this was demand ischemia as the left bundle-branch block was
rate dependent and recommended continued medical management. He
is already on therapeutic-dose Lovenox for his history of CVA.
II. Pump: He initially had hypertension in the unit. This
resolved and he appeared euvolemic on his home dose of 20 mg of
Lasix daily. A repeat echo revealed no changes.
III. Rhythm: As mentioned above , he exhibited a new left
bundle-branch block in the setting of tachycardia but decreased
rate.
3. Heme: Initially had bleeding from his left subclavian site
in the setting of his anticoagulation; it resolved. Spoke with
the vascular wervice who recommended holding one dose of Lovenox when the
line was removed. This was done , and the line was removed
successfully without any bleeding.
4. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. His creatinine
remained at baseline of 1.2 to 1.5.
5. Neuro: He has a history of multiple CVAs. We kept him on
his treatment-dose Lovenox other than being held for 1 dose to
remove the line. He has seizure disorder. He is on Keppra. He
has a history of sundowning and was placed on Zyprexa briefly but
this was weaned.
6. Endo: At home , Mr. Vanzie was on oral medications. He was
started on Lantus and lispro and we decided to send him on Lantus
as well as some a.c. NovoLog as well.
Mr. Sindel was discharged home with services with followup
appointments with Dr. Willie Saale on 6/6/2006 at 1330 hours ,
Dr. Demaine on 9/18/2006 at 1550 hours , and with Dr.
Malmanger on 2/23/2006 at 1400 hours.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours as needed
for headache , aspirin 325 mg daily , Dulcolax 10 mg daily , Colace
100 mg twice daily , Lovenox 80 mg twice daily , fenofibrate 145 mg
daily , iron sulfate 325 mg daily , Lasix 20 mg daily , NovoLog 12
units subcutaneously with each meal , Lantus 44 mg each night ,
Atrovent nebs 0.5 mg 4 times daily , Keppra 500 mg twice daily ,
lisinopril 20 mg daily , Toprol-XL 200 mg daily , Zantac 150 mg
twice daily , multivitamin , and Lipitor 40 mg daily.
