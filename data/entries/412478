HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital on
9/2/04 and was taken to the OR the same day where he received
an aortic valve replacement using a 25 mm Carpentier Edwards
pericardial valve. He also received a 2-vessel CABG in which the
left internal mammary artery was grafted to the left anterior
descending artery and a saphenous vein was sewn to the first
obtuse marginal artery. Postoperatively , he was hemodynamically
stable and was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit. He was
quickly weaned off of the ventilator and was extubated. He was
then started on beta-blockade and on postoperative day 1 he was
transferred to the floor. Over the next few days , he was
diuresed. He later developed atrial fibrillation. He was
hemodynamically stable with this. However , his rate was in the
120s. Rate control was achieved using Diltiazem and Lopressor.
He was subsequently anticoagulated with Coumadin. On the day of
discharge , he remained alert and oriented , ambulating quite well
without assistance , hemodynamically stable with heart rate in the
70s. He was eating well and having a bowel movement and had been
diuresed quite well. He was felt to be fit for discharge and was
sent home in good condition. He will be seen by a visiting
nurse. Follow up will be initially with Dr. Maytubby who will
