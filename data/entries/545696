remained pain free throughout her hospital course and denied any
shortness of breath , increased lower extremity swelling , nausea ,
diaphoresis or other complaints. She had three sets of cardiac enzymes
return negative while in house. Her EKG showed evidence of old TWI with
some minimal flattening of T waves in II and V3. She had CXR showing no
acute cardiopulmonary process. She had adeno MIBI done on 6/11 showing no
evidence of EKG changes or symptoms with HR 51-&gt;71 and BP 124-&gt;70.
Final reading showed moderate ischemia in inferiolateral wall in L
circumflex territory with EF 59%. Her cardiologist Dr. Dossous was
called and recommended cath. She had a cardiac catheterization on 8/15 which
showed only distal disease and was not intervened upon. She will continue
with her medical management.

home. With her history of hypercoaguable disorders , she was started on
