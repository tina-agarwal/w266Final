HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 61 year old female with
coronary artery disease ( status post
PTCA , myocardial infarction , and coronary artery bypass graft ) who
presented with a few week history of near syncope and evidence of
inappropriate sinus arrest on Holter monitor for pacemaker
placement. Ms. Debrecht 's pertinent medical history was significant
for longstanding peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery
disease. In early 1992 , she first noted the onset of exertional
chest discomfort. Symptoms progressed and an exercise tolerance
test was performed in 9/11 which was standard Bruce protocol at
six minutes and thirty seconds with a maximal heart rate of 160 and
maximal blood pressure of 144 stopping secondary to 2 to 2.5 mm ST
depression inferolaterally. Cardiac catheterization in 5/24
revealed left anterior descending of 80 to 90% and mid right
coronary artery 99% ( with left-to-right and right-to-right
collaterals ). The right coronary artery lesion was PTCA to a 20%
residual which re-occluded and was re-PTCA to a 20% then
re-occluded again ( no PTCA a third time ). Echo in 5/24 revealed
an ejection fraction of 50% , inferior hypokinesis consistent with
prior myocardial infarction , and mild MVP/MR was also seen.
Coronary artery bypass graft times two vessels ( LIMA to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery ) was performed in 5/24 ( Dr. Nethery ). Since
then , she had done well with no further chest pain. Starting
approximately one month prior to admission , the patient began to
experience episodes of near syncope. Episodes consisted of the
sensation of light headedness , tunnel vision , tinnitus , and
diaphoresis ( although she felt near-syncopal , she had never
actually experienced true syncope ). During episodes , she
frequently felt the sensation of facial flushing with diaphoresis.
She could not recall precipitating events prior to the episodes but
did note that the events never occurred when she was active , only
when she was at rest ( but not asleep ). Holter monitor on July , 1996 revealed multiple three to four second pauses. The
patient's anti-hypertensive , metoprolol ( 25 mg b.i.d. ) was
discontinued , however , repeat Holter on 9/9/96 revealed multiple
pauses ( 114 pauses in a 24-hour period ) with the longest lasting
4.2 seconds. The patient was then sent to the Sa Ratee for further evaluation and management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As described in Secondary Diagnoses above.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Divorced , retired x-ray technician , former smoker
of one pack per day times thirty years quitting
eleven years ago , and history of ethanol consumption at the time of
divorce. Her primary medical doctor was Dr. Armand Shackelford
( Huban ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 76
and history of hypercholesterolemia , mother died
at age 86 of gastrointestinal ulceration and had a history of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and sister with non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal ulcers.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. ( discontinued three weeks ago ) ,
vitamin supplements ( vitamin E , lysine , Co-Q10 , vitamin C , calcium ,
Centrum Silver , and primrose oil ) , and no over-the-counter
medications.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin , Zantac , and Comtrex , all of which produce
angioedema and tetracycline ( sun sensitivity ).
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs showed a blood pressure of
160/110 , pulse 92 , temperature 97.0 ,
respirations 16 , and 97% on room air. GENERAL: Energetic white
female in no apparent distress. HEENT: Extraocular movements
intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynx
without erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly. NECK: Supple and carotids 2+ bilaterally without
bruits. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm at 72 with no
rubs , gallops , or murmurs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and
percussion. ABDOMEN: Obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tube
scars , and bowel surgery scar ( right just lateral of the midline ) ,
normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , no
hepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits. EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distal
pulses were 1+ bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity.
NEUROLOGICAL: Alert and oriented times three , cranial nerves
II-XII intact , strength 5/5 , sensory intact , deep tendon reflexes
3+ bilaterally throughout , and toes downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: SMA 7 was remarkable for a potassium of
3.9 , BUN 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liver
function tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled
7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233. PT was 12.3
( 1.1 ) and PTT equalled 30.4. Chest x-ray showed status post
coronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acute
air space disease and EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 with
an axis of 60 degrees , T wave inversion in V2 to V3 with upright in
V4 and V6 , and Q waves in II , III , and F.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 61 year old female with peripheral
vascular disease and coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted for
evaluation and management of near syncope. Holter monitor had
demonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation of
beta blocker ( metoprolol ). The patient was admitted for
observation over the weekend. She experienced multiple sinus
pauses , particularly at nighttime. The longest pause recorded was
4.7 seconds. Though she was aware of the irregular heart rhythm ,
she never became truly syncopal or had evidence of hemodynamic
instability. She was enrolled in the ECTH trial and underwent
placement of a dual chamber pacemaker randomized to the VVIR mode on
3/23/96. She tolerated the procedure without complication. Post-operative
chest x-ray revealed appropriate location of atrial and ventricular leads and
no evidence of pneumothorax. Interrogation of the pacemaker
revealed appropriate response. The patient did well overnight and
was discharged on March , 1996 with instructions to follow-up
with Dr. Passarella in ten days.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged on March , 1996 in good
condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: ASA 325 mg p.o. q.d. and Percocet one to
two tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
FOLLOW-UP: She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. Lafranca on
November , 1996 at 1 p.m.
