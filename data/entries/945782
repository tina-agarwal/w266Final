Arrange INR to be drawn on 11/8/07 with f/u INR's to be drawn every
7 days. INR's will be followed by VLGMHO coumadin clinic
ALLERGY: NKA
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS:
chest pain
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS ;Responsible After Study for Causing Admission )
musculoskeletal chest pain
OTHER DIAGNOSIS;Conditions , Infections , Complications , affecting Treatment/Stay
obesity , atrial fibrillation on coumadin , hypertension
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
none
OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )
Cardiac MIBI: preliminary results suggest this was a poor study , small
reversible inferior septal defect was thought to likely be artifact.
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

---------------------
hpi: 60F with afib on coumadin , hypertension. Woke up at 10 am with L
sided chest and back pain. Radiation to arm with motion. +nausea ,
+crampy abdominal pain. Worse with arm and body movement. Has 1 year
h/o progressive sob with exertion and increasing lower extremity
edema.

normal to mildly impaired. The estimated ejection fraction is 50%.

labs: K 3.3 , cr .9 studies:
portable cxr: clear ekg: brady at 48 with multiple atrial foci ,
varying pr intervals , different p wave morphology , q's in
III and avF ( change from prior ) , no st changes
stress test in 04: no ischemia , 4 minutes on bruce got her to 100% of
predicted hr
-----------------------
events: 1/5 w/ transient LBBB
----------------------------------
hospital course: 60F with htn , afib presents with acute onset L sided
chest/back/shoulder pain , atypical for cardiac cp.
1. ischemia: It was felt that patient's chest pain was likely
musculoskeletal. It was worse with movement of her arms and chest and ws
reproducible with palapation. She was ruled out for MI with serial
enzymes and ekgs. We continued her asa , lowered her dose of bblocker
given bradycardia , and started the patient on an ace inhibitor. She
underwent ETT and went into rate related L bundle branch block. Full
report as follows: 1. Peak METS = 5.7 2. Duke Treadmill Score = +4
( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ) 3. HR Recovery = 29
ASSESSMENT:1. Diagnosis: No evidence for ischemia at HR achieved.
Reduced sensitivity because ECG uninterpretable due to rate related LBBB.
2. Prognosis: Elevated prognostic risk based on low functional capacity
and a low Duke score of +4 ( Moderate risk: -10 to +4 ). 3.Arrhythmia:
Probable rate related LBBB at peak. 4. Hemodynamics: Normal exercise
hemodynamics.
Cardiology was consulted and they recommended a MIBI and echo to
better evaluate her cardiac function. She then underwent a MIBI which
showed a small inferior septaldefect , which was thought to likely be
artifact. Given the small area , it was felt medical management would be
the best approach. She was discharged on small dose of bblocker , ace
inhibitor asa and statin.
Pump: The patient's lasix had recently been increased to 60 mg bid. She
was not felt to be volume overloaded and was continued on this dose in
house. Her echo was done on the day of discharge and can be followed up
as an outpatient. Her blood pressures ran on the low side so she will
be discharged on a lower dose of her bblocker.
rhythm: Patient has underlying conduction system disease
with 1 degree av block and developed a left bundle branch block at a HR
of 150 during her ETT. She was continued on coumadin for h/o
afib
musculoskeletal pain: pain improved with standing tylenol and motrin
standing , with oxycodone for breakthrough
endocrine: Her fasting glucoses showed borderline glucose intolerance
with values around 110. These should be followed as an outpatient.
fen: low fat , low salt diet
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please follow up with you primary care provider. You did not have any
signs of significant heart disease. Please call your doctor if your
shortness of breath worsens , you develop new chest pressure , or you feel
lightheaded.
We have started a new medicine for your blood pressure and have lowered
the dose of your other blood pressure medicine.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
f/u final MIBI results
f/u final echo results
f/u electrolytes on ace-inhibitor
consider PFTs to better evaluate reason for progressive shortness of
breath on exertion ( does not appear to be cardiac in cause )
titrate bblocker and ace-inhibitor
follow fasting glucose values
No dictated summary
