ASSESSMENT: This is a 71-year-old woman with a history of
hypertension , CHF , status post a mitral valve/tricuspid valve
repair in mid July , complicated by postoperative C. diff
colitis and UTI who presented with persistent diarrhea and three
days of fever , chills and chest pain. The patient's fatigue was
most likely related to dehydration secondary to persistent C.
diff related diarrhea. Over the course of her hospitalization ,
it became clear that she experienced chest pain during her
intermittent episodes of ventricular ectopy. Now that her NSVT
is under better control , she is chest pain-free.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin , beta-blocker ,
statin and gemfibrozil. She had negative cardiac enzymes x3 and
ruled out by biomarkers.
Pump: The patient was initially dry on exam. She was rehydrated
with normal saline. The patient developed shortness of breath on
hospital day #4 , most likely secondary to overhydration. She was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Electrolytes were repleted twice
daily. She was then transitioned to 40 of Lasix p.o. daily and
finally per cardiology recommendation 20. She will be discharged
to home on 20 b.i.d. p.o.
Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. On
hospital day #2 , she developed atrial fibrillation with
hypotension most likely secondary to Diltiazem , which was
subsequently held. The patient's blood pressure improved
dramatically with gentle IV hydration on hospital day #2. Her
Diltiazem will be discontinued. The patient is on Coumadin now
with therapeutic INR on discharge at 2.6. Per cardiology , her
beta-blocker was increased to 75 q.i.d. and then she was
transitioned to Toprol 300 daily; however , she had persistent
nocturnal NSVT , which caused her some chest pain and was quite
frightening to her. Per cardiology , she was loaded on amiodarone
400 t.i.d. , which will be continued for 5 days post-discharge and
then the patient will be transitioned to 400 amiodarone daily.
At the same time , her Toprol will be decreased to 100 mg daily ,
her discharge dose. Echocardiogram was ordered on the day of
discharge per cardiology. See LMR for formal report.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient with recent UTI and C. diff
colitis in the setting of recent hospitalization antibiotic use
presented with diarrhea and elevated white count and fever.
Continued on Flagyl p.o. and vancomycin p.o. for Flagyl failure.
She had one C. diff positive stool. Stool became C. diff
negative as of 1/10/06. Her diarrhea rapidly slowed on dual
therapy. She will be discharged with seven more days of
antibiotics to complete.
3. Endocrine: The patient on home dose Synthroid. TSH
initially low , however , rechecked and found to be within normal
limits. Continue home dose of Synthroid.
4. Heme: The patient's hematocrit was stable throughout her
hospitalization. Continue Niferex at home dose , continue
Coumadin at 2.5 mg nightly.
5. Pulmonary: The patient had a low pretest probability for PE.
Given her allergy to IV contrast , she was not a candidate for
PECT; however , a V/Q scan was obtained on 0/12/06. The result
was low probability for pulmonary embolism. Her respiratory exam
improved greatly on b.i.d. Lasix.
6. Renal. The patient's creatinine was stable throughout her
hospitalization.
7. Prophylaxis: Coumadin with therapeutic INR plus proton pump
inhibitor.
8. FEN: The patient was initially started on a clear liquid
diet. On hospital day #3 , she began to eat solid foods and
tolerated well.
9. Code status: The patient was a full code throughout her
hospitalization.
