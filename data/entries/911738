HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old woman
with a history of breast cancer and
cardiomyopathy , secondary to Adriamycin , as well as other medical
problems , with left hip pain that has been a chronic issue and
which prompted her to present to Onver Hospital
Emergency Department on March , 2000. In the Emergency
Department , the patient became progressively lethargic and an
arterial blood gas there revealed hypoventilation , presumed
secondary to obesity and the patient's congestive heart failure.
Blood sugar in the Emergency Department was found to be 46 and the
patient was given D50 , but eventually required a D10 drip to
maintain her sugars. The patient was also placed on BIPAP to
maintain O2 saturations. It seemed that the combination of
congestive heart failure and poor baseline respiration , secondary
to body habitus , led to this acute worsening. The patient was
stabilized in the Emergency Department and sent to the floor on
BIPAP.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history included
Adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy ,
hypertension , diabetes , sarcoid left breast cancer ,
hypercholesterolemia , deep venous thromboses , OSA , and coronary
artery disease , status post myocardial infarctions x 2.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of admission , the patient
was on Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
Dulcolax 5-10 mg p.o. q. day p.r.n. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day ,
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Robitussin DM
10 ml q. 4 hours p.r.n. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. q.i.d. , insulin NPH
30 mg subcutaneously b.i.d. , Zestril 40 mg p.o. q. day , Maalox ,
Milk and Magnesia , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual p.r.n. , Senna
tablets p.r.n. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day , Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,
oxycontin 10 mg p.o. q. 12 hours , oxycodone 5-10 mg q. 6 hours
p.r.n. pain , and Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's social history revealed that she
lives alone with family help for daily chores.
The patient denied a history of tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination revealed the patient to
be an obese woman with vital signs revealing
temperature 96 , pulse 93 , blood pressure 115/60 , respiratory rate
24 , and saturations 78% on 1.5 liters of oxygen , with 97% on 4
liters of oxygen. HEENT examination showed no jugular venous
distention. The neck was thick. There was no lymphadenopathy and
no carotid bruits. Extraocular movements were intact. The pupils
were equal , round and reactive to light. Cardiovascular
examination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur , rub ,
or gallop. The lungs showed good breath sounds bilaterally , and
few crackles in both bases anteriorly. The abdomen was
non-distended and non-tender , obese , firm , and with hypoactive
bowel sounds. The extremities showed generalized anasarca.
Neurological examination showed the patient to be alert and
responsive at the time of examination. Cranial nerves II-XII were
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on admission revealed sodium 140 ,
potassium 5.7 , chloride 99 , bicarb 34 , BUN 32 ,
creatinine 1.3 , glucose 40 , white count 8.2 , hematocrit 39.3 ,
platelets 241 , ALT 32 , AST 65 , LDH 717 , CK 436 , with an MB fraction
of 5.4 , troponin I 0.22 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.1 ,
alkaline phosphatase 381 , digoxin 1.8 , calcium 9.4 , and albumin
4.1. Urine tox screen was negative. An INR was 2.5 , PTT 32.0 , and
D-dimer greater than 1000. Arterial blood gas before BIPAP showed
pH 7.41 , pCO2 63 , and pO2 66 on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula. A portable chest x-ray showed moderate to severe
pulmonary edema , bilateral hilar fullness , right greater than left ,
and cardiomegaly. Abdominal ultrasound was negative for ascites.
A KUB showed free air , non-specific bowel gas pattern , and no
obstruction. A urinalysis showed no protein , 2+ blood , 5-10 red
blood cells , and 1+ squamous epithelial cells. Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm in the 80s , low voltage , with no change
from previous studies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit
for diuresis and continued BIPAP. However , the
patient did not tolerate BIPAP , but diuresed well , in fact , too
well , to intravenous boluses of Lasix , with urine output of 7
liters negative in one day , on March , followed by ventilatory
failure on March , with bicarb greater than assay. The patient
was transferred to the CCU for worsening respiratory acidosis and
not tolerating BIPAP. The patient was intubated at that time. The
patient began spiking temperatures on March , as well , and was
started on a regimen of levofloxacin and clindamycin on July
for the question of aspiration pneumonia. On March , a
Swan-Ganz catheter was floated with pulmonary capillary wedge
pressures of 25 and the patient was started on afterload reduction
with Isordil , hydralazine , and Diamox for metabolic alkalosis ,
which was thought to be contributing to her worsening respiratory
acidosis. On August , ceftazidime was started for Pseudomonas ,
which was found in the patient's sputum. Over the next several
days , the patient had an increased peak requirement to oxygenate
satisfactorily. On June , vancomycin was started for coag
negative Staph , which was cultured from an arterial line , and
levofloxacin was discontinued. On March , the antibiotics were
changed per recommendation of the Infectious Disease consultation
to ceftazidime and Flagyl for Pseudomonas in the sputum culture ,
and the question of C. diff. Vancomycin and clindamycin were
discontinued at that time. On February , amikacin was added for
double coverage for advanced associated pneumonia with Pseudomonas.
Subsequently , the patient slowly improved and it became easier to
oxygenate her , with a decreasing fever curve. A chest CT scan on
March , was consistent with bilateral pneumonia , as well. On
March , the patient was taken off the vent to a trach collar ,
following her tracheostomy and PEG procedure , which she tolerated
well on March . 
Other issues in the patient's hospitalization have included
hypernatremia , thought secondary to the patient's receiving large
amounts of Lasix and having no access to free water. This was
treated with free water boluses. The patient also had prerenal
azotemia , which was improving at the time of discharge , as well as
coronary artery disease , which was not an issue , and fluid
overload , secondary to cardiomyopathy , which was much improved.
The patient's course was also complicated by acute renal failure ,
with creatinines rising as high as 2.6 before falling to 1.5 on the
day prior to discharge. The patient's chest CT scan also showed
significant lymphadenopathy , which was noted prior , and was thought
to be secondary to sarcoid , which was recurrent CA , at this point ,
given that there was no biopsy data. Also , a transthoracic
echocardiogram showed a thickened mitral valve , which may be
unchanged from prior studies , and the clinical suspicion for
endocarditis was fairly low. However , if further positive blood
cultures should arise , this might require further work-up. The
patient's course was also complicated by anemia , which has required
several blood transfusions while the has been here. The patient
has had several episodes of bleeding and oozing from various
procedure sites , as well as some guaiac positive stool. The
patient's reticulocyte was found to be 4.9% , while the hematocrit
at that point , on February , was 25.7%. Given her reticulocyte
index of 1.40 , which was inappropriately low , the patient was ,
therefore , started on erythropoietin , as well as iron
supplementation. The patient was also supplemented with tube
feeds , as well as Promod protein supplements , during the course of
her admission. In terms of the patient's endocrine issues , the
patient was treated with insulin , including varying doses of
regular insulin , NPH , and subcutaneously , as well as insulin drips
at times. While in the hospital , Physical Therapy began to see the
patient prior to discharge and the patient was able to transfer
from bed to chair with assistance.
While in the hospital , the patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG
procedure on March , 2000.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient was
in stable condition.
DISPOSITION: The patient was to be transferred to the Pulmonary
Rehabilitation program at the U Of . 
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up care should include monitoring the patient's
anticoagulation with checking heparin factor 10A levels
for her Lovenox after the third dose on March .  The patient
may also be transitioned to Coumadin once a satisfactory
anticoagulation with Lovenox has been achieved. The patient should
also follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Ronnie G Sheldon at Park as soon as possible while at Park Cean Hamppo or
after she is discharged from there.
