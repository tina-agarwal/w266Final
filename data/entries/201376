Hospital course by problem:
1 ) CP: Pt with story unlikely to be cardiac origin but has RF for
ischemia in HTN. No sig fhx. Rule out by enzymes. CT chest in ED neg
for PE or dissection. Was kept on BBlock after admission , bu
t c/o feeling heavy and noted significant Bradycardia overnight to
48-52. BBlock was then DC'd and BP was controlled with hctz. On HD#2
Pt w/ episode CP and weakness. No EKG changes on R or L EKG. Pain did
not resolve after 3 nitro. Pt received MSO4 1mg and Maalox with
complete resolution of pain and weakness; no further sx for the rest
of the day. Given likely poor exercise tolerance ETT was changed to
Dobutamine-MIBI 0/7 .  MIBI was read as negative. DC'd to home with
ECASa , lisinopril , verapamil , hctz.
2 ) HTN: Pt on Verapimil and Lisinopril at home. Had tried Maxzide in
past but did not tolerate. Given "weakness" sx , B blocker dc'd.
Started HCTZ for long term management of HTN. Verapamil 480 mg also
split into BID dosing. KDur rx'd for hypokalemia.
DC'd to home with f/u by PMD in 1-2 weeks , bp check and k check.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your dobutamine stress test was negative for coronary disease. Take
your blood pressure medications as prescribed. Please take the
verapamil 240 mg twice a day. Continue to take the hctz in the
morning. HCT will lower potassium low , so we have started a low dose of
potassium in pill form every day. Please make an appointment to see
Dr. Kosky within 1-2 weeks for a check of your blood pressure and your
potassium. You may try maalox for your chest pain , but if it worsens or
you have significant shortness of breath , come to hospital or call MD
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1 ) BP follow-up
2 ) Check potassium , on hctz
