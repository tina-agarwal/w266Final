ATTENDING: KRAWIECZ , GRANVILLE BILL MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and
angioplasty in 1991. However , he had no history of myocardial
infarction or congestive heart failure. The patient's history
also is notable for severe depression and anxiety. He had been
fine with medical management of his coronary artery disease until
three to four months prior to admission when he began feeling
tightness in the chest and midsternal chest pain on admission. A
stress test performed in March showed abnormalities in the septal
and apical segments and an ejection fraction of 60%. During the
last several months , the patient experienced increasing frequency
of his anginal episodes and on 4/23/05 he was admitted to
Rissa H/bar Medical Center because of complaints of chest pain
and high blood pressure up to 230/130. The patient did
experience relief with sublingual nitroglycerin. His EKG showed
changes positive for ischemia and a troponin leak of 0.15. He
was scheduled for cardiac catheterization performed on 11/0/05 ,
which revealed left main coronary artery stenosis , LAD stenosis ,
and a long RCA stenosis. The patient was then referred for
surgical revascularization of his coronary arteries.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus treated
with diet , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , asthma , ruptured disk x2
at age 20 , GERD , depression with three recent hospitalizations.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right breast biopsy 14 years ago revealed
to be benign.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Denies tobacco use.
ALLERGIES: To beestings. Penicillin causes a rash and Demerol
causes dizziness.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg daily , lisinopril 30 mg
daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , Nexium 40 mg daily , Cymbalta 80 mg
daily , Seroquel 100 mg daily.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Height 5 feet 8 inches , weight 7.05 kg. Vital
signs , temperature 96 degrees , heart rate 77 , O2 saturation 98%.
HEENT , PERRLA , dentition without evidence of infection , no
carotid bruits. Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , no
murmurs. Respiratory , breath sounds clear bilaterally. Abdomen ,
no incisions. Extremities , without scarring , varicosities or
edema. Neuro , alert and oriented , no focal deficits. Pulses 2+
bilaterally throughout. Allen's test of the right and left upper
extremity revealed normal.
PREOPERATIVE LAB: Sodium 133 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 100 ,
bicarb 26 , BUN 20 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 230. White blood cell
count 5 , hemoglobin 12.5 , hematocrit 38.1 , platelets 165. PT
14.1 , INR 1 , PTT 37.7. Urinalysis was normal.
Cardiac catheterization performed on 11/0/05 at Opa Mapalmmoss Medical Center 90% proximal left main , 100% proximal LAD , 85%
ostial OM-1 , 75% RCA with right dominant circulation. EKG on
2/17/05 showed normal sinus rhythm at 79 with a left bundle
branch block. Chest x-ray on 2/17/05 was normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac catheterization was performed on
11/0/05 which revealed critical coronary artery disease and the
patient was referred for immediate surgery. The following
morning , the patient was brought to the operating room where Dr.
Cappleman performed a CABG x5 using a LIMA to the LAD and sequential
graft connecting the aorta to the acute marginal and then the PDA
using saphenous vein graft. A second saphenous vein graft
connected the aorta to the OMA-1 and then the OM-2. The aortic
cross-clamp time was 68 minutes and the total cardiopulmonary
bypass time was 119 minutes. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred postoperatively to the Intensive Care
Unit in hemodynamically stable condition. On postoperatively day
1 , the patient was extubated , he was found to be anxious and the
psychiatric medications were restarted. By postoperative day 2 ,
the patient complained of pain , which was highly related to
anxiety. The patient had borderline hypotension , which responded
well to fluid. By the third day after surgery , the patient had
remained hemodynamically stable and was ready for transfer to the
Step-Down Unit for the remainder of his recovery. The patient's
chest tubes and pacer wires were removed and a follow-up chest
x-ray showed no pleural effusion , pneumothoraces , and only
minimal pulmonary congestion , which responded well to diuretics.
The patient's postoperative EKGs showed a bundle-branch block
that had existed preoperatively and his cardiologist advised that
the patient could continue a beta-blocker as tolerated. During
the last several days of his hospital stay , the patient required
a lot of reassurance regarding his excellent recovery. He was
ambulating comfortably in the hallways and had remained in the
sinus rhythm with rate in the 70s and stable blood pressure. A
repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of any pulmonary congestion.
By postoperative day 7 , the patient was ready for discharge home
with his wife who is a nurse.
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: On the day of discharge , the patient's
vital signs were as follows: Temperature 97.3 degrees , heart
rate 84 and sinus rhythm , blood pressure 126/70 , respiratory rate
20 , and the patient was oxygenating well on room air.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , chloride
103 , bicarb 27 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1 , glucose 107 , calcium 8.6 ,
magnesium 1.7 , white blood cell count 7 , hemoglobin 9.9 ,
hematocrit 29.8 , platelets 244.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISPOSITION: Discharged home with VNA services.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg daily ,
diltiazem 30 mg three times a day , Colace 100 mg three times a
day , ibuprofen 400 mg q.8h. p.r.n. pain , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.6h.
