chest pain were P57-92 , BP 104/70 , O2 98%RA. Pt then brought to the RMH
ED , where she no longer c/o sx but was found to be tachy in afib w/

for cataracts b/l , CN intact , lungs CTA b/l , CVS tachy , ?S4 , abd s/nt ,
ext www , no edema. Pt. unable to cooperate for full neurological exam.
Labs notable for K of 5.4 , Ca of 8.1 , and WCT of 15.02. EKG:tachy at
111 , reg rhythm ?sinus vs. atrial flutter. .5mm ST depression in V5 , no
TW changes , QW in 3 , aVF ( unchanged ). CXR: No evidence of pulm edema/
infiltrate. Pt given 50 mg PO lopressor and 5mg IV lopressor X 4 w/
persistent tachycardia to the low 100s.
ASSESSMENT: 69 y/o female with h/o CHF , DM , tachyarrhythmias , and CVAs
presents w/ chest pain , facial twitching. Pt admitted for stabilization
of HR and r/o MI.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) CARDS:
Ischemia: Pt ruled out by enzymes/EKG X3. Did not complain of CP/ SOB
during admission. On ASA , Beta blocker
Pump: H/o CHF w/ EF 50-55% in 3/13/04. No evidence of volume overload
by PE , CXR. On lasix 20 mg po qd. Repeat ECHO 8/21/04 showed a mild
interval reduction in LV EF down to 35-40% without significant
valvular abnormalities.
Rhythm: Pt tachy to 110s on admission but hemodynamically stable. O/N
HD1 had episode of afib at 130s-140s , desat to 88%. No complaints of
CP. Given diltiazem 10 mg IV w/ return of HR to low 100s ( baseline ).
Started diltiazem 30 mg po QID w/ drop in HR to 70s-80s , w/ irregular
rhythm. Per EKG , ?sinus arrhythmia vs ?atrial fibrillation w/ normal
rate. TSH pending. On HD4 , pt. had episode of bradycardia down to 50s
( approximately 1 hour ) asymptomatic with no evidence of heart block.
Toprol XL was restarted at home dose ( 100 mg qd ) , and diltiazem was
kept at qid dosing upon discharge. Given the brief episode of
bradycardia and concerns for both bradycardia and heart block , it was
decided to place a continuous loop monitor on the patient. She will
follow up in outpatient cardiology on June and with her PCP on
June
2 ) NEURO: Has hx of CVA. Head CT on 1/14/04 shows old infarct , no new
lesion. Per proxy , pt. back to baseline mental status upon admission.
No episodes of facial twitching during admission. On aricept.

Given hx. of cough , a sputum gs/cx were done and were negative. WCT
down to 8.03 by discharge. Pt. on prednisone for temporal arteritis;
this may have been the cause of the WCT elevation , but this is
unlikely as WCT dropped by discharge.
4 ) ENDO: On metformin 850 mg BID for DM. In addition , had pt. on
sliding scale insuling during admission.
5 ) FEN: Potassium initially elevated , but down to 3.8 by discharge; No
EKG changes were observed. Ca was low , and was repleted - it may have
been responsible for facial twitches. On ADA diet.

rechecked on day of discharge per Dr. Newberg To be followed up
as outpatient.

proxy at her next appt.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please continue to take your home medications. We have added a new
