Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: LINAHAN , OMER M.D.
PRINCIPLE ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Bacteremia , peri-sepsis and
apnea.
PRINCIPLE DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Bacteremia , peri-sepsis and
apnea , as well as failure to tolerate p.o. diets.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He is an 81-year-old man primarily
Russian-speaking , with a history of multiple medical problems
including coronary artery disease status post an MI in 2004 as
well as a cath at the same time with percutaneous intervention ,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45-50% ,
atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation and a partial pacemaker
for sick sinus syndrome , multiple strokes x4 , diabetes mellitus
type 2 and COPD , who was recently admitted to the Ghampemaw A Hospital for
bacteremia with Streptococcus oralis without a clear source. His
white blood cell count had increased to 20. His INR had been
supratherapeutic on admission at that time to 14. At that time ,
he had had a transesophageal echocardiogram which did not show
any vegetations and he was discharged to rehab on 3/14/06 with a
course of IV penicillin through a PICC line , as well as oral
Flagyl empirically for an elevated white count. At the rehab
facility where he was placed , the patient was found to have
pulled his PICC line and the patient was complaining of being
short of breath and having some mental status changes. He was
treated with some sublingual nitroglycerin at the outside
facility and brought to the Ellwis Medical Center Emergency Room , where a chest
x-ray showed some lack of the PICC line and the short of breath
quickly improved in the emergency room. He was , however ,
lethargic and then at times , apneic in the emergency room. A gas
was performed which showed respiratory alkalosis with a pH of
7.5 , a pCO2 of 34 and a pAO2 of 135. The patient then became
slightly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures to the 90s ,
was given IV fluid boluses as well as treated empirically with
vancomycin and ceftazidime , to which his blood pressure responded
by going up to around 100-110/60. Given his apnea , a CPAP was
initiated in the emergency department and his oxygenation issues
quickly resolved. A head CT was performed , which was negative.
A right internal jugular line was placed and gentle rehydration
therapy according to early goal-directed therapy for peri-sepsis
was initiated , given the presumption of repeat bacteremia and
early sepsis. He was admitted to medicine for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
2004 and a cath in 2005. He is status post a hip fracture in
2005. He has peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , COPD but not
reported to be on any home oxygenation , dementia , Paget disease ,
atrial fibrillation , BPH , congestive heart failure , EF of 45-50% ,
hypertension , diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included the following: Glucotrol 10 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day , metformin 500 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. x10 days which was started
on 2/5/06 , sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n. , nystatin suspension
q.i.d. , Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.o. q. h.s. , Penicillin G 3 million units
IV q. 4h x7 days , Milk of Magnesia , Tylenol p.r.n. , Dulcolax
p.r.n. , Colace p.r.n. , atenolol 50 mg q. day , Lipitor 20 mg q.
day , Senna liquid q. h.s. , Flomax 0.4 q. day.
ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a history of heavy tobacco use. He quit
40 years ago. He lives at home with a 24-hour attendant and he
rarely uses alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM notable for the following: His
temperature was 95.9 , his heart rate was 60 , his blood pressure
was 110/62. He is satting 98% on a CPAP machine. In general , he
was in no acute distress in restraints. His head and neck exam
was notable for a supple neck. Pupils are equal , round and
reactive. His heart demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm. His
JVP was flat. He did not demonstrate any murmurs , rubs , or
gallops. His pulmonary exam was clear anteriorly. His abdominal
exam was noted for being soft , nontender , and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds and mild tympani. He had good peripheral
pulses with trace lower extremity edema. His neuro exam was
nonfocal.
OPERATIONS: During his hospital stay at this time included a PEG
tube placement which happened on 4/2/06.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. ID: The patient has a history of recent strep oralis
bacteremia and leukocytosis. He was afebrile at the time of
admission; however , given concern for possible early sepsis given
his blood pressure , he was treated with empiric IV fluids and
antibiotics with vancomycin and ceftazidime. His chest x-ray
looked like it might have some aspiration and he was treated with
an empiric 7-day course of Ceptaz and Flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia. This course was completed earlier in his hospital
stay. He was also initially treated with vancomycin. A PICC was
placed on 11/0/06 for further antibiotic management of his
bacteremia. His vancomycin was switched to IV penicillin and
this will be continued for a full 3-4 week course on 8/14/07. A
TEE was considered unnecessary given the fact that he was going
to be treated anyway with antibiotics for 4 weeks. All blood ,
urine , sputum cultures and stool cultures remained no growth to
date at the time of discharge.
2. Pulmonary: As mentioned above , the patient demonstrated some
apnea in the Emergency Department which resolved with CPAP;
however , given the fact that the patient was a significant
aspiration risk , a CPAP was considered unnecessary and possibly
would increase the risk of aspiration. Pulmonary was consulted ,
who felt that the patient was demonstrating Cheyne-Stokes
respirations secondary to possible CHF or history of CVAs that he
has had in the past. His ABG , as I mentioned above , demonstrated
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His repeat ABG showed no significant change , which likely
indicates a chronic process. He did not demonstrate any PEs on
studies that were performed here. No pneumonia was noted and the
desaturations that were detected while the patient was sleeping
overnight on 15 units O2 sat monitor resolved quickly with 2
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A plan was made to not
reinitiate CPAP given the aspiration risk. He was initially
diuresed mildly with Lasix. This was eventually discontinued.
The patient should receive nighttime supplemental oxygen ,
particularly if he desaturates to less than 90%.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient is status post an MI , status
post PCI in 2004. His enzymes were negative on this admission
and a repeat EKG was unchanged from previous. The patient was
restarted on his home doses of aspirin , statin , beta blocker 2
pump. The patient's ejection fraction was 45-50% with inferior
wall hypokinesis. Hypotension improved on admission , restarted
his beta blocker and his ACE inhibitor and IV fluids at the time
of discharge. Re the patient's history of a-fib , he was in
normal sinus rhythm for the majority of his hospital stay.
Coumadin was held peri-procedure when he was getting his PEG
placed and vitamin K had been administered in view of his
supratherapeutic Coumadin. His Coumadin should be restarted on
0/30/07. Of note as well for rhythm issues , the patient was
kept on potassium and magnesium scales while in hospital and he
has a partial pacemaker placed for his sick sinus syndrome.
4. GI: The patient had a history of constipation. His abdomen
was tympanitic when he first presented. He was given a bowel
regimen and has subsequently begun making good solid stool.
Midway through his hospital course , the patient developed trouble
with eating. He had multiple NG tubes placed which he was
self-discontinuing requiring urgent reconsideration of more
permanent feeding tubes. A discussion was held between our
service and the GI team , who felt that a PEG would be useful for
managing this patient's feeding in the future. On 2/25/06 , GI
endoscopically placed a PEG tube for future feeding. Nutrition
was consulted and tube feeds were re-initiated that evening.
Again , his Coumadin will be held until 9/23/07 so as to promote
appropriate wound healing around the site of the PEG placement.
5. Heme: The patient had a history of anemia but did not
demonstrate any acute hematocrit drops. His INR on admission was
1.9. We had transiently restarted Coumadin but he will have to
restart that again on 9/23/07 , given the fact that it was held
for his PEG placement. He was continued on iron supplements
during his hospital stay.
6. Renal: The patient , as discussed above , has demonstrated a
respiratory alkalosis with a mild metabolic alkalosis as well.
His creatinine was mildly elevated which is secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency for unclear reasons. His creatinine by the
time of discharge had improved dramatically to 0.7.
7. Endocrine: The patient's oral hypoglycemics were held during
this hospital stay. He was started on insulin sliding-scale and
Lantus. As his feeding has increased and his tube feeds have
reached goal , his Lantus has had to be titrated up. He is
currently at 15 units q. p.m. He may need more while at the
facility that he is going to.
8. GU: The patient has a history of vesiculous spermatocele or
hydrocele , which is going to be followed by urology as an
outpatient. We had held his Flomax initially given low blood
pressure but we restarted it during his hospital stay here.
9. FEN: As mentioned above , the patient is on aspiration
precautions secondary to speech and swallow evaluation that was
consistent with aspiration. NG tubes were placed multiple times
but were self-discontinued by the patient. Finally , a PEG tube
was placed on 1/5 and tube feeds were reinitiated that evening.
10: Psych: The patient has a history of being mildly agitated.
Zyprexa was initiated here at home doses of 2.5 mg q. day and
then titrated up to 2.5 mg b.i.d. The patient has responded very
nicely to this and is no longer agitated.
11. Prophylaxis: He was kept on TEDS and P-boots. Coumadin as
mentioned above will need to be restarted on 9/23/07 and Nexium
was to continue while he is here.
The patient is full code. His contacts include his son ( 053 ) 471-4960 and Hillesheim , his daughter ( 226 ) 407-4962.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: See addendum
DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a temperature of 98.4 T
max , his current is 96.6. His heart rate is in the 90s. His
blood pressure has been stable in the 110-120s/70-80s. His
respirations have been 18-20 , satting 92-96% on room air. In
general , he is in no acute distress. His lungs are with coarse
bilateral breath sounds. His rate and rhythm were regular
without murmurs. His abdomen is soft and nontender with good
bowel sounds. His extremities are without edema.
He is to be discharged today , 1/26/06 , to rehabilitation where
they will focus primarily on his physical therapy and rehab
needs.
