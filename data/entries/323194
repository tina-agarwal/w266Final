BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Aortic valve area evaluation HPI
admitted for aortic valve evaluation via catherization. This patient was
scheduled to have cystoscopy and bladder intervention for a possible
bladder cancer as well as TURP at Whee Hospital on 3/5/2006. His
surgeon wanted a pre-surgical cardiac evaluation given this history of
AS. The patient has had not changes in his functional activity recently.
Of note , his past history is notable for 2/15 with a right hemispheric
ischemic stroke. He has been having a gradual recovery: there is no
sensitivity in the left leg , though the motor deficits have improved and
he is able to walk with a walker. When he really exerts himself , he had
episodes of SOB but no chest pain , palpitations , presyncope or syncope.
He does have an unclear history of orthopnea but it might not be of a
cardiac etiology. Of note his activity has not been limited by any
cardiac complaints.
PMH:1. Chronic atrial fibrillation with slow VR2. Calcified aortic valve
with AS , calculated AVE 0.6 cm2 , 10/21 Moderately reduced LV
systolic function. Estimated LVEF 35-40% 6/28 Complete LBBBc. S/P

Labs/Studies: Cath 80% LAD lesion , pRCA 90%. PCW21 ,
PA 53/14 , AV gradient 30 , valve area 0.94 low EF 35% CO 4.46
Previous EKG: Atrial fibrillation with complete RBBB and likely pulse
inferior in septal MI.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM 6/26 Aortic valve is calcified with reduced opening
excursion and increased flow velocity to 4 m/s. Estimated peak gradient
64 mmHg , mean 37 mmHg. AVA not calculated. Normal MV with mitral annular
calcification and mild MR by color flow. Normal TV with low velocity TI
at 2 m/s suggestive of normal PASP. Mild LAE and RAE. RV is not well
visualized. LV is not well visualized with normal wall thickness and
normal cavity size and grossly moderate LV systolic dysfunction globally
with estimated LVEF 35-40% , qualified by the quality of the images.
Cath: 80% LAD lesion , 90%pRCA , ++MR , pseunormalisation of AV gradient at
30 and valve area of 0.9
( see L cath data for details )
Assessment: 81 year old male here for evaluation of AV for possible AVR
with revascularization.
Plan:
1. Aortic Stenosis: Stable post cath , groin site stable.
- We provided regular post cath care
- We continued patients home medications
- Seen by cardiac surgery who want w/u prior to surgery ( see
instructions )
- Asked patient to follow up with Scut Hospital Medical Center Cardiology
2. Hypertension:
- We continued patient on home medications
- No issues
3. DM:RISS and Lantus
- Good control.
4. Ppx:
- Nexium , no anticoagulation given bleeding risk.
