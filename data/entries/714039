Discharge Date: 3/25/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SEVERE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST
PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY
ANGIOPLASTY/STENT PLACEMENT TIMES TWO , LEFT
CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Lechman is a 50-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery
disease significant for an 80% mid circumflex , 95% mid right , 70%
distal right , 50% distal left anterior descending coronary artery
lesions with posterobasilar hypokinesis in the setting of a
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction , hypertension times
greater than 30 years , and an elevated cholesterol who was in his
normal state of health until the morning of admission. At that
time , he was performing strenuous work in his bakery and began to
suffer from 4/10 chest pain , "heaviness" , and discomfort. The pain
did not radiate. He denies dizziness , shortness of breath ,
palpitations , and diaphoresis. The patient took one sublingual
nitroglycerin and sat down with resolution of pain in approximately
five minutes. The patient then returned to work. Several hours
later , while again performing strenuous work , the patient suffered
a similar episode of chest pain and heaviness which he rates as a
2/10. The patient sat down and , this time , the pain resolved
without sublingual nitroglycerin in approximately three minutes.
The patient was disconcerted by these multiple events and went to
the Skaggsmiddrish Hospital Emergency Room for further work up. While
sitting comfortably in the Emergency Room at Nantsi Memorial Hospital , the
patient suffered a similar event of chest pain and tightness , which
he reports to be approximately 1.5/10. He took one sublingual
nitroglycerin with resolution of his symptoms in approximately five
minutes. The patient was transferred to Slandchor Hospital Medical Center at that point. One hour later , in Sa Hospital Emergency Room , the patient suffered a similar episode of
chest pain and tightness , this time rated at 1/10 , with resolution
of pain in approximately one minute , not requiring sublingual
nitroglycerin. The patient reported , at that time , that his life
had been very stressful , and that he had been working very hard in
his bakery. Review of symptoms is consistent with above and ,
otherwise , noncontributory.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease diagnosed in 1994
with catheterization performed in May
1994. There was 80% mid circumflex , 70% distal , 95% mid right , 50%
distal left anterior descending occlusions. Posterobasilar
hypokinesia with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. 2.
Hypertension times greater than 30 years. 3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Hepatitis in 1991 , believed to be of a viral type with complete
resolution of symptoms and no sequela. 5. An exercise tolerance
test in February 1996 that showed 2 mm ST segment depression in the
inferior and lateral leads. The exercise tolerance test proceeded
without chest pain.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy in the distant past.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. 2.
Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 3. Atenolol
100 mg p.o. q.day. 4. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. 5. Enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg q.day.
ALLERGIES: Shellfish causes a rash.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had hypertension , grandmother with coronary
artery disease. There is no history of diabetes
mellitus or cancer.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies current tobacco use. He
reports a 40 pack year history , quitting five
years ago. The patient denies alcohol use. The patient lives at
home with wife. They have no children. The patient reports that
he is now on a low cholesterol diet , has lost 100 lb over the last
two years , and was successfully walking four to five miles a day
without chest pain or other symptoms until the day prior to
admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile. His blood
pressure was 132/84 , heart rate 62 , and a
room air saturation of 96%. Generally , Mr. Mcalister was an
alert , well appearing man in no apparent distress. He was eager to
answer our questions. Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat
examination was significant only for exanthema under the right eye.
The patient's neck was supple with full range of motion and no
lymphadenopathy. There were bilateral carotid bruits. Carotid
pulses were 2+. The patient had jugular venous distention of 6 cm
with the head of the bed elevated at 15 degrees. Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally. Heart examination was significant for
normal S1 and S2 , and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur that was
heard best at the lower left sternal border , although it was
audible at the right sternal border , left mid axillary line , and
appeared to radiate to the carotids. The abdominal examination was
benign. The patient's extremities were clear of cyanosis ,
clubbing , or edema. The patient had 2+ symmetrical pulses
throughout. The patient was guaiac negative by report was normal
tone. Neurologic examination was nonfocal and significant for the
patient being alert and oriented times three , with a motor
examination showing 5/5 strength throughout. Sensory examination
was intact to light touch. Cranial nerves II-XII were intact. The
patient had deep tendon reflexes that were 2+ throughout.
LABORATORY DATA: The patient was found to have normal
electrolytes. White count was 6.3 and hematocrit
41.2. CPK obtained at Storgwi Hospital was 148 and serial
CPKs obtained at Scc Side Medical Center were 81 , 114 ,
115 , respectively. No MB fraction was done. At Ins Medical Center , the patient had an EKG taken that was significant for
normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute with intervals of
169/93/402 with no Q waves , no ST changes. This was consistent
with an EKG from July , 1996. An EKG obtained at Han Rutl Medical Center showed normal sinus rhythm at 64 beats per minute
with intervals of 172/100/412 with one PVC captured. However ,
there were no Q waves and no ST changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was begun on heparin 1 , 000 units per
hour IV after an initial 5 , 000 units IV bolus.
The patient consistently maintained a PTT in the range of 60-80
seconds. The patient underwent a catheterization the day following
admission which demonstrated 80% occlusion of the ramus branch ,
100% occlusion of the left obtuse marginal branch number one , and a
100% occlusion of the patient's right coronary artery. It was
decided that the patient would be a candidate for both conventional
PTCA to attempt to repair the left circumflex coronary artery.
However , the patient's severe coronary artery disease lead the
interventional radiologists to consider the patient for a laser
wire type of PTCA in the event that PTCA was not successful. As
the laser wire PTCA was not available for several days , it was
decided to have Mr. Lienhard remain as an inpatient on heparin to
maintain a PTT of 60-80 while awaiting the laser wire guided PTCA.
Three days following admission , while awaiting PTCA , the patient
had one episode of chest pain that he reports resolved in less than
three minutes with one sublingual nitroglycerin tablet. The
patient denied shortness of breath , palpitations , or diaphoresis.
Since that time , the patient remained totally stable with no
further events of chest pain and no EKG changes noted. The patient
was begun on 250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d. two days prior to his
catheterization procedure.
On March , 1996 , five days after admission , the patient
successfully underwent PTCA of his left circumflex artery which had
previously had a 100% stenosis. The patient had two stents placed
in the left circumflex artery , leaving a 0% residual lesion. The
patient tolerated the procedure well , returned to the floor. The
catheterization sheaths were removed six hours after the procedure.
Examination the following morning revealed no further bleeding , no
hematoma , and good pulses distally , as well as a warm and dry left
lower extremity. As the patient tolerated the procedure well and
had no further complications , it was decided that the patient could
be discharged the day following his catheterization , maintained on
250 mg of Ticlid b.i.d.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone
25 mg p.o. q.a.m. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o.
q.h.s. , atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.day , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.day.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Mr. Ruesswick will be discharged in stable
condition following his PTCA from the day
before. The patient will be discharged to home.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Wilburn Ducceschi ,
his outside hospital cardiologist , in one to two weeks.
We suspect that Mr. Danco will be able to return to his normal
activities of daily living without any further disability.
