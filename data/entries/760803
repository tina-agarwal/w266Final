HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 42-year-old , G3 , P0 who
presented to Labor and Delivery on 11/4/2003 at 32-4/7 weeks
gestation , dated by a 7-week ultrasound with class B diabetes
mellitus and an increased blood pressure. The patient denied
headaches , visual changes , and epigastric pain. She did report a
16-pound weight gain over the past two weeks and she had 4+
protein on urine dip in the clinic that day. The patient is
treated with insulin for her class B diabetes mellitus during
pregnancy. The patient's prenatal screens are notable for Rh
positive , antibody negative , RPR nonreactive , Gonorrhea and
Chlamydia negative , hemoglobin electrophoresis AA , hepatitis B
surface antigen negative , TSH was 2.02 , hemoglobin A1C on
3/18/2002 was 8.7 , on 5/5/2002 was 9.4 and a chorionic villus
sampling procedure revealing normal chromosomes. As stated
above , the patient is dated by a 7-week ultrasound. Her current
pregnancy has been followed by Dr. Shelton Reges in the Diabetes
Clinic from 8 weeks of gestation. Her prenatal course is notable
for a history of chronic hypertension. Her blood pressure was
122/70 , range of blood pressures during pregnancy was 100/60 to
130/80. The patient did not require medications during this
pregnancy for blood pressure control. Today in clinic , the
patient had a blood pressure of 158/90 with 4+ protein on dip.
She denied signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. The patient's
second prenatal issue is a history of class B type2 diabetes
mellitus , on insulin. Her most recent hemoglobin A1C was 6.6 on
11/7/2003 . The patient's baseline 24-hour urine protein was 59
mg. The patient had good fetal growth on ultrasound. At a
25-week scan , fetal weight was estimated to be 973 g in the 91st
percentile with a normal survey. At 28 weeks , the fetus was
1 , 370 g in the 86th percentile with normal Dopplers. At 32
weeks , the fetus was 1 , 976 g on 11/4/2003 in the 66th percentile
with normal fluids , anterior placenta , vertex position , normal
Dopplers and normal survey. The patient's third issue in the
pregnancy was morbid obesity with a high BMI. The patient's
fourth issue was advanced maternal age. She is status post a
chorionic villus sampling for normal chromosomes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus ,
diagnosed 2 years ago. The patient was treated with oral
glyburide until 6 weeks pregnant and then switched to insulin.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Excision of right facial sebaceous cyst ,
therapeutic abortion x 2.
PAST OB HISTORY: G3 , P0020. Therapeutic TAB in the first
trimester at age 16 , therapeutic TAB in the second trimester at
age 18.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: NPH and Humalog insulin , regimen adjusted according
to blood sugars and prenatal vitamins.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Blood pressure 160/80 ,
afebrile , no acute distress. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft ,
obese , nontender and gravid. Extremities: Showed 3+ edema with
2+ deep tendon reflexes. Fetal heart tones were 140s and
reactive , vertex position for the fetus by Leopold and
ultrasound.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery
for rule out preeclampsia. Her initial laboratory studies
revealed a creatinine of 0.8 , platelets of 323 , ALT 39 , AST 30 ,
uric acid 5.6 , 24-hour urine protein was 2 , 995 mg. The patient
was managed on the labor floor , ruling in for preeclampsia. She
was started on magnesium sulfate therapy for seizure prophylaxis
and she was begun on betamethasone treatment for fetal lung
maturity. Her glucose levels were watched carefully after the
administration of betamethasone. She remained stable. After the
patient was betamethasone complete on 11/13/2003 , an induction of
labor was started using cervical ripening agents. The patient
received Cervidil x 1 , Cytotec x 4 , Foley bulb mechanical
dilatation and low dose Pitocin. After this , she reached 1 cm
dilatation , 25% effacement , -3 station. At this point on
4/24/2003 , due to the failure of initiating labor with cervical
ripening agents and Foley bulb , a decision was made to proceed
with laminaria to mechanically dilate the cervix further. On
4/24/2003 , 28 laminaria were placed in the patient's cervix and
the patient was restarted on Pitocin. The laminaria were
discontinued and the patient was examined and found to be 3-4 cm ,
50% with a high station. She was continued on Pitocin for
protocol and her cervix did not change. Therefore , the patient
was consented for cesarean section for failure to progress with
induction of labor and severe preeclampsia. The patient had
remained stable in regards to her preeclampsia with stable blood
pressures. On 5/18/2003 , the patient underwent a primary
cesarean section , low transverse for delivery of a 3 pound 7
ounce vigorous infant at 4:35 a.m. , 5/18/2003 . Apgars were 7 at
1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes respectively. The patient tolerated
the procedure well. A JP drain was placed in the subcutaneous
tissue due to the patient's morbid obesity. The patient's
postpartum course was notable for restarting the patient on oral
antihypertensives and continuing to monitor her fingerstick blood
glucose levels. The patient was started on hydrochlorothiazide
and lisinopril , which she had been taking prior to pregnancy.
Her fingersticks were checked and she was covered with a Humalog
sliding scale. She was on subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis. The patient's Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued
prior to her discharge and staples were to remain in place for 10
days. The patient was discharged to home with Visiting Nurse
Services to monitor her blood pressure and her fingersticks. The
patient was to followup with Dr. Spencer Jensrud for further
management of her diabetes and hypertension.
