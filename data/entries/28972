upper lobectomy on June , 2001 , for a T1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma
of the lung. He was recently found to have a new right upper lobe nodule
by chest CT scan.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a right mini-thoracotomy , RUL
wedge resection , and mediastinal lymph node dissection , 5/5/2006 . The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to

advanced to a full house diet , his oxygen was weaned to room air , and his
home medications were restarted. POD #1 , following resolution of the air
leak and minimal output , the patient's chest tube was removed. A post
pull CXR showed a small apical space. POD #2 , the chest x-ray showed the
apical space to be stable. His epidural was capped and removed , foley
catheter removed and he voided without difficulty.
