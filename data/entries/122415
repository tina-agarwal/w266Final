===================================================
HPI: 75 yo F h/o AS , DM , SSS s/p PM , HTN , restrictive lung dz presenting

negative for pneumonia and she was sent to the ED for further workup of
her worsening SOB.
Of note patient reported that she had 4 falls in the past 2 months , most
recently 1 month ago. And she had a negative workup by her PCP ,
pulmonologist , and cardiologist.

assessment of smaller vessels. No evidence of or deep venous
thrombosis.
2. Mediastinal and mild upper abdominal lymphadenopathy may
warrant further evaluation or follow-up imaging.
3. Elevation of right hemidiaphragm with associated atelectasis
unchanged from prior studies.
===================================================
CONSULTS: None
===================================================
ASSESSMENT:
75 yo F with h/o AS , SSS s/p PM , DM2 , restrictive lung disease presenting
with acute onset of cough , fever , and worsening shortness of breath over
the past three days.
Pt has a long history of SOB and recently several episodes of falls
managed by her PCP , cardiologist , and pulmonologist. Workup has thus far
been negative for cardiac causes including new arrhythmias ,
malfunctioning pacemaker or worsening AS per echo done 1/16/07 at ASCRH . 
Elective cath done on 2/4/07 at TMC showed minimal CAD. The most
recent visit to her pulmonolgist two months ago revealed stable pulmonary
function. Recent CXRs done at SBH suggest there may be a component of
pulmonary edema , her presentation at this admission not consistent with
worsening pulmonary edema from heart failure of valvular disease.
An atypical presenation for MI was also ruled out by enzymes.
Given her acute onset of cough with a fever , the most likely etiology is
infectious exacerbated by her poor pulmonary reserve.
=============================================
HOSPITAL COURSE:
--------------
1 ) PULMONARY: Pt kept on ceftriaxone and azithromycin despite a negative
CXR and chest PT because of concern for CAP in pt with poor pulmonary
reserve. Presentation most consistent with a viral etiology. Symptoms
responded well to duonebs and robitussin prn. On HD#2 , patient's
breathing markedly improved and was able to wean off of O2 able to sat
95% on room air. Pt was able to ambulate on room air without dropping O2
saturation below 90%. Patient was d/c to home on azithromycin and
albuterol inhaler.
2 ) CV: Cariac enzymes were negative. Patient was kept on her home
regimen of ASA , toprol , lisinopril , hctz.
3 ) DM2: Oral meds were held on admission and pt switched to NPH +
prandial aspart.
4 ) FEN: low fat , low cholesterol diet , K/Mg scales. Tolerated PO's
5 ) Ppx: DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox 40 mg sc qd.
