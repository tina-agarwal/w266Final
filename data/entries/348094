with a history of CAD and previous MI , angioplasty in 1995 and
stent placement in 2001 , complained about episodes of shortness
of breath and increasing intolerance of physical activity. He
was using nitroglycerin and rest during such an episode with
obvious success. His cardiac catheterization was done at WLH
which revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease with EF of

surgery. Date of surgery 2/10/05.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: CAD.
PROCEDURE: CABG x3 with LIMA to LAD , sequential graft , SVG1
connects aorta to VK7 then PDA. Bypass time 97 minutes. Circa
arrest for 5 minutes. There were no complications. The patient
was transferred to the unit in stable fashion with lines and
tubes intact.
ICU PROGRESS EVENT SUMMARY: 4/25/05 , postop day #1 , hypotensive
low SVR , vasopressin started , rising creatinine. 3/3/05 ,
postoperative day #2 , started on dopamine for oliguria and rising
creatinine. 11/12/05 , postop day #3 , creatinine down to 1.4 ,
episode of bradycardia. Postop day #4 , continued on dopamine at
2 mcg , continued high chest tube output. Official echo report
essentially unchanged. Postop day #5 , weaned off dopamine , left
chest tube discontinued , persistent SVG harvesting site bleed.
Postop day #6 , 11/29/05 , no significant events , medial chest
tubes were discontinued without complications. The patient was
transferred to the Step-Down Unit on 11/29/05 , postop day #6.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologically: Intact.
Cardiovascular: On aspirin , has pacemaker for sick sinus.
Battery is low , cannot pace above 65 beats per minute with plans
to exchange generator. Pressure is better , paced externally at
90 BPM.
Respiratory: Saturating well on 2 liters of oxygen delivered by
nasal cannula so was moderate chest tube output.
Diet: Advanced as tolerated.
Renal: Postop increase in creatinine requiring dopamine ,
creatinine now down to 1.5. P.o. Lasix started.
Endocrine: No issues.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with aspirin.
ID: Antibiotics are off. Afebrile.
Elevated white count secondary to myelofibrosis. Transferred to
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #6. Postop day #7 , 8/3/05 ,
last remaining chest tube removed. Patient still complains of
shortness of breath , saturating well on room air. Chest x-ray
looked slightly wet but nothing significant noted. Echo showed
moderate TR. No changes from prior echos. Send troponin , BNP to
help rule out PE per cards , very slow to ambulate , needs PT ,
probably rehab , is being paced to 70 BPM with external V wire ,
has internal pacer working at 60 beats per minute but needs
battery change by EPS.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Clam wants him on low flow O2 for
time being. 1/14/05 , postop day #8 , sinus rhythm 2 liters ,
patient with bilateral lower extremity DVT's , right IJ clot , and
left upper extremity DVT as well , started on argatroban , PTT to
titrate the goal of 50/70. HIT screen came back positive.
Hematology , following recommended vascular consult for blue
fingers and toes. If color on extremities does not improve on
argatroban , will get vascular to see. So far color in right hand
looks better. Left fingers and toes bilaterally , no worse , no
better. Respiratory status worsens , consider CT angiogram with
contrast to rule out PE with Mucomyst given creatinine of 2.1.
Blood cultures sent for white count. The patient with left chest
effusion , will get chest ultrasound once stable , still has wires
in and being externally paced at 70 until internal PPM can have
battery change. 9/15/05 , postop day #9 , HIT positive with
worsening clinical syndrome. Positive DVT's in all extremities ,

rehabilitation on 7/24/06 with the following discharge
instructions.
DIET: Osmolite 1.2 tube feeds at 80 cc an hour with plans to
advance p.o. as swallow function improved.
FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Leaird , 282-008-4347 in 5-6 weeks ,
Dr. Tanaka , 5324-517-0379 in 1-2 weeks , Dr. Suriel 465-337-2375 in
1-2 weeks , Dr. Peshek OOGMCAGHC Plastics at 305-235-4279 in 7-10 days.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: The patient should have speech and swallow
follow up while at rehab for ongoing evaluation of swallow
function. He is going to rehabilitation with Dobbhoff tube in
place for feeding with plans to advance diet to p.o. intake once
swallow function improves. Mr. Lesley Cusmano should not receive any
heparin products , he has HIT and has required anticoagulation
therapy/surgical amputation as a result.
TO DO PLAN: Make all follow-up appointments , local wound care ,
wash wounds daily with soap and water , shower patient daily.
Please follow HH Plastic Surgery Service records for dressing
changes , bilateral lower extremities and left wrist. Watch
wounds for signs of infection , redness , swelling , fever , pain ,
discharge. Call PCP/cardiologist or JH Cardiac Surgery Service
at 282-008-4347 with any questions or Dr. Boldenow at 305-235-4279
