ATTENDING: SAMMET , SHANNON AMOS MD
SERVICE:
Cardiac Surgery Service.
For the beginning of this dictation , I am going to defer to a
pervious discharge summary dictation dictated by Dr. Antony D Tirino . Confirmation number is 196925. It was dictated on
0/27/05 , therefore this dictation will continue over the
hospital course starting on 10/13/05 , at which time , the patient
was transferred to the Step-Down Unit. We began weaning the
milrinone drip as well as titrating up on her diltiazem and
Neoral. The patient was seen by Speech and Swallow and her diet
was liberalized to thin liquids. She was restarted on her
diuresis. The patient began having positive blood cultures on
10/0/05 .  One out of two bottles from 2/28/05 grew out
Gram-positive cocci , but the patient remained afebrile and her
white blood cell count was trending down. Further blood cultures
were sent off. Central line was discontinued on 11/29/05 and tip
was sent for culture. Further blood cultures were negative but
the line tip grew out coag-negative Staph. Echocardiogram
results revealed an ejection fraction of 55% , mild mitral
regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation and
moderate pericardial effusion , without evidence of hemodynamic
compromise. The patient underwent a cardiac biopsy on 6/14/05 ,
which showed focal healing ischemic injury. Despite all negative
cultures , the patient continued on vancomycin , Bactrim ,
levofloxacin and Valcyte. Speech and Swallow then started
regular solids and thin liquid. Her medications continued to be
monitored by the Congestive Heart Failure Service. She did
become slightly hypertensive and they increased her diltiazem.
She continued on her antibiotics. There is a PICC line attempted
to be placed on 8/6/05 , however , they were unable to withdraw.
Therefore , they would return in the morning to attempt it again.
Upper extremity and LENIs were done , which was negative for clot ,
except for in the left cephalic. Congestive heart failure people
then suggested that maybe it would be best that the patient just
stayed in the hospital without getting a PICC line to complete
her course of antibiotics. She also was going to need a repeat
right heart catheterization and biopsy. Her antibiotic course
was finished on 9/20/05 .  Only other issue was that the patient
was seen by Ophthalmology and it was recommended that she will
need reading glasses when she is at home. Diabetes management
continued to follow the patient and congestive heart failure did
as well. She underwent a right heart catheterization as well as
biopsy on 4/23/05 , which demonstrated normal left and right
filling pressures. They were 6 and 14. The patient was found
suitable for discharge to home on 4/23/05 .  At the time of
discharge , Ms. Hawker looked great. Her temperature was 96 ,
heart rate was 96 sinus , blood pressure was 110/80. She was
satting 99% on room air. Her weight was even from preop.
