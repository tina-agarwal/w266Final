A/P 86 yo F w/ CAD s/p PCI , AS s/p AVR , sss s/p PPM w/ several episodes
of CP in last 2 months that come on with fear and anxiety and worsening
DOE now p/w another episode of chest pressure at rest. Ddx anxiety , ACS ,
diastolic heart failure , bioprosthetic vavle dysfunction.
*CVI: Known CAD , MIBI w/ perfusion defect , chest pressure at rest w/ no
new EKG changes. The history is suggestive of non-cardiac chest pain
( comes on with anxiety/fear , occurs at rest , no chest pain w/ exertion ).
The patient ruled out for MI with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
She remained chest pain free throught course of admission , however , did
have occasional shortness anxiety attacks with shortness of breath that
relieved with low dose ativan. The patient will continue ASA , BB ,
zocor. Lipids ( chol 119 , Tri 142 , HDL 135 , LDL 56 ). We increased her dose
of imdur for better bp control and symptomatic relief of angina ( although
likley not having true angina ). She will follow-up with her cardiologist
Dr. Rubin Farahkhan .

admitted for volume overload requiring diuresis. Durnig this
admission the patient appeared euvolemic. We continued her home dose of
lasix. The patient did have some hypertension w/ sbp in 150s. We split
her norvasc into bid dosing for tighter control and increased imdur. May
need to have anti-hypertensive up-titrated as outpatient. Patient is not
on an ACE inhibitor because of angioedema. An echo cardiogram pending
at time of discharge and should be followed up as OP.
*CVR: no issues
*Pulm: ***HIGH SUSPICION FOR LUNG CA*** given smoking hx and
recent enlarging pulmonary nodule in RLL w/ sm R pleural effusion. Needs
to have an further outpatient workup. Patient also has a hx of BOOP 2/2
bleomycin and diastolic heart failure all of which may contribute to her
DOE.

FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: To Patient: You were admitted to the hospital to rule out a heart attack
as the cause for your chest pain. Based on our evaluation we feel that
your chest pain is atypical and most likely not related to your heart.
We have made a few changes to your medications. We increased your dose
of imdur from 30mg to 60mg , we changed your norvasc from 10mg daily to
5mg twice per day and we added ativan on an as needed basis for anxiety
and agitation. If you develope recurrent chest pain , shortness of breath
or other concerning symptoms please contact a physician. You may try
taking ativan when you have chest pain especially if the chest pain is
brought on by fear or anxiety. Please follow-up with your PCP in the
next 1-2 weeks to be sure that you are tolerating the changes in
medications well.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
***ENLARGING PULM NODULE W/ PLUERAL EFFUSION*** High suspicion for Ca and
needs further OP work-up
*Up-titrate bp medications for better control
*Have patient follow-up with Dr. Appelgren ( cardiology )
