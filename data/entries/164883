Cardiac catheterization data performed on 4/18/06 , coronary
anatomy 70% proximal LAD , 70% mid OM1 , 30% ostial OM1 , 90%
proximal RCA , 100% mid RCA , 90% proximal ramus , right dominant
circulation.
ECG on 8/7/06 showed normal sinus rhythm at 77 with multiple
PVCs , left anterior hemiblock and right bundle-branch block.
Chest x-ray on 8/7/06 was read as normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
BRIEF OPERATIVE NOTE:
DATE OF SURGERY:
8/15/06 .
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
PROCEDURE:
CABG x4 , sequential graft , SVG1 connects aorta to ramus and then
OM1 , LIMA to LAD , SVG2 to RCA.
BYPASS TIME:
93 minutes.
CROSSCLAMP TIME:
79 minutes.
One ventricular wire , two pericardial tubes , one left pleural
tube placed. The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass on 4 of
insulin.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
While in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit , his course was
complicated by the following:
1. Although the patient had an allergy of syncope caused by
atenolol , he was started on another beta-blocker Lopressor.
He has not had any complications from this
medication. He was later transitioned to Toprol in anticipation
of his discharge.
2. He also had a low hematocrit while in the cardiac intensive
care unit and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Since that time , his hematocrit has remained stable. He was
transferred to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit on postoperative day
#2. While on the Cardiac Step-Down Unit , his course was
complicated by the following:
1. The patient was initially hypertensive upon transfer to
cardiac step-down unit and started on captopril. His
hypertension appears to be under control at this time.
Otherwise , all epicardial pacing wires and chest tubes were
removed without complication and he was weaned from his oxygen
requirement and diuresed to approximately her preoperative
weight.
He will be discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative day #5
on the following medications:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. daily , captopril
6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg
