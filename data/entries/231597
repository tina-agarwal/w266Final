p.o.

hypotension. These were gradually weaned off. Her wires were
removed on postoperative day #3. At that time of transfer , her
heart rate was 90s-100s , sinus rhythm with systolic blood
pressures of 80s-90s. The patient was orthostatic on getting out
of bed on the morning of transfer. She was given a normal saline
250 cc bolus prior to transfer. At the time of transfer , she was
receiving Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.6h.

#0. At the time of transfer , she was receiving supplemental
oxygen 4 liters per minute with an O2 saturation of 94%. Her
chest tubes have been removed the prior day. Post removal chest
x-ray showed a questionable small left pleural effusion. The
lungs were otherwise clear.
4. GI: The patient was tolerating a regular diet at the time of
transfer.

NovoLog 4 units subcu before meals; and NovoLog sliding scale.
7. Heme: The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells on postoperative day #1 for hematocrit of 22 with
associated hypotension and oliguria. At the time of transfer ,
the patient was receiving Plavix for poor targets. She was also
