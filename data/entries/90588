IMP: 60 yo woman with history of CAD and chronic pain syndrome , presenting
with 2 day history of chest pain and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CV( I ): With history of CAD and symptoms consistent with new
ischemia , pt was admitted for ROMI. Ruled out with 3 sets of negative
cardiac biomarkers. Underwent myocardial perfusion PET-CT which showed
EF 58% with small area of scarring unchanged from previous study in 2004.
Continued home regimen of ASA , Labetalol , Candesartan , Lisinopril ,
Norvasc , and Plavix. Substituted Simvastatin for Lipitor.
2. CV( P ): On admission , pt appeared euvolemic on exam , with significant
hypertension , thought to be secondary to pain. Continued home
hypertensive regimen , as well as Lasix 40mg BID. Pt's
hypertension did improve with pain control. However , pt's creatinine
increased from 1.2 to 1.8 and pt appeared dry on 3rd day of admission.
Lasix was held and pt was given gentle IVF , which resolved ARF to Cr 1.3.
Pt has been instructed to hold her Lasix until Monday 1/19/07 , upon which
she will resume at 40mg daily. She will follow-up with her PCP next week to
assess need to adjust Lasix dosing.
3. CV( R ): Monitored on telemetry with no events.
4. GI: No active issues. Continued PPI.
5. PAIN: Continued home pain med regimen of Oxycontin 60mg q8h plus
oxycodone 5-10mg q4-6h prn for breakthrough. Pt continued to have
significant pain which presented in different locations. Most significant
was right breast/right underarm pain. Suspected etiology of this pain is
exacerbation of chronic pain syndrome vs musculoskeletal. Heating pads
offered some relief. Pt's pain was improved by discharge with no specific
intervention. Pt will follow-up with PCP to assess resolution of pain.
6. PSYCH: Pt has significant anxiety regarding lack of specific
diagnosis for her increased pain. Also expresses considerable amount
of anxiety/depression over life stressors ( son in Sterl Tuc Wau , recent death of
sister ). Suspect that anxiety/depression may be significantly contributing
to increased pain. Psychiatry was consulted who felt that pt was
expressing normal bereavement and that anti-depressant medication was
not indicated at this time. They recommended follow-up in the
Psychiatry outpatient clinic , for which the patient has been provided
a phone number to call. Pt felt significant improvement of anxiety
after talking to Psychiatry consult. Psych recommended Ativan prn for
anxiety , and pt was given prescription for Ativan 0.5 mg PO prn
for anxiety.
7. RENAL: Pt had ARF on day 3 with increased Cr 1.8 up from 1.3.
Likely dehydration as pt appeared clinically dry. Gave IVF and
held Lasix. Renal U/S was normal ruling out obstuctive etiology. With
hydration , pt creatinine normalized to 1.3 on day of discharge. Pt will hold
Lasix until Monday 1/19/07 , then resume at 40mg daily. Pt will follow-up
with PCP regarding adjusting Lasix dosing as needed.
