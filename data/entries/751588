Discharge Date: 4/22/1997
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Myocardial infarction.
PROBLEM LIST: 1. Status post acute myocardial infarction.
2. Prostate cancer diagnosed July 1997; status post radiation
therapy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old man
without prior cardiac history. He has
cardiac risk factors including possible hypertension , and possible
history of hypercholesterolemia. The patient has had a history of
atypical chest pain , including a cardiac workup in the past with an
echocardiogram in 1995 showing concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy , asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He had a normal
ejection fraction at this time. In March of 1997 , he had an
exercise tolerance test at which time he went eight minutes , with a
maximal heart rate of 151 , maximal blood pressure 226/90 , and no
electrocardiogram changes. At 2 p.m. on the day of admission he
developed substernal chest pain with a crushing tightness ,
radiating to both shoulders and his jaw. He was not short of
breath. He experiences pain on and off through the afternoon ,
although the pain was never completely gone. At 6 p.m. , he became
acutely worse , and at that time called the EMT and was brought to
Nama Emergency Department. Within the
Emergency Department , the patient was noted to have ST elevations
in the inferior leads. He was enrolled in the NPA/TPA trial.
Infusion was begun at 8:15. The patient was given Lopressor ,
oxygen , morphine , aspirin , and heparin. He did not drop his
pressure with sublingual nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history includes prostate
cancer in July 1997 , status post XRT , as well
as a possible transient ischemic attack in 1990.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Medications included Zantac p.r.n.
FAMILY HISTORY: Family history was negative for coronary artery
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married with three children. He
denies any tobacco or alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission
demonstrated a well-appearing black male in
no acute distress. Vital signs were a heart rate of 48 , blood
pressure 83/30 in the Emergency Department , he was afebrile , with
oxygen saturation level 99 percent on two liters. HEENT
examination , the oropharynx is benign , he had a left facial droop.
The neck was supple , 2+ carotids without bruit. Jugular venous
distention was normal. The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. The heart had a regular bradycardic rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen was soft , non-tender ,
non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no organomegaly. The
extremities were warm and well-perfused , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema , trace distal pulses. Neurologically , he was alert and
oriented x three , cranial nerves 2 through 12 are grossly intact
except for a left facial droop. Motor and sensory were grossly
intact.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Admission labs showed a sodium of 144 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate of
22 , BUN 16 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 136. White count was 8 with a
hematocrit of 35 , platelets were 239 , CK was 276 with an MB of 0.8.
Troponin on admission was 0.0. INR was 1.0 , partial thromboplastin
time was 22.6. The patient's first electrocardiogram in the
Emergency Department showed normal sinus rhythm at 70 with
first-degree AV block , axis of 56 degrees. He had ST elevations of
4 millimeters in leads 3 and aVF , 3 millimeters in 2 , ST depression
0.5 to 3 millimeters V2 through V5 , 1 and aVL. Chest x-ray did not
showed acute disease in the Emergency Department.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Within the Emergency Department , the patient
initially had resolution of his electrocardiogram
changes , but had persistent jaw pain , remaining at 5/10. He was
taken to catheterization , which demonstrated a mid right coronary
artery lesion of approximately 95 percent with a clot , but with
TIMI-III flow. No intervention was done at that time. The patient
initially required vigorous intravenous hydration to maintain good
blood pressure , but remained essentially stable and pain-free. He
had a drop in hematocrit from 35 on admission to 28 after his
catheterization secondary to blood loss of the right femoral triple
lumen site placed in the Emergency Ward prior to tPA , blood loss at
catheterization , small hematoma and dilution. He was given two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in his
hematocrit. The patient was then transferred to the Floor , where
he maintained his good course. He had no postcatheterization or
post myocardial infarction chest pain. The decision was then made
to take the patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory to have
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting of
this lesion , and to see if it continued to persist.
