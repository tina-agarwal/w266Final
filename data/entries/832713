BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 63-year-old man with
coronary artery today disease status post CABG , diabetes
mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , status post bilateral
below-the-knee amputations , end-stage renal disease - on
hemodialysis , and metastatic prostate cancer presenting with
new-onset ascites. He notes that since his last below-the-knee
amputation in 6/4 , he has noticed increased abdominal girth ,
smaller after hemodialysis. He denies fevers , chills , jaundice ,
abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or bright red blood
per rectum. He has had some weight loss. He denies PND ,
orthopnea , or lower extremity swelling. On the day of admission ,
the patient was in the preoperative area for revision of his
below-the-knee amputation of the right leg because it had poor
wound healing. During the preoperative evaluation , however , it
was noticed that he had significant abdominal swelling. He was ,
therefore , admitted to the medicine for further workup and
evaluation.

PROCEDURES: 7/17/2007 , therapeutic paracentesis , 4 liters of
ascitic fluid removed without complication. Chemistries and cell
counts of ascitic fluid as described above in the laboratory
section.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with history of
end-stage renal disease - on hemodialysis , coronary artery
disease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status post
bilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months of
worsening ascites of unclear etiology. His hospital course by
problem is as follows:
1. Gastrointestinal: The patient underwent a therapeutic
paracentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with total
protein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradient
greater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likely
due to volume overload with resultant right heart failure.
Ascites had 460 white blood cells with 20% polys. Therefore , it
was not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Ascitic fluids were negative for growth of bacteria and cytology
of the ascitic fluids identified no malignant cells. After
consultation with the cardiology service , it was concluded that
the ascites was due to massive volume overload , and therefore the
patient should undergo reduction of volume through
ultrafiltration at dialysis. This process was begun as an
inpatient by the renal service. While the patient was an
inpatient , efforts to remove fluid was complicated by
development of hypotension during dialysis as
well as by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
with heart rates up to the 140s. Due to the difficulties with
removing fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option of
undergoing ultrafiltration by CVVH or an ultrafiltration machine ,
but the patient and the family declined to participate in such
care. It should also be noted that despite our efforts , the
patient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were put
into place in the patient's diet order , therefore also making it
difficult to treat the patient's volume overload. The patient
was discharged with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatient
dialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce the
patient's volume overload. This plan was communicated by the
attending renal , Dr. Simon Esbrandt , to the patient's outpatient renal
attending , Dr. Archie Chhum .
2. Renal: As described above , the patient has end-stage renal
disease - on hemodialysis. As described above , ultrafiltration
was attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possible
and to reduce the patient's volume overloaded state.
Ultrafiltration should be continued as an outpatient to continue
to attempt to counteract the patient's volume overload.
3. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , the patient has a history of
coronary artery disease status post CABG and stent , but his usual
aspirin and Plavix were initially held given that surgical
revision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned.
However , after discussion with the patient's vascular surgeon ,
Dr. Herb Piecuch , it was decided that the patient's volume
overload should be corrected prior to his undergoing surgical
revision of his right leg. Therefore , aspirin and Plavix were
restarted on 6/24/2007 .  Pump: The patient has evidence of
right heart failure by echocardiogram. On physical exam and as
described above , this is likely a consequence of the patient's
volume overload. Again , as described above , volume was removed
through ultrafiltration at dialysis. Rhythm: The patient has a
history of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likely
for fear of noncompliance. The patient was in normal sinus
rhythm for the majority of this admission but on 6/29/2007 , the
patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular with
rates to the 120s to 140s. However , the patient refused to
accept monitoring on cardiac telemetry and also refused to
cooperate with the administration of intravenous medications for
heart rate control. Therefore , the patient's dose of oral
Lopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his blood
pressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s and
were not optimally controlled. However , the patient refused
further management of his atrial fibrillation , and it was
therefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatient
with continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blocker
regimen.
4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on his home insulin
regimen and fingersticks were monitored on a q.a.c. and nightly
basis with adequate control of blood sugars.
5. Vascular: As described above , the patient has a right
below-the-knee amputation , which need surgical revision. As
described above , after discussion with the patient's vascular
surgeon , Dr. Mel Bierut , it was decided that the patient's
surgical revision of his right leg would be addressed after his
issues with volume overload are resolved.
6. Infectious disease: It was noted that the patient has as a
likely paronychia of his left index finger. Plain films were
obtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. A
hand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that there
were no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgent
surgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. The
patient was treated with oral levofloxacin and will continue
taking levofloxacin for a total of 3-week course to end on
10/12/2007 .  Oxycodone was administered for pain control of his
left finger as well as for pain control of his right leg.
Prophylaxis , the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin for
DVT prophylaxis and placed on Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
The patient was full code during this admission.
PHYSICIAN FOLLOWUP PLANS: The patient has a followup appointment
with his vascular surgeon , Dr. Huey Lamond , on 0/22/2007 at
2:30 p.m. , phone number 030-524-6194. The patient should call
his doctor his primary care physician , Dr. Jamal Gehlert ,
telephone #782-497-8147 , for appointment in two to three weeks.
The patient will continue dialysis at Gentville under the
direction of Dr. Alphonso Berwald on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday
schedule. This patient should complete a total of 14-day course
of levofloxacin to end on 10/12/2007 for his left fourth finger
paronychia/skin infection. The patient's beta-blocker should be
titrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for better
control of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. As described
above , ultrafiltration should be used during dialysis to remove
total body volume.
