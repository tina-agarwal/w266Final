044020768 | HLH | 29970772 | | 534711 | 3/21/2002 12:00:00 AM | CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 9/9/2002 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 7/20/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old man with
ischemic cardiomyopathy , estimated EF
15-20% who presents with an 8-10 pound weight gain over the past
3-5 days , increased fatigue. Also reports increased shortness of
breath which has progressed over the past few months and notes that
he now gets shortness of breath after walking as few as 10-20
steps. He also complains of lightheadedness but denies chest pain ,
palpitations. He also complains of occasional sweats and chills
without nausea , diarrhea , constipation , melena , or bright red blood
per rectum. He reports that lately his blood sugars have been
lower than usual , in the 40s-80s. Denies orthopnea , PND , or lower
extremity edema. Denies dietary indiscretions or medical
noncompliance. However , there is a recent history of discontinuing
certain medications and the patient is unclear to which medications
he should actually be taking at this point.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in 1979 and 1985 ,
status post three-vessel CABG in 1987 , ischemic cardiomyopathy ,
estimated ejection fraction 15-20% , cardiac cirrhosis ,
hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis , gallstones , irritable bowel
syndrome , psoriasis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Torsemide , Synthroid 100 mcg p.o.q.d.;
Lantus 98 units subcu q. a.m.; potassium
60 mEq p.o. b.i.d.; Humalog insulin 12 units subcu q. a.m. and q.
p.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Xanax p.r.n.; Prozac 40 mg p.o.
q. a.m.; Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d.;
Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Aldactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. Per patient
his digoxin , Captopril and Aldactone have been on hold. Apparently
these were held after a clinic visit on 2/30/02 via Dr. Mcmeans
when the patient was complaining of orthostatic symptoms and his
torsemide was held over the past five days prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.8 , heart rate
72 , blood pressure 91/63 , breathing 95% on
room air. GENERAL: This is a comfortable , pleasant gentleman in
no acute distress. Alert and oriented x 3. HEENT: Normocephalic ,
atraumatic. Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Moist mucous
membranes. NECK: JVP estimated at 12 cm/water. LUNGS: Decreased
breath sounds at bases , otherwise clear to auscultation.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No heart
sounds. No murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender , obese. EXTREMITIES: Warm , no clubbing , cyanosis or
edema. 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 1.2 , troponin-I 0.06.
Electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 67 beats/minute , first
degree AV block , left axis deviation , right bundle branch block. Q
waves in II , III and AVF consistent with old inferior infarct. All
these findings unchanged from the prior EKG in 10/7
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1. ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3. VOLUME OVERLOAD.
4. DIABETES MELLITUS.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient on admission was
clinically volume overloaded. He was diuresed
with torsemide IV boluses with good response. He was diuresing two
liters negative per day on torsemide IV or p.o. as well as
spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. However , his clinical volume status
were difficult to assess and accordingly on 7/10/02 he underwent
right heart catheterization and tailored therapy. By report his
right atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , his
wedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37
indicating that he still has substantial volume overload. On
therapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease his
systemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance with
success with low doses of Captopril. His PA catheter was
discontinued on 5/9/02. He has continued to be diuresed with
torsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. He should
be at or near euvolemia on 2/28/02 and he was discharged on a
diuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone
25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
Ischemia: There were no ischemic issues during this hospital
admission.
Rhythm: Electrocardiogram with first degree AV block. The patient
was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. No
evidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. No further workup
was pursued from a rhythm standpoint.
2 ) Endocrine: The patient had a history of hypothyroidism. It is
unclear how this came to be but at some point in the past his
Synthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.
He had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. When
he was restarted on Synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,
Dr. Escudero , his Synthroid was started at a relatively low dose and
titrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy and
there was concern that increasing his dose too quickly would
precipitate angina. On admission his TSH was 50 and after some
discussion with Dr. Pimpare his Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg
p.o.q.d. On 5/16/02 an endocrine consult was requested because on
2/14/02 his repeat TSH of 75.8 , T4 of 6.5 and a THBR of 1.10.
Endocrine consult recommended increasing Synthroid to 150 mcg
p.o.q.d. and slowly titrating Synthroid upwards by no more than 25
mcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowly
titrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.
Further management of his hypothyroidism could be done on an
outpatient basis.
The patient also on admission had a history of Type II diabetes
maintained on insulin. His insulin doses had been titrated
downwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of low
fingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet while
in the hospital. He required only 60 units of Lantus insulin q.
a.m. He was discharged on that dose with Humalog 10 units subcu q.
a.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwards
by his outpatient endocrinologist , Dr. Wakeham
3 ) Psychiatric: The patient had a history of depression and
during this admission he was maintained on his outpatient
medications of Prozac and Restoril. His Prozac dose was titrated
upwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. He
was discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. No further
psychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during his
inpatient stay. His mood remained stable during this admission.
4 ) Renal: The patient's creatinine was monitored throughout his
hospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. No
further renal evaluation or intervention was required during this
hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient was discharged on 2/28/02 on e
following medications: spironolactone 25
mg p.o.q.d.; Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; simvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Lantus insulin 60 units
subcu q. a.m.; Humalog insulin 10 units subcu q. a.m. and q. p.m.;
K-Dur 40 mEq p.o.q.d.; Synthroid 150 mcg p.o.q.d.; Prozac 60 mg
p.o. q. a.m.; Restoril 30 mg p.o.q.d.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , DIABETES MELLITUS ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DEPRESSION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY , VOLUME OVERLOAD ,
HYPOTHYROIDISM , DIABETES MELLITUS , DEPRESSION.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged in stable
condition afebrile on 2/28/02 without
shortness of breath , without chest pain , without any complaints.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home with VNA arranged to visit him
on 10/19/02 for the first time to monitor his weight ,
to monitor his electrolytes and to monitor his blood sugars and to
adjust his insulin and diuretic dose as needed.
FOLLOWUP: He was instructed to follow up with Dr. Edwardson in
1-3 weeks and to follow up with his outpatient
endocrinologist , Dr. Adelmund , in 1-2 weeks. Physical therapy was also
arranged for home physical therapy to begin after discharge.
