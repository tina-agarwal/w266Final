Discharge Date: 2/27/1997
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
PROCEDURES: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT X TWO , 25 of September . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was admitted to the
Cardiology Service on 23 of March for
work-up of unstable angina. She is a 72-year-old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors , admitted with unstable angina.
Cardiac risk factors include postmenopausal , age , hypertension ,
hyperlipidemia , and diabetes. She presented to the hospital with a
one week history of intermittent chest pain at rest. On 22 of April ,
she presented to E Hospital with postprandial
chest pain , no EKG changes , and she was admitted to the CCU to rule
out myocardial infarction. ETT on 17 of November was positive. The
patient was sent home with plan for outpatient MIBI scan and was
instructed to call the primary M.D. if she had recurrent chest
pain. She developed recurrent chest pain within 48 hours of
discharge but did not call her doctor. The pain resolved
spontaneously but recurred with rest or exertion. She was
readmitted to the Libay Ry Healthcare Health on 23 of March with
worsening chest pain. Her saturation was found to be 88% and she
had evidence of congestive heart failure. An EKG revealed ST
elevation in V1 , V2 , and inferior leads. The chest x-ray showed
moderate congestive heart failure. She was treated with IV TNG ,
Heparin , aspirin , Lopressor and the chest pain improved. EKG
changes normalized but persistence of concave ST segment elevation
in inferior leads. The patient was admitted for further
management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease; positive Persantine
thallium scan in 1994; insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; previous tobacco
smoker; glaucoma; cataract; nephrolithiasis; chronic renal
insufficiency with creatinine in the 2.0 range.
ALLERGIES: Lisinopril with cough.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Mevacor 40 milligrams once a day ,
Isordil 20 milligrams t.i.d. , Axid ,
Atenolol 50 milligrams once a day , NPH insulin 44 units in a.m.
with 22 units in p.m. , Cozaar 25 milligrams once a day , Dyazide 25
milligrams once a day , and eye drops.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , pulse 70-regular , blood pressure
130/80 , respiratory rate 20 , 100% on face
mask. No jaundice , no anemia , no cyanosis , no clubbing , no pedal
edema. The lungs were clear to auscultation. The heart was
regular with positive S4 , no murmurs. The abdomen was obese , soft ,
benign. No evidence of varicose veins , all peripheral pulses were
palpable. The neurological examination was intact.
LABORATORY DATA: The EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with ST
elevation in the inferior leads. The sodium was
144 , potassium 5.3 , chloride 109 , CO2 17 , BUN 51 , creatinine 2.4 ,
glucose 251 , WBC 13.7 , hematocrit 36.1 , and placement 253.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the ICU and was taken
to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on
24 of September and underwent cardiac catheterization. The pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 16. The patient had 99% obtuse
marginal one stenosis , 90% ramus stenosis , 80% mid-LAD artery
stenosis involving the diagonal 1 , which in addition had a 90%
lesion , an 80% distal LAD lesion at the apex. The patient was
taken to the Operating Room on 25 of September and underwent coronary
artery bypass graft x two with LIMA to LAD , saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal branch 1. Postoperatively , she was taken to the
ICU where she was extubated in postoperative day 1. However , her
respiratory status progressively worsening with increasing oxygen
requirement and she was reintubated on 23 of June .  Throughout this ,
she was aggressively diuresed and she was slowly weaned off the
ventilator. She had a bout of atrial fibrillation on postoperative
day 5 , which responded to Lopressor. Her hypertension was treated
initially with IV Hydralazine. In view of the extreme slow wean
off the ventilator , a Pulmonary consultation was obtained and on
their advise , diuresis was continued and she was weaned down to
pressor support and was fully extubated on postoperative day 7.
She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day 8 where she
continued to do well except for intermittent bouts of atrial
fibrillation. She has , however , remained in sinus rhythm for the
past 96 hours and she is being discharged in a stable condition on
postoperative day 13 , on 25 of October .
