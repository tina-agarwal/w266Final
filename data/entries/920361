HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year-old woman with
past hospitalizations for congestive
heart failure ( last March , 1996 ) and hypertension , who 3-4 weeks
prior to admission had been having increasing cough. Initially she
thought it was because of allergies , but it progressed and over the
3-4 days prior to admission she had increasing cough productive of
yellow sputum. Over the three days prior to admission the patient

recent leg swelling. She has no recent increase in frequency in
angina and no recent weight gain or increase in abdominal girth.
She describes increasing shortness of breath when lying on her left
side which is relieved by sleeping on her right side. Her most
recent echocardiogram in March of 1996 showed an ejection
fraction of 40% with 1 plus mitral regurgitation. She had a
Persantine MIBI in March of 1996 , on which she had no fixed or
reversible ischemia. The patient presented to the Mashard Medical Center in the emergency room on the day of admission and she was
afebrile.

FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died at age 82 from kidney failure. No

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her two grandchildren and
her daughter. She does not use tobacco and does
not drink alcohol. She is originally from Sco Oale Fran where the rest
of her family currently lives. She left there several months ago.
PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient was a pleasant woman lying comfortably
in bed in no apparent distress. Her temperature was 98.4 , pulse
106 , blood pressure 150/70 , respiratory rate 20 , saturation 95% on
room air. HEENT: Surgical right pupil , anicteric sclera , no nasal
discharge , moist oropharynx. Neck: Supple. No jugular venous
distention and no lymphadenopathy , full range of motion. Lungs:
Diffusely rigorous , no crackles or wheezes bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Distant heart sounds. S1 and S2 , no S3 and no S4 ,
no murmurs. Abdomen: Normal active bowel sounds. Soft ,
non-tender , non-distended and no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities:
No edema. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally. Neurological:
Mild decreased sensation left side of face , otherwise cranial
nerves III-XII are grossly intact. Reflexes in upper extremities
were 1 plus , no reflexes elicited in lower extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.3 , hematocrit 43 ,
platelet count 312. BUN 20 , creatinine 1.4 ,
glucose 377 , LDH 220. Sputum revealed 4+ polys , 4+ epithelial
cells , gram negative and gram positive cocci. Chest x-ray revealed
no evidence of congestive heart failure and no infiltrates.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 69 year-old woman with a history of
congestive heart failure and hypertension who
presented with a productive cough which was worsening over the past
3-4 days and fever to 101 with chills and shakes and increasing
shortness of breath. She was afebrile however at the time of
admission. Her exam was remarkable for diffuse rhonchi and
moderate jugular venous distention. She had a white blood cell
count of 9.3 with 54% polys and 9.6 % eosinophils. Blood glucose
of 377 and a chest x-ray without evidence of congestive heart
failure or infiltrate. She was treated in the emergency room with
Albuterol nebulizer and plans were to discharge her to home ,
however , her saturations dropped to 89% on room air with exercise
in the emergency room and was admitted for further observation.
She was started on intravenous Cefuroxime , and initially improved
with decrease in cough and shortness of breath however , the patient
continued to desat with exercise. A repeat chest x-ray was
performed which showed no change when compared to the admission
film. Her sputum culture grew out Pen-sensitive E-coli and she was
continued on her intravenous and then PO antibiotics. She
continued to desat with exercise , however , and her cough persisted
although she remained afebrile with a slightly elevated white count
and moderate peripheral eosinophilia. Her chest exam remained
rancorous and the reason for this remained unclear. Given the
finding of E-coli in the sputum sample , in addition to the elevated
eosinophilia and lack of finding on chest x-ray despite significant
findings on chest exam , the possibility of a worm or parasitic
disease was raised. The patient is from Pa but had not been
there in 8 years. She did have a history of diarrhea for several
weeks a few months prior to this admission. Stool specimen was
sent but was rejected by the laboratory and the patient was unable
to produce another stool specimen before discharge. The patient
was discharged to home with Albuterol inhaler and instructions to
follow up with her primary physician. In addition , plans were made
for her to have PFTs done as an outpatient and plan for chest CT if
her symptoms continued without other etiology being discovered.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po
q day. 2 ) Cefuroxime 500 mg PO b.i.d.
3 ) Premarin 0.625 mg PO q day. 4 ) Lasix 40 mg PO q day. 5 )
Tofranil 75 mg PO q HS. 6 ) Zestril 20 mg PO b.i.d. 7 ) Verapamil
SR 120 mg PO b.i.d. 8 ) Insulin 70/30 28 units q a.m. and 5 units
q p.m. subcue. 9 ) Potassium slow release 10 mEq PO q day. 10 )
Albuterol inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d.
DISPOSITION: At the time of discharge the patient's saturation was
92 to 93% on room air and dropping slightly to 90 to
91% with exercise , however she was tolerating this well and was
getting relief from her Albuterol inhaler. She was to finish a
full ten day course of antibiotics for presumed bronchitis and to
follow up with her primary physician in clinic for further
evaluation including PFTs and possible chest CT if symptoms did not
abate.
