Discharge Date: 3/16/1999
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1 ) ATRIAL FLUTTER. 2 ) LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Gerald Leonardo Vasguez is a 56-year-old man
with a history significant for a coronary artery bypass grafting
approximately one month ago with mitral valve annuloplasty ,
diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with a cough. The
patient had recently been evaluated on 5/30/99 for cough and was
treated for a pneumonia with levofloxacin.
The patient stated that his cough and malaise began approximately
one week after discharge postoperatively. He stated that his cough
was constant , worsened at night , with some small clear sputum.
Denied any hemoptysis or fevers. He also denied sick contacts. No
nausea and vomiting or diarrhea. The patient had also noted
increased leg swelling over the past several weeks. In addition
the patient was complaining of some orthopnea as well as PND.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting 4/10 ( left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , SVG to PDA , OM
[with mitral valve annuloplasty]. 2 ) Diabetes mellitus. 3 )
Hypertension.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Enteric coated aspirin , Zantac ,
Coumadin , Colace , Niferex , Vasotec and
NPH insulin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married , no alcohol , no smoking.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission. Temperature 97.9 , pulse 111 ,
blood pressure 133/86 , room air sat 96
percent. General - No acute distress. HEENT: Pupils equal , round
and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Jugular
venous distention 15 centimeters , no lymphadenopathy. Lungs
decreased breath sounds at base with bilaterally crackles on the
left a third of the way up. Cardiovascular - tachycardic , normal
S1S2. Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended. Extremities 3+ lower
extremity edema to the mid thigh. Venous stasis changes on the
shins. Neuro nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , creatinine 1.2 ,
glucose 103 , WBC 5.5 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets
37.6 , CK 113 , Troponin 1.03.
Chest x-ray - left-sided pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Alexander Chadwick Rucker was admitted for increasing
cough , left lower extremity edema for presumed
congestive heart failure exacerbation. Hospital course by systems:
1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient was noted to be in new onset
congestive heart failure. He was aggressively diuresed. It was
noted on admission that patient was in atrial flutter with pacing
at a rate of approximately 110-120. An electrophysiology consult
was obtained and pacer was interrogated and mode changed to DDI
from DDD. The patient was loaded on digoxin and subsequently
spontaneously reverted to normal sinus rhythm.
2 ) Pulmonary. The patient was noted to have a persistent pleural
effusion that was new since the patient's coronary artery bypass
graft one month previous. Although it was suspected that this was
likely secondary to congestive heart failure or perhaps
postoperative pleural effusion , etiology was unclear. A pulmonary
consult was obtained. The patient did undergo a
diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis of 500 cc of fluid. Analysis
of the fluid showed a pH of 7.48 , total protein of 4.8 ( serum total
protein 7.6 ) , LDH of 158 ( serum LDH 228 ) ,
glucose 135 , amylase 33 with 600 white blood cells , 6 polys , 0
bands , 56 lymphs , 13 monos , 18 macrophages and 7 , 000 red blood
cells. No PMNs were noted. Cytology was still pending at the time
of discharge. Though the pleural effusion did meet criteria for an
exudate , this was difficult to interpret in light of the patient's
recent aggressive diuresis. As fluid did not appear to be
inspected. A PPD with control was planted which was negative ,
however controls were also anergic. Sputum cultures were negative.
It was felt that the patient would likely benefit from repeat
thoracentesis to remove enough fluid so that subsequently chest CT
could be performed. This was to be pursued as an outpatient.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on 10/30/99 with a home
VNA and physical therapy services for vital signs
monitoring and post coronary artery bypass graft rehab services.
FOLLOWUP: The patient was to follow up with Dr. Ladika on 11/11/99
in the chest diseases clinic , as well as with Dr.
Thayne , his outpatient cardiologist. He was also to be seen in
Coumadin clinic.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d.; digoxin
0.125 mg q.d.; Lasix 80 mg q.d.; NPH
insulin 20 units q. a.m. , 10 units q. p.m.; Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.;
Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.; Coumadin 7.5 mg q.
h.s.; Zocor 40 mg q. h.s.; Niferex 150 mg b.i.d.
