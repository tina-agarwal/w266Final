ATTENDING: UHAS , FRANKLYN M.D.
SERVICE:
General Medicine Ent Ster Villepeakechatdar
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Hematemesis.
PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED DURING THE HOSPITALIZATION:
Hematemesis , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; uncontrolled ,
hypertension , congestive heart failure , acute renal failure due
to NSAID abuse , hypothyroidism , paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia with rapid ventricular response , gastroesophageal
disease , hiatal hernia , and Barrett's esophagitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 75-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes
mellitus , insulin dependent , as well as a history of CHF and
supraventricular tachycardia in addition to a history of
gastroesophageal reflux disease , hiatal hernia and esophageal
stricture status post three dilations in the remote past. She
was recently discharged from the Tohall Villeviewtrom Moralb Medical Center on
10/23/05 after admission for UTI and acute renal failure in the
setting of NSAID abuse because of low back pain. She was
discharged to the nursing home on that day and experienced mild
nausea and emesis that evening. Her symptoms progressed over the
night and continued throughout the next day , and she presented
with complaints of coffee-ground emesis without melena ,
dizziness , orthostasis , or palpitations. She has no abdominal
pain , diarrhea , or constipation. She did have a history of sick
contact , her previous roommate , during the hospitalization had
gastroenteritis. Therefore , on 4/24/05 , she was transferred
from the nursing home to the Baview Hospital And Medical Center for
evaluation of the hematemesis.
PERTINENT REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She denied any symptoms of orthostasis. She denied any visual
complaints , dizziness , or imbalance. She had no incontinence ,
dysuria , frequency , or urgency. She had no chest pain and no
shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
NPH subcutaneously 35 units q.a.m. , NPH subcutaneously 10 units
q.p.m. , NovoLog sliding scale , Reglan 5 mg by mouth twice a day ,
Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice a day for 14 days and then once
daily , Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day , Tylenol 1000
mg by mouth three times a day , Atrovent nebulizer 0.5 mg inhaled
as needed , Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily , Lipitor 10 mg by mouth
daily , PhosLo 667 mg by mouth before meals , Synthroid 200 mcg by
mouth daily , miconazole nitrate 2% cream twice a day application ,
Actonel 35 mg by mouth once a week , on Sunday , Detrol LA 4 mg by
mouth daily , nifedipine XL , and Neurontin 300 mg by mouth daily.
ALLERGIES:
Include albuterol , which causes supraventricular tachycardia ,
penicillin causes rash , ibuprofen , which causes acute renal
failure , and sulfa drugs , which cause an unknown reaction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission , the physical exam was notable for temperature 96.2 ,
heart rate 87 , blood pressure 146/90 , respiratory rate 20 , and O2
sat on room air is 93%. Her general physical examination showed
no icterus and no conjunctivae pallor. Pulmonary exam was
benign. Cardiovascular exam showed regular rate and rhythm , S1 ,
S2 , occasional pauses , but good peripheral pulses. Abdominal
exam showed an obese abdomen , normoactive bowel sounds , soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. The exam of the extremities showed
pitting edema to the knee , otherwise was nontender and she has
good muscle strength throughout. The neurological exam was
nonfocal. The vomitus was examined and it was shown to be
gastroccult negative.
LABORATORY DATA:
Pertinent laboratory findings showed sodium of 140 , chloride of
102 , bicarbonate of 19 , creatinine of 2.6 , down from max of over
6 , anion gap 19 , glucose on chemistry 351 , normal liver test ,
hematocrit of 36.8 within her normal range , and normal coags.
OPERATIONS OR PROCEDURES PERFORMED NOT IN OR:
She had an upper GI series on 1/4/05 , a video swallow on
11/22/05 , and upper endoscopy on 4/21/05 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE:
In summary , in terms of the hematemesis from the GI standpoint ,
there was no blood shown in the emesis during the
hospitalization. Her symptoms were treated with Reglan ,
initially IV than p.o. The differential diagnosis on admission
was gastroenteritis due to sick contacts , gastritis secondary to
pervious history of NSAID use , ulcer , recurrent esophageal
stricture , other enteritis or DKA given elevated glucose levels
and anion gap on admission. Other things considered were
atypical cardiac ischemia. In order to evaluate the cause of the
hematemesis , she underwent the barium swallow on 1/4/05 . 
Unfortunately , this test was canceled prematurely due to evidence
of aspiration on the initial swallow. She was kept n.p.o. from
7/6/05 to 07 until video swallow could be performed ,
which showed minimal aspiration with swallowing , but was
improved with chin tuck maneuver. An initial diet of mechanical
soft with liquids was recommended with advancement as necessary.
GI was consulted , Dr. Costine attending , and upper endoscopy
was performed on 4/21/05 , which showed nonerosive esophagitis
and a hiatal hernia , both known by history , otherwise , there was
no ulcerations and no stricture. The emesis subsided during the
hospitalization. She was continued on Nexium while in-house as
well as Reglan p.r.n. and tolerated regular house feeds prior to
discharge with no emesis. As an aside , she developed diarrhea
while in-house. Given history of pervious antibiotic use for
UTI , C. diff cultures were sent , both are pending at this time.
The suspicion is low. She is being treated with Imodium p.r.n.
In terms of her history of acute renal failure , the creatinine
had continued to decrease through her hospitalization , but after
aggressive diuresis , she had slight increase in her creatinine ,
but this responded well to reducing the rate of Lasix and mild
hydration. From a cardiovascular standpoint , her hospital stay
was complicated by two distinct episodes of supraventricular
tachycardia with rapid ventricular response , one on 10/11/05 and
one on 9/29/05 .  The event on 10/11/05 occurred at 5:00 p.m.
with heart rates in 200 range. She was treated with Lopressor 5
mg followed by diltiazem 20 mg x2 , which then caused reduction in
the heart rate to the 90s. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. was then
added to her regimen. On 9/29/05 , at 2:00 a.m. , she had heart
rate to the 160s , again was treated with diltiazem 20 mg IV x1
and her heart rate decreased to the 90s. At that time , her
diltiazem dose was increased to 90 mg q.i.d. From an infectious
disease standpoint , there were no obvious infections diagnosed
during this stay , but the results of stool cultures are pending.
Her pulmonary status remained stable with good O2 saturation on
room air throughout the hospitalization. From an endocrine
standpoint , her diabetes was moderately controlled during her
hospitalization. She was switched from her standing NPH to
regular insulin sliding scale while n.p.o. because of low blood
sugars. After initiating p.o. intake , her sugars were initially
uncontrolled and aggressively managed with Regular Insulin
sliding scale in addition to an NPH standing regimen. Upon
discharge , Ms. Azen was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , range
68-93 , normotensive with the blood pressure of 120/50 with good
O2 saturation on room air of 93%. Her cardiac and pulmonary
exams were benign. Abdomen exam was also benign , but symptoms of
loose bowel movements were still notable without abdominal pain.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. for pain , headache , or
temperature , diltiazem 90 mg p.o. four times a day , Lasix 40 mg
by mouth daily , NPH 10 units subcutaneously nightly , NPH 40 units
subcutaneously q.a.m. , Atrovent inhaler two puffs inhaled four
times a day , Synthroid 200 mcg p.o. daily , Imodium 2 mg p.o.
q.6h. , Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily , Reglan 10 mg by mouth four
times a day as needed for nausea , Lipitor 10 mg by mouth daily ,
Protonix 40 mg by mouth daily , KCl slow release 20 mEq by mouth
