Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure on the right arm
108/59 , and oxygen saturation 98%. HEENT , PERRLA , dentition
without evidence of infection , no carotid bruits. On chest
examination , no incisions. Cardiovascular , regular rate and
rhythm without murmurs. Respiratory , breath sounds are clear
bilaterally. On abdominal exam , bilateral inguinal hernia
incisions and enlarged right groin hematoma from previous cardiac
catheterization. On extremities , bilateral lower extremity
varicosities. Neuro exam , the patient was alert and oriented
without focal deficits.
Cardiac catheterization performed at An
on 10/28/06 revealed 30% mid RCA occlusion , 40% distal RCA , 90%
ostial OM1 , 90% mid CX , 80% proximal LAD , 99% mid LAD , and 60%
mid LM. EKG on 2/5/06 showed a normal sinus rhythm at 76 and
an incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest x-ray on
10/28/06 was consistent with congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course is as follows by
systems.
1. Neurologic: Agitation and delirium. In the immediate
postoperative period , the patient was on alcohol drip , given a
preop history of alcohol use. The patient's neurologic status
improved with the patient being more alert during the day ,
particularly with family members present. Haldol was used p.r.n.
for agitation during the hospital course.
2. Cardiovascular: On 11/5/06 , the patient was taken to the
operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x1
with LIMA to LAD , with incomplete revascularization due to
inadequate conduit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and
after a period of observation , was transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Intensive Care Unit. Subsequently , during the hospital
stay , the patient was started on beta-blockers and statins.
Later during the hospital stay , the patient became hypotensive , requiring
fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration.
3. Respiratory: The patient was extubated on postoperative day
two , but he was reintubated for acute respiratory failure later during the day
with subsequent re-extubation on 1/14/07 . During the hospital stay ,
the patient had two additional re-intubations for acute respiratory failure
events , one on 0/7/07 followed by extubation on the next day , on 0/14/07 and
the second one on 9/26/07 followed by extubation on 6/24/07 .
4. GI: It was characterized by nutrition deficiency , although
the patient was able to tolerate soft mechanical diet , the intake
was limited. The puff tubes were placed multiple times for
additional nutrition , but were frequently removed by the patient ,
given the delirium and agitation.
5. Renal: The patient had good urine output and the electrolyte
and creatinine levels were closely monitored.
6. Endocrine: Tight glycemic control was maintained with
Portland protocol in the immediate postop period and subsequently
with subcu insulin. The patient was also on prednisone with the
preop indications for COPD and given his postop frequent
bronchospastic events.
7. Hematologic: The patient was started on aspirin and also on
Plavix , given the incomplete coronary vascularization.
Hematocrit and platelets were stable.
8. Infectious disease: The course was complicated by: A )
Sternal wound infection for which the patient underwent
pericardial strip advancement on 0/7/07 and omental flap and
wound closure on 10/13/07 . The wound was reopened at the bedside
on 10/30/07 by Plastic Surgery due to increased drainage and a
VAC sponge was placed. Wound cultures were sent and appropriate
antibiotic treatment was instituted. B ) Pneumonias. Treated
initially empirically and subsequently with specific antibiotics
after culture results became available. C ) Fever , later in the
hospital course , the patient experienced fever without
leukocytosis despite negative cultures. Throughout the hospital
course , Infectious Disease Service and Pulmonary Service were
consulted and they followed the patient continuously.
9. Other: Incidental radiologic finding of a renal mass
consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Urology Service was
consulted and the recommendations were made for no intervention
at this time.
After excessive discussion with the very supportive patient's family with

medical care and discharge the patient to home with hospice services. Thus , on
