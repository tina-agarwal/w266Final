ATTENDING: KRIEGE , DERRICK M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right thigh burn , cellulitis and diabetic
ketoacidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Hesby is a 36-year-old woman
with very poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and extensive end
organ damage including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
right eye blindness , lower extremity neuropathy , gastroparesis
and a history of extensive infections including VRE line sepsis ,
MRSA , abdominal abscesses and chronic dermal ulcers. Due to her
dermal ulcers , she developed left ankle osteomyelitis requiring
below-the-knee amputation. She was transferred from Shiredo Sert Of Valley on 3/28/06 in DKA in the setting of a right thigh burn
and possible infection.
The patient was in her usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when she spilled hot broth on her right thigh
and developed a painful red bullae. She presented to Path Community Hospital two days prior to admission , but still she had an
infection. She was given a prescription for antibiotics , which
she did not fill. The area of swelling in her right leg did not
spread from the original blister area all the way up to her groin
and grossly became more tender and warm. On the day of
admission , she returned to the Threei Cent Hospital Emergency Room
for evaluation. Of note , in going to the emergency room , she
missed her regular hemodialysis. In the Ingsparks Down Health
Emergency room , the following vital signs were noted.
Temperature afebrile , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 150/50 ,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air. WBC 4.3 , hematocrit 38 ,
sodium 126 , potassium 7.9 , glucose 1221 , anion gap 13 , acetone
negative , AST 385 , ALT 127 and alk phos 411. EKG revealed peak Q
waves. The patient was given 20 units of IV insulin and then was
started on an insulin drip 8 units per hour. She also received 2
amps of calcium gluconate as well as Kayexalate and albuterol
nebs. A repeat Chem-7 in the Amoore Medical Center ED showed a glucose of
1100 and an anion gap of 18 with potassium 5.4. The patient was
transferred to the MICU at EH for further management. At the
time of her transfer , she noted left-sided headache , a warm
feeling over her right thigh. She denied any recent fever ,
shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or
diarrhea. She did note that her last bowel movement was three
days prior to admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. DKA: The patient was stabilized in the MICU on an insulin
drip and was then transferred to General Medicine for further
management. Causes of DKA that were ruled out included the
following - negative cardiac enzymes , unimpressive pancreatic
enzymes , unimpressive lactate , normal LFTs. The patient's DKA
was presumed to be due to her right thigh cellulitis in the
setting of a local burn. She initially was given 500 mL normal
saline boluses and then several 250 mL boluses. As she is
aneuric , her boluses were stopped once the blood sugars were
below 500. She initially was placed on insulin drip that was
then transitioned to NPH and finally to Lantus 24 units subcu
daily. Of note , the patient intermittently refused to take both
her long-acting and her insulin sliding scale. As a result , an
endocrinology consult was called. The patient was noted to be
ordering extra food from the kitchen , which could in part explain
her labile sugars. Despite careful diet and glucose control
efforts , the patient still had sugars at times to the 500s.
Endocrinology continues to leave recommendations about AC
standing insulin in addition to her NovoLog sliding scale and
Lantus insulin. The patient has a history of gastroparesis and
therefore may not tolerate AC insulin very well. The patient's
new covering team will continue to follow up with Endocrinology.
2. Right thigh cellulitis: The patient was placed on Augmentin
and IV vancomycin. Her area of cellulitis has completely
resolved at the present time with slight sloughing of the
overlying skin. The underlying skin is pink with evidence of
good granulation and no further evidence of infection. Given
that her IV access is very difficult , the patient received some
vancomycin , as she finishes hemodialysis every other day.
3. End-stage renal disease: The patient missed her dialysis on
the day of admission. Once in the hospital , her potassium was
very difficult to control in part due to poor adherence with her
renal diet and in part due to her very labile sugars. At times ,
her potassium would rapidly increase to a level higher than 6.5
requiring urgent dialysis. At the present time , the patient has
been dialyzed daily since her admission. She is closely followed
by renal with plans to continue dialysis while in the hospital.
She should not receive any further intravenous fluids unless she
has evidence of recurrent DKA , given her anuric state. Should
she become acidotic , the patient can be managed with sodium
bicarbonate and D5W in small boluses.
4. Cardiovascular: Ischemia , there was no evidence of chest
pain. The patient has showed no EKG signs of ischemia. Her
cardiac enzymes remained negative. Lipids are pending at the
present time. Lipid profile check is pending at the present
time. Pump , the patient has a history of CHF with evidence of
right heart failure likely due to valvular disease in some aspect
of the diastolic dysfunction given her preserved ejection
fraction. Her weight on admission was 70 kg. We did not know
her dry weight. Dialysis is helping to manage her fluids given
her aneuric status. Her O2 sats remained stable on room air
throughout the hospitalization. Her hypertension has been
somewhat poorly controlled and for that reason she was continued
on her home dose of Lopressor 25 q.i.d. and switched to
Captopril , which we continued to titrate at the present time.
Rhythm , normal sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on
telemetry with no signs of arrhythmia.
5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: The patient was placed on a
cardiac , renal and diabetic diet. She was noted to repeatedly
order extra food from the kitchen supervisor. Nutrition
endocrinology and nursing staff are all aware and are working
diligently to prevent the patient from receiving more than 2000
calories per day as specified by her ADA diet. She is continuing
her Nephrocaps and sevelamer. Prophylaxis , heparin 5000 units
subcu t.i.d. - the patient has consistently refused her heparin.
6. Consent: All interventions require consent from the
patient's medical guardian , Stanley Paneque ( please see number
above ).
7. Code status: The patient is full code and this has been
confirmed with the guardian.
ADDENDUM
Of note , on the night of 1/26/06 , the patient complained of
severe cramping , right lower quadrant pain , which is new. She
noted this pain has increased rapidly in the setting of diarrhea.
Several C. diff studies , which were sent recently have been
negative and the patient has had no blood in her diarrhea.
Presumed cause is Augmentin , which has been stopped. The patient
has continued to eat freely and is passing diarrhea despite her
complaints of 10/10 severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of her
abdomen was ordered , but she refused to take oral or IV contrast.
The results of this CT scan are pending and will be followed up
by the new medical team.
