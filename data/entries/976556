DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCT.
CONTRIBUTING DIAGNOSIS: HYPERTENSION , CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ,
DIABETES , SCHIZOPHRENIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old black
female with a history of diabetes ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease , SVT and schizophrenia
presented with 45 minutes of substernal burning , shortness of
breath and diaphoresis. The patient has a long history of chest
pain which began in 1988 with her first rule out for MI. She has
had extensive cardiac workup including a recent ETT MIBI during
which she went 5 minutes 40 seconds with a maximum heart rate of
71 , blood pressure of 138/68 with no ST segment changes and no
evidence for ischemia. MIBI images: anteroapical defect on stress
images with reperfusion at rest consistent with ischemia. These
studies were done in March of 1992. The patient was thought to have
rate related ischemia which is induced by SVTs or other
precipitants that increase her heart rate. The patient has had no
substernal chest pressures since March of 1992. She experiences no
chest discomfort on exertion. She has had a good rate control on
Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient presented in the Emergency
Room today complaining of epigastric burning in her chest 1 time a
week which awakened her from sleep at night. It is usually relieved
by Mylanta. On the day of admission , however , the patient
experienced a sudden onset of substernal chest burning without
radiation while lying in bed. She had eaten 1 hour before going to
bed. The pain was accompanied by palpitations , shortness of breath
and diaphoresis. She denied nausea and vomiting. It was not
relieved by Mylanta. The patient received a sublingual
nitroglycerin in the ambulance resulting in relief. The patient's
cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes , history of
tobacco use and hypercholesterolemia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As
above: Adult onset diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a left great
toe ingrown toe nail , diverticulosis , history of frequent nose
bleed , multiple right pinna ear infection , schizophrenia , history
of colonic polyps with guaiac positive stools in 1987 and a barium
enema the same year demonstrating colonic diverticula , degenerative
joint disease of the knees. MEDICATIONS: Medications on admission:
Verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d , Naprosyn 375mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. ,
fluphenazine 35cc IM q 2 weeks , Ibuprofen 400mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Nitropatch , Lopressor 75mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 45 units
q.a.m. , Pepcid 20mg b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 1 tablet p.o. q
d , Librium 10mg p.o. b.i.d. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known
drug allergies. Family history includes a brother who died at 60 of
an MI , a sister who died at 71 of an MI. Social History: The
patient is a widow with 4 children , lives with grandson , a retired
factory seamstress who stopped smoking 25 years ago. She had smoked
a 1/2 pack a day for 5 years and has no history of ethanol usage.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a pleasant black female in no
apparent distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
pulse of 100 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations at 16. HEENT:
Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light. Oropharynx was clear.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits. Lungs
were clear to auscultation. Heart: Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with distant heart sounds and normal S1 , S2. Abdomen:
Abdomen was with normal bowel sounds , was soft , obese and
non-tender with a hyperpigmented patch centrally. EXTREMITIES:
Extremities are without edema or joint effusions. The left great
toe had hypertrophic toe nails , tender to palpation with an ingrown
toenail. Rectal was with guaiac positive stool. NEURO: Neuro exam
was grossly non-focal. Skin had no new rashes.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Admission data included a sodium of 144 ,
a potassium of 4 , chloride of 107 , bicarb
of 27 , BUN of 24 , creatinine of 1.1 , glucose of 155. CK was 430
with an MB fraction of 1.5 and as an aside , the patient is known to
have chronically elevated CKs. White count was 8.7 , hematocrit of
36 with an MCV of 90 and 93 , 000 platelets. PT 13 , PTT 30. LFTs
were within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at
95 beats per minute with intervals of .18 , .81 , .35 and axis of 21
with Q waves in V1 , V2 , T wave flattening in V2. Chest x-ray was
without infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course by system: The patient was ruled
out for MI , had CKs of 430 with an MB fraction of
1.544 with an MB fraction of 1.9 and 404 with an MB fraction of .8.
There were no further EKG changes. The patient had no chest pain
while in the hospital. The patient's Lopressor was increased to
75mg q.i.d. while in house and the patient also underwent a
diagnostic cardiac catheterization with the following results: An
LAD without critical stenosis , an OMB1 with a 90% proximal stenosis
and OMB2 with diffuse disease and serial lesions , an RCA with a
proximal 90% stenosis and a distal 70% stenosis , and normal
ventricular function. The patient was offered PTCA of her critical
lesions and the patient declined. As the patient had not been
compliant with her medical regimen , it was felt that we would send
her out on her increased dosage of Lopressor and monitor her level
of chest discomfort and perhaps re-offer her PTCA at a later date.
The patient's toe was evaluated by podiatry who felt that she had ,
in fact , an ingrown toenail which was treated via avulsion of the
margin of the nail and a 4 day course of Cephradine 500mg p.o.
q.i.d. The patient had all Ansaid held secondary to her guaiac
positive stool and her hematocrit monitored and it suggested that
the patient have a GI workup as an outpatient. The patient had
anemia which was thought secondary to chronic GI bleed. Iron
studies performed while in house detected an iron level of 31 ,
total iron binding capacity of 246 , a B12 of 904 , folate of 10.4 ,
and a ferritin of 235; all not consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. The patient also presented with thrombocytopenia which was
thought perhaps secondary to Pepcid or Ansaid. These medications
were held while she was in house and her platelet level remained
approximately 100 and was so upon discharge.
DISPOSITION: The patient continued her normal medical regimen for
schizophrenia and was discharged in stable condition
on the following medicines: MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin
325mg a day , Librium 10mg b.i.d. , NPH insulin 42 units sub q
q.a.m. , Lopressor 100mg p.o. t.i.d. , verapamil SR 240mg p.o. q d ,
Prolixin Decanoate 12.5mg IM q o weekly and nitroglycerin 1/150 1
tablet sublingual q 5 minutes x 3 p.r.n. chest pain. The patient
will have home health aid and VNA services to ensure more
compliance with medication regimen and diet , also to check finger
stick glucose every day , blood pressure every week and to
administer her Prolixin every week. The patient is recommended to
be on a 800 ADA diet and will have follow-up with Dr.
in the CO Clinic.
