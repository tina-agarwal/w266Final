ATTENDING: WILCH , JOHNSON M.D.
SERVICE:
Cardiac Surgery Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Symptomatic critical aortic stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 56-year-old smoker status post renal transplant in March
of this year complicated by delayed graft function and sepsis who
presented two days prior to admission with shortness of breath
and chest pain. The patient was found to have critical aortic
stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm2 an EF of 60%. The patient
does have a history of positive stress test for which a cardiac
catheterization was performed in 5/13 .  At that time , he was
found to have 40% lesion of the LAD. On admission to the
Nides Medical Center , on 6/4/05 , cardiac enzymes were drawn and this showed
a troponin level of 0.21. EKG showed no acute changes. The
patient was placed ACS protocol and initially admitted to the
Cardiology Service. The Cardiac Surgery Service was consulted
for emergent aortic valve repair and potential coronary artery
bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. End-stage renal disease secondary to hypertension , status
post cadaveric renal transplant in 9/27 complicated by delayed
graft function and sepsis , baseline creatinine 2.2-2.4.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Status post right upper extremity AV fistula.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. daily.
2. Prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily.
3. FK506 , dose according to level.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
A 40-pack-year cigarette history. The patient is a painter and
is still working.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Father on dialysis , mother with hypertension , and sister is with
diabetes mellitus.

Height 6 foot 1 inch and weight 100 kg. Temperature 98.0
degrees , heart rate 82 and sinus , blood pressure right arm
126/60 , blood pressure left arm 130/68 , and oxygen saturation
97%. No carotid bruits , regular rate and rhythm with a loud 4-6
systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border , bilateral
rales. Soft , nontender , and nondistended abdomen. Extremities
with 2+ edema bilaterally. Pulses , 2+ femoral bilaterally.
Pedal pulses are present by Doppler bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:
Admission labs are significant for BUN of 49 , creatinine of 2.8 ,
glucose of 203 , white blood cell count of 9660 , hematocrit of
35% , and platelets 269 , 000.
IMAGING:
1. Cardiac catheterization on 2/6/04 performed at Sonprat Health , 40%
proximal LAD lesion , codominant circulation.
2. Echocardiogram on 9/27 , aortic stenosis with mean gradient
62 mmHg , peak gradient of 82 mmHg , calculated valve area 0.7 cm2 ,
mild aortic insufficiency , trivial mitral insufficiency , LVH EF
of 50%.
3. EKG on 6/17/05 , normal sinus rhythm at 70 with first-degree
AV block , evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
4. Chest x-ray on 6/17/05 , interstitial pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
On 9/29/05 , the patient was brought to the operating room for
critical aortic stenosis , acute coronary syndrome and acute
pulmonary edema. He underwent an aortic valve replacement with a
#21 Carpentier-Edwards magna valve , as well as a coronary artery
bypass graft x1 with LIMA to LAD. Bypass time was 120 minutes
and crossclamp time 90 minutes. Two atrial wires and one
ventricular wire was placed. Please see the operative note for
further details. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He
was extubated with without incident on postoperative day #1. His
neurologic status was in time and he did not suffer any delirium
as witnessed after his initial emergence from anesthesia during
the renal transplantation. He was noted to have significant oral
secretions , but these were clear and thin. On postoperative day
#1 , his femoral arterial line was removed and his renal
transplantation medications restarted. His CK-MB peaked at 46
and did trend down thereafter. On postoperative day #2 , he had
begun to be diuresed in light persistent pulmonary edema and seen
by chest x-ray. His chest tubes were removed without incident.
On postoperative day #3 , he was hemodynamically stable. His FK
levels were noted to be low , as is historically the case with
him. Renal Transplant Medicine was following and did titrated
his medications as necessary. On postoperative day #4 , his final
left chest tube was removed. Post-pull chest x-ray showed the
lung to be well expanded. He was found to be hyponatremic with a
sodium of approximately 130. He was begun on fluid restriction
of 1.5 liters for hematocrit of 21. A 1 unit of packed red blood
cells was also given at this time and he was continued on
diuresis. On postoperative day #5 , as his preoperatively weight
had been reached , he was taken off of diuresis. His renal
transplantation medications discontinue. The patient was up out
of bed and ambulating well. The patient was also noted to have a
large sacral decubitus ulcer , without exposure of bone. This
ulcer was the result of the previous admission in March after
renal transplantation. The Plastic Surgery Service was consulted
and their recommendations included appropriate therapeutic
support surface , frequent turning with minimization of being in
the seated position , optimization of nutrition , and wet-to-dry
dressings to the wound. The service is still following the
patient and will consider VAC dressing and the later time.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEMS:

narcotic pain medications as tolerated. Please avoid NSAIDs and
nephrotoxic drugs for pain control.
Cardiovascular: Lopressor increased to 37.5 mg p.o. q.i.d.. To
be titrated to goal systolic blood pressure of less than 140 and
heart rate in the 70's. Diltiazem , currently on hold , per Dr.
Grat . Renal Transplant Medicine is aware and in an agreement.
Respiratory: The patient is saturating well on room air. Chest
x-ray with mild pulmonary edema , improving each day. Continue
pulmonary toilet and activity.

the time of transfer. Sodium level to be followed.
Endocrine: The patient on NovoLog sliding scale Diabetes
Management Service following.
Heme: The patient transfused on 4/23/05 for a hematocrit of 21.
