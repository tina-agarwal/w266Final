Discharge Date: 10/13/1995
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS
SURGERY IN 1988.
2 ) ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE SINCE 1983.
3 ) INFERIOR WALL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man with
a history of ischemic heart disease
since 1983. He had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction at this time
and in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and a
subsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. In 1991 , he
sustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantine
thallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. He was
well maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until July 1992.
At this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstable
angina. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time.
An echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.
Persantine thallium in July 1995 demonstrated posterobasilar
defect with 60% redistribution. After this episode , he had again
been symptom free. On 1/8/95 , the patient began experiencing
substernal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left arm
with good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episode
time of five minutes. On 4/5/95 , he had a similar episode for
approximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. On the day of
admission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode of
substernal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea.
EKG was significant only for non-specific low T waves. Patient was
heparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin and
nitrates. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and the
plan was to do a persantine thallium. The patient continued to
have pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the Caus Memorial Hospital for further evaluation and cardiac
catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above as well as significant for polio
with subsequent muscle weakness of the left
hip and leg.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: On admission were notable for Lopressor 50 mg
q.6h. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , and
Heparin 1300 units per hour.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission were notable for a
blood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heart
rate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was no
jugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs were
clear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point of
maximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm ,
normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. Abdomen was
soft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly ,
extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit
of 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassium
of 3.7 , PT and PTT of 12.7 and 55 with an INR of 1.1 , and
cholesterol was noted to be 287.
HOSPITAL COURSE: While here , Mr. Mollema had one episode of 10/10
substernal chest pressure not associated with
diaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin. EKG with pain as compared to old EKG demonstrated
inversion of T waves in V1 through V3 and questionable inversions
in III and F. These inversions were present on a 2/29/95 EKG but
not on a 6/21/95 EKG. The EKG changes with the past medical
history was most likely significant of ongoing instability of the
patient's anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. At this
time , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. This is a 57 year
old male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in the
past status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988
admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest.
Aspirin , Heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued.
Cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vessel
disease but the bypass grafts , the LIMA to the left anterior
descending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximal
descending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramus
was occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graft
to the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to the
patient's pain and EKG changes. The patient was continued on
Heparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemed
appropriate to PTCA the ramus lesion. The patient was taken to the
Catheterization Laboratory on 0/3/95 for successful PTCA of the
ramus occlusion. Post-procedure , the patient was stable and chest
pain free. Post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with a
blood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. The right femoral
catheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulses
were 2+. Dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and there
was no cyanosis. The patient was enrolled on the AMH protocol as
per Dr. Androsky and as such , received 36 hours of intravenous
protocol therapy post-catheterization. The right groin sheaths
were removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 ,
and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint of
chest pain. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital
day. Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of
130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 ,
O2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normal
limits. Cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensity
non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , or
rubs.
DISPOSITION: The patient is stable upon discharge and symptom
free.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. and
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient is to follow-up with Dr. Quincy Noble Aldo Zeyadeh at
Vere Hospital
