A/P: 80 y/o F h/o DVT on coumadin , non-small cell ca s/p resection on
tarceva , morbid obesity presents with persistent nosebleeds.
1. Epistaxis - s/p cauterization by ENT with no recurrence. Off
coumadin s/p 3U FFP with INR 1.8. Will hold off on coumadin for now
and allow for nose bleed to fully heal. PCP contacted and after
communication with the pt's oncologist the plan is to stop tarceva for
now until she sees her oncologist. She will also be off coumadin and
start on Arixtra 2.5mg SC daily.
2. h/o DVT- appears to have been on coumadin as far back as 1993 with a
documented h/o L superficial femoral vein DVT. She has multiple risk
factors for DVT inclding morbid obesity , malignancy and prior h/o DVT
she will require continuation of anticoagulation. Pt's oncologist Dr.
Reges aware and recommends stopping coumadin and starting arixtra.
3. Heme - transfused 2U PRBCS on admission and no further evidence of
bleeding. Hct stable at 26%. She was transfused an additional 1UPRBC
before d/c.
