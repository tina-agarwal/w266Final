Discharge Date: 5/26/2002
SERVICE: The patient was taken care of on the Cardiology Min Wahayownvi
Service.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old man with
hypertension , hypercholesterol ,
diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft , PTCA , with known exertional angina , who now
presents with episodes of chest pressure , shortness of breath
lasting approximately one hour and occurring at rest. The patient
was taken to an outside hospital where his pain dissipated only
after sublingual nitroglycerin , then IV nitroglycerin , Lopressor ,
Plavix , enoxaparin , and aspirin. At the outside hospital , the CK
was found to be 400 with an MB fraction of 4 percent. A Troponin T
was found to be 0.099 , creatinine was 2.2. Upon arrival to the
Noirxas* Community Hospital , the patient had 1/10 chest pain and a blood pressure of
195/98 which improved with TNG to 170 systolic and after after
Lopressor to 130 systolic.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease status post MI in
1994 and 1995 , status post CABG seven years
ago , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Zestril 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 80 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lasix 40 mg q.d. , insulin 70/30 40 mg b.i.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was a former smoker who quit 40 years
ago but has an 80 pack year history. He drinks
alcohol occasionally. He lives with his wife in Endnai Boulevard , Dumonte , Oregon 38055 ,
West Virginia
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is negative for coronary artery
disease , however , he does have a family history of
diabetes mellitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signs were a
temperature of 96.3 , heart rate 80 , blood
pressure 195/95 , respiratory rate 18 , O2 sats 100 percent on 3
liters of oxygen. General , the patient appeared comfortable , in no
apparent distress. HEENT , the pupils are equal , round , reactive to
light , extraocular movements are intact , mucous membranes are
moist. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally , crackles
in the lower half of the lung fields bilaterally , no wheezes.
Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 normal , no S3 or
S4 , positive 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen is soft ,
nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds. Extremities , no
clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , 2+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
Neurological exam , nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent labs at the time of admission , the
patient has a creatinine of 2.2 up slightly from
a baseline of 1.8. He had a hematocrit of 36.8. CK equal to 417 ,
MB equal to 15 , Troponin T equal to 0.09. EKG showed normal sinus
rhythm , first-degree AV block , left axis deviation , T wave
inversion in aVL , and T wave flattening in lead 1.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: Cardiovascular: The patient was
started on aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor ,
Zocor , heparin , and a 2B3A inhibitor before cardiac
catheterization. Zestril was held secondary to marginal renal
function. Cardiac catheterization on July revealed occlusion
of SVG to RCA and SVG to OM. These lesions were treated with a
total of five stents. The last OM manipulation resulted in
showering of plaque and subsequent chest pain and EKG changes ( ST
elevation in precordial leads ). Following cardiac catheterization
the patient had no further episodes of chest pain and remained
hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course. He was
successfully diuresed following his acute renal failure.
Renal/GU: The patient has a baseline chronic renal insufficiency
with a creatinine of 1.8. Following cardiac catheterization the
patient developed acute renal failure secondary to IV contrast with
a creatinine peaking at 6.8 , and then improving gradually to 4.2
upon discharge. While in the hospital the patient was followed by
Renal and Urology consult team. The patient had developed
hematuria while on aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and 2B3A inhibitor.
His hematuria resolved gradually. A renal ultrasound demonstrated
no evidence of obstruction , but did show several simple cysts , as
well as a calcified cyst which was further evaluated by CT scan ,
which demonstrated a likely hyperdense cyst , but follow-up MRI was
recommended to more definitively rule out the possibility of a
neoplasm. Ultrasound showed no evidence of clots in the bladder.
Electrolytes were closely followed and adjusted appropriately
during the hospital course. The acute renal failure was
complicated by moderate volume overload in the setting of depressed
EF. The patient was continued on Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. Urology
also recommended an outpatient cystoscopy to rule out tumor versus
Foley trauma as the cause of the patient's hematuria.
Heme: Following cardiac catheterization , the patient developed
epistaxis , frank hematuria , and coffee-ground emesis ( secondary to
swallowing blood and not a GI bleed ). The hematocrit fell to 29
and the patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood
cells. Heparin and Tegralen were stopped , the patient was
continued on aspirin and Plavix. The hematuria resolved , and no
clots were seen on abdominal ultrasound. The hematocrit remained
stable throughout the rest of the patient's hospital course.
Endocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was maintained on TZI
sliding scale while in-house , later was restarted on his home
regimen of insulin 70/30 , and was discharged on this home regimen.
DISPOSITION: At the time of discharge the patient was ambulating ,
and arrangement were made for the patient to receive
a walker for assistance with ambulation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Discharge medications include aspirin 325
mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
hydralazine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lopressor
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 0.4 mg SL q.5 minutes x 3
p.r.n. chest pain , Zocor 80 mg p.o. q.h.s. , insulin 70/30 40 units
s.c. b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up includes an appointment with Dr. Auricchio on
0/10/02 , cystoscopy with Dr. Sacchetti on 7/14/02 ,
abdominal MRI on 6/28/02 , and an appointment with Dr. Neufer
within one month.
