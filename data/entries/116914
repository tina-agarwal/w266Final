Discharge Date: 4/22/1997
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ( 1 ) UNSTABLE ANGINA
( 2 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
( 3 ) DIABETES MELLITUS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old female
with history of coronary artery
disease who presented with unstable angina. The patient's cardiac
risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , and
post-menopausal. She presented to an outside hospital in 1992 with
substernal chest pain. A cardiac catheterization at that time
revealed an right coronary artery with diffuse disease , moderate to
severe proximal left anterior descending artery lesion at diagonal
1 , moderate mid- left anterior descending artery lesion , and a
tight left circumflex. She underwent a PTCA of the left circumflex
artery with improvement. She was well until approximately one year
ago when she began having exertional chest pain. Her chest pain
has been worsening over the past several months and has been
occurring with less and less exertion. She was admitted in August
of 1996 for chest pain and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
An exercise Thallium test was negative. She was well until February
of 1997 when she again developed exertional chest pain. She said
that the chest pain was substernal. It had no radiation and no
nausea or vomiting and no diaphoresis. She had an exercise test on
0/21/97 where she was only able to exercise for three minutes and
stopped secondary to shortness of breath. She was scheduled for an
elective catheterization on 8/27/97 but her chest pain has been
slowly worsening over the past couple of months. She reports a
history of exertional chest pain at only one-half block. Normally
her chest pain was relieved with one sublingual nitroglycerin. On
the evening prior to admission she woke up at 3 a.m. with severe
substernal chest pain. She had no relief with three sublingual
nitroglycerin and , therefore , presented to the emergency room.
In the emergency room she was made pain-free with IV nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as above. Diabetes
mellitus.
MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , and Metformin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room
department with chest pain but became pain-free
with sublingual nitroglycerin. The heparin was started in the
emergency room and the patient was given aspirin. The patient's
admission ECG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with no changes from
her previous ECG.
During the first several days of admission the patient began
complaining of some left chest pain but , on further questioning ,
the pain was under her left breast and radiating to her right back
and she was tender to palpation. Examination under the left breast
revealed three to four vesicles on an erythematous base felt to be
consistent with zoster. The patient was therefore started on
Famvir with some improvement of the pain and the lesion. In
addition to the superficial chest pain the patient did have some
chest pain which was felt to be cardiac in origin although she did
not have any ECG changes. She was continued on nitroglycerin and
heparin and her Lopressor was increased as tolerated.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 5/2/97.
Although the final catheterization report is not available yet , the
catheterization showed three vessel disease with normal left
ventricular function. It was felt that the patient needed to go
for coronary artery bypass graft but , due to the fact that she had
the herpes zoster under her left breast , it was decided to wait to
do the coronary artery bypass graft until her zoster had improved.
Therefore the patient was discharged to home and will undergo
coronary artery bypass graft in several weeks. Prior to discharge
the patient was seen by surgery and anesthesia for her preoperative
workup. There were no complications.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , NPH
26 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. , Lopressor 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q5m times three ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q4h p.r.n.
pain , Zocor 20 mg p.o. qhs , Famciclovir 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. times 7
days. FOLLOWUP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Alexis Iannotti
on 5/21/97 and will follow-up with cardiac surgery.
