ATTENDING: HARRISON BOTRAS MD
DISCHARGE DATE: 10/24/04 , anticipated.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Aortic stenosis , COPD , cough , diabetes ,
history of DVT , hypertension , GERD.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old man with a
history of coronary artery disease , COPD , end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis , and ischemic cardiomyopathy presenting as a
transfer from Nivi Niot Rehabilitation Center for management of ischemic
cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. Briefly , he was admitted to
Tawde Memorial Hospital on 9/20/04 , with varied symptoms including
a nonproductive cough , bronchospasm , and shortness of breath. He
also was hypoglycemic with a glucose of 34 , likely due to
anorexia and continued used of regular amounts of insulin. He
was found to have positive cardiac enzymes as well with a
troponin peaking at approximately 4.3 , and was seen by
Cardiology , Renal Services in consultation. Concurrently , he was
treated with a course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone for
presumed bronchitis. The initial plan recommended by Cardiology
included an echocardiogram , which was read at that time ,
indicated decreased ejection fraction of only about 15% to 20%.
This represented a change from prior. The next step intended was
for a cardiac catheterization , but there was concern regarding
his aortic stenosis which despite a gradient of only 14% on
echocardiogram , was concerning , as this might represent an
underestimation. He was transferred to Mid-li Ners Lini Medical Center for further evaluation of both the need for aortic valve
replacement and this new reduced ejection fraction , felt to
likely be ischemic cardiomyopathy , with a demand related
non-ST-elevation MI.
Of note , he also had a pulmonary artery pressure of 68 on his
prior echo. He has had a cardiac cath in 2000 showing
well-preserved ventricular function , overall EF 60% , with LAD 30%
to 40% , 60% diagonal , 100% RCA , 60% OMB , and diffuse circumflex
disease.
Shortly before transfer , he was hemodialyzed as regularly
scheduled. He had been placed on a prednisone taper for
questionable COPD exacerbation.
At this time , he denies any chest pain or chest heaviness now or
prior to admission. He has no back or jaw pain. He does have
shortness of breath with a nonproductive cough and wheezes. No
fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting. No orthopnea. Increased lower
extremity edema and increased salty food intake immediately prior
to Ronbranch Ded Memorial Hospital hospitalization. He was feeling well one week
prior to admission at Disekend .

with Q waves in III and aVF.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 78-year-old man with coronary artery
disease , diabetes , end-stage renal disease , COPD , aortic
stenosis , here with shortness of breath , and increased troponins.
The most concerning feature was interval decrease in ejection
fraction from 60% to 10% to 15% over a four-year interval.
Slightly ischemic concerning with old inferior MI and with
elevated troponins.
COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: He was maintained on aspirin , statin , and
ACE ( renally dosed ). Beta-blocker held secondary to
bronchospasm. His echo was reevaluated and felt to be close at
30% ejection fraction. He had a diagnostic cardiac
catheterization to assess his aortic stenosis on 9/0/04 . The
findings were an aortic valve area of 1.2 to 1.6 cm2 with aortic
gradient of 21.1. His pulmonary artery pressure was peak of 61 ,
mean of 35. His vessels showed an LAD ostial 70% lesion , and LAD
proximal to mid 70% tubular lesion , a large marginal 80% lesion
left circumflex , a 100% occluded right coronary artery , with left
to right collaterals. It was also found to have a difficult
placing a right IJ catheter , likely occluded.
2. Cardiac surgery was consulted and these findings were
discussed. It was felt that he was a better candidate for
percutaneous stenting rather than immediate surgery given the
balance between his only mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis and the
high risks of surgery. Accordingly , he was observed over the
weekend and had a repeat catheterization on 9/22/04 with
stenting of the left circumflex marginal lesion from 99% to 0%
with a drug-eluting stent. He tolerated this procedure well
without hematoma and with maintenance of dopplerable pedal
pulses.
3. Pulmonary: He continued to have good oxygen saturations on 4
liters. After several days , he was tapered to 0 mg of
prednisone; he continued to have severe cough that gradually
improved , nonproductive throughout. He was on antitussive
medications as needed. He completed a course of azithromycin
that had been started at Teety Flandter Bassba Of Medical Center .  Chest x-rays were
clear x 2. He attempted PFTs , but his vital capacity was
severely limited by cough. However , his FEV1 was 0.89 , 40% of
predicted.
4. Hematologic: His Coumadin was held given the unclear need
for acute anticoagulation ( remote DVT , already protected by IVC
filter ) and the concern that he might need an intervention. This
was started shortly before discharge with the expectation he
would follow up as prior to admission with his INRs.
5. Renal: He was seen by the Renal Team and dialyzed to his dry
weight on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday schedule.
6. Endocrine: His blood sugars were somewhat labile ranging
from the 300s to the 40s. This was complicated by the use of
prednisone. Post prednisone , he was placed on home regimen of 14
units q.a.m. , 8 units q.p.m. of NPH , and 8 units regular q.a.m.
