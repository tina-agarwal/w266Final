1 ) CV: HTN: Unclear precipitant for intermittent HTN - ?2/2 renal
known renal artery stenosis , HR lability , autonomic syndrome.
Given h/o tachy-brady and difficult to control afib w/bradycardia and

inserted without difficulty on 10/13 - programmed to DDI 60 mode. BB was
initiated and plan to continue Toprol XL upon discharge. Plan to continue
clindamycin qid to complete 3 day course and to f/u with EP in 2wks. Upon

Plavix now , with plan to f/u with Dr. Breck for discussion of risks/benefits
of initiating coumadin.
