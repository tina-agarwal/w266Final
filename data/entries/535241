Discharge Date: 6/29/1991
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 59 year old white female
with a history of coronary artery
disease status post bypass in l988 who presented with atypical
chest pain consistent with unstable angina for rule out myocardial
infarction. Patient has multiple risk factors including a history
of inferior myocardial infarction , smoking history , family history ,
and age. She does not have diabetes mellitus or increased
cholesterol. In 6/11 , she had an inferior myocardial infarction
and had a catheterization in May of l988 showing 70% left anterior
descending , 50% right circumflex , and l00% right coronary artery
lesion with an ejection fraction of 80%. In l988 , she had three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft with a LIMA to her left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to her OMB2 and right
coronary artery. The patient also has a history of peptic ulcer
disease diagnosed with melena in 1/7 and had an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral gastritis. In 6/17 , she
had a colonoscopy that showed diverticula and she has a history of
chronic anemia with a hematocrit in the mid to high twenties and an
MCV of 68. Patient was treated with H2 blockers and iron but
stopped secondary to constipation. In 2/10 , the patient again
presented with orthostatic changes and shortness of breath with
pain to her arm similar to her previous myocardial infarction pain.
Her hematocrit at that time was 20.8. She was transfused three
units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix and H2 blockers.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a catheterization
in 2/10 that showed patent LIMA to her left anterior descending ,
her left anterior descending native vessel was free of disease , and
a 50% long proximal circumflex lesion as well as a proximal OM2
lesion that was narrowed to 70% at its origin. An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy at that time was negative and the
patient was discharged home for colonoscopy with Small Bowel
Follow-Through that was never done. In the interval period prior
to admission , the patient was in her usual state of fair health
when she had an hour of chest pain in the morning and thirty
minutes in the evening per week. She also noted several episodes
at rest principally with increased anxiety and with confusion. The
patient presented to GH with a thirty minute history of
substernal chest pressure that was not responsive to sublingual
Nitroglycerin and was associated with diaphoresis and mild
shortness of breath. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for
coronary artery disease as described above , peptic ulcer disease as
above , left neck basal carcinoma in l986 , chronic iron deficiency
anemia , history of biliary colic and hiatal hernia , history of
chronic vertigo , and history of a thyroid nodule in the past.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her blood pressure was l22/90 ,
pulse of 90 , respiratory rate of l6 , and
temperature 98.2. HEENT: Unremarkable. LUNGS: Clear to
auscultation. NECK: Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Showed non-displaced point of maximal intensity ,
regular rate and rhythm with a positive S4. There were no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. She had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits.
ABDOMEN: Showed active bowel sounds and was obese , soft , and
non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. EXTREMITIES:
Showed 2+ femoral , radial , and dorsalis pedis pulses without
bruits. She had no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. RECTAL: Showed
normal tone without masses and was guaiac negative. NEUROLOGICAL:
Grossly non-focal and within normal limits.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Of note , she had a hematocrit of 27.0 with
a white count of 6.9 and an MCV of 63.
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with axis of 20 degrees ,
intervals of 0.l6 , 0.08 , and 0.40 with a Q wave in III , and T wave
inversions in III , V3 , and Vl-V4. These were all unchanged from
her previous EKG from 5/10
HOSPITAL COURSE: Remarkable only for a rule out myocardial
infarction in which she had serial CK and EKG
that were completely within normal limits. Her CK were l54 , 482 ,
and 592 with normal MB fractions most consistent with either a very
small myocardial infarction or , more likely , CK leak from some
other source. Patient had several episodes of atypical chest pain
after being moved down to the floor and EKG were completely within
normal limits without any evidence of acute changes. Patient was
transferred to the floor on July and her significant laboratory
data included a white blood cell count of 5.89 , hematocrit 34 ,
platelets 458 , and MCV of 68. Calcium was 9.4 , magnesium 2.6 ,
sodium l37 , potassium 4.6 , chloride l03 , bicarbonate 22 , BUN l8 ,
creatinine l.l , and glucose 9l. Serial CK were l54 , 482 , 592 , 553 ,
464 , and 3l2 , with MB fractions all less than l0. Her iron was l4
and her TIBC was 479 with a ferritin pending. Urinalysis showed
20-30 white blood cells with 3+ bacteria and a urine culture showed
greater than l00 , 000 E. coli. This was treated with Bactrim. On
August , the patient had no more episodes of chest pain and had an
exercise stress test on which he went nine minutes on a modified
Bruce protocol stopping secondary to fatigue. Her peak heart rate
was 95 , blood pressure l75/75 without chest pain , and only unifocal
premature ventricular contractions with her exercise. She had
non-specific ST and T wave changes only without evidence for
ischemia. This was thought to be inconsistent with ongoing
ischemia and the patient was discharged to home. Of note , the
patient is not an AKH patient and has no primary doctor.
Therefore , I am going to assume her care as an out-patient in NIDA TION HOSPITAL .
Pending laboratory data includes ferritin level.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Exercise tolerance test as above and
blood products received were none.
DISPOSITION: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Aspirin , ECASA , 80 mg
p.o. q.d. 2 ) Bactrim one tablet double-strength
p.o. b.i.d. times seven days. 3 ) Sublingual Nitroglycerin one q.5
minutes with chest pain as directed. 4 ) Metoprolol 75 mg p.o.
t.i.d. 5 ) Iron Sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) Pepcid 20 mg p.o.
b.i.d. The patient will be followed in my clinic in the next
available and I have scheduled her for an Upper Series With Small
Bowel Follow-Through to follow-up on her gastrointestinal bleeding.
I started her on Iron Sulfate and have encouraged her to make sure
that she takes this in order to increase her hematocrit.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST CORONARY
ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT , URINARY TRACT INFECTION ,
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED , AND IRON DEFICIENCY
ANEMIA.
