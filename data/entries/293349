Imp: 74 yo woman with pulmonary sarcoid and CHF and CRI here with SOB
after stopping lasix several weeks ago. Given clinical exam and CXR it
appears that she is in decompensated CHF , and in worse renal failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1 ) Cardiovascular: She was in mildly decompensated CHF , and was started
on more aggressive diuresis , starting with lasix 40 iv BID increased to 80
bid on HD2 as she was not meeting her diuresis goal. With cardiology
service consulting , she was increase to lasix drip at 15/hr on HD3 , with
i/o goal 1-2 l neg. She did well on this and by HD5 was near her dry
weight of 49kg and her drip was transitioned back to PO lasix. She is no
on lasix 80 po bid , which is felt to be adequate to maintain her dry
weight. She was continued on Hydralazine , lopressol and was restarted on
Isordil on HD3 , titrated up to 20 tid. She has history of MI with
stents and was continued on Asa , Plavix , Zocor. He cardiac enzymes were
negative. Her BNP fell from 3500 on admit to 1500 at her dry wt on HD6.
She was paced intermittent ( pacer placed in past for sick sinus ,
functioning properly at a backup rate of 50 ).
2 ) Renal: She presented with acute on chronic RF possibly due to poor for
forward flow in the setting of CHF decompensation. Cr up to 3.6 on
HD3 , but as she diuresed , her Cr stabilized. Renal consult was following
and recommended diureses , low K diet , good glucose control , and
withholding ace inhibitor. She is discharge at her dry weight with a Cr
stable at 3.5. She should probably not go on Ace Inhibitor again.
3 ) FEN- Hyperkalemia w/o EKG change. Improved w/ lasix. Rec'd Kayexylate
in ED. Now improved. Follow K/Mg. She should not be on an Ace inhibitor
or a K-sparing diuretic.
4 ) ENDO- glipizide at home which was restarted on HD5. Add insulin SS for
tight control. TSH high. T4 low. This should be rechecked as an outpt
before initiating therapy.
5 ) Heme- ON coumadin for history DVT. Held on HD3 for an INR
3.1 and was restarted shortly after , but her INR is 1.4. She
received 1.5 U of PRBC for goal HCT &gt;30 and is currently 30.8. Her
anemia is 2/2 chronic renal disease and she was started on
darbopoetin 25 qwk. She developed a clot in her Right external
jugular ( site of prior IV ) and was place on renal dose of lovenox
until her INR&gt;2. Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is &gt;2.
6 ) Neuro- On dilantin for history of partial seizures.
7 ) Code- no CPR if sudden death , but intubation/defibrillation ok in the
setting of instability.
Dispo: She was discharged to Wadesdi Ckgart Community Hospital at a euvolemic state with a dry
weight of 49kg. She should continue on 80 po lasix bid unless her Cr rises
above new baseline of 3.5 or if she gains weight or shows signs of new
overload. Lovenox should be stopped once her INR is &gt; 2. Coumadin dose
should be adjusted according to INR goal 2-3. She should be on a renal
diet with low potassium and low glucose but with diabetic caloric
supplements like GLUCERNA. She should receive a HOT PACK to her neck 2-3x
per day and to her vein before blood draw for comfort.
She should receive physical therapy daily with the goal of gait stability ,
home safety , and good O2 sats on 2L O2. She should go home with home O2 at
2L and with VNA services for meds. She lives at home alone and it would be
ideal if she had a relative stay with her for a few days to a week after
going home.
resume VNA services upon dc.
