HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old black female
with a past history of hypertension
and congestive heart failure who presented to the emergency room
with increasing shortness of breath. In May 1991 , the patient
states that she had a bout of a cold with coughing and chills and
some substernal chest pressure. In March 1992 , the patient had
one 10-minute episode of substernal chest pain associated with
nausea , sweating and shortness of breath. Since then , she relates
increasing shortness of breath on exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea , orthopnea and ankle edema. She also has been coughing up
more mucus and at times , blood-stained. She also complains of
dysuria for approximately the past month without hematuria. In
March 1992 , she had one episode of melena which lasted two
weeks. There is no history of peptic ulcer disease. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for:
1. Asthma since early 20's. She was intubated once for asthma
in her early 20's.
2. Hypertension since she was a child.
3. History of congestive heart failure.
4. Hysterectomy secondary to fibroids at approximately age 20.
TAH , BSO.
5. Question of chronic renal insufficiency.
Medications at the time of admission are Lisinopril , Procardia ,
Albuterol nebulizer. Allergies are to IVP contrast. Family
history is positive for hypertension. Social history - she lives
with a 23-year-old son and just suffered a family tragedy in the
death of her youngest son who was shot to death three years ago.
Habits - she smokes 1/2 pack a day. She has over a 30-pack year
smoking history. She does not drink or engage in illicit drug use.
Review of systems is otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , this is a moderately obese
black female in moderate respiratory
distress. Temperature is afebrile , blood pressure 160/90 , pulse
84 , respiratory rat 32 , O2 saturation 97% on two liters nasal
prong. Head and neck exam showed significant jugular venous
distention. Chest showed diffuse expiratory wheezes , some use of
accessory muscles. Cardiovascular exam had an S1 and S2 with no
murmur. The abdomen was obese , otherwise benign. The liver edge
was 12.0 - 14.0 cm by percussion. Rectal exam was guaiac negative.
Extremities had no cyanosis or clubbing but 1+ bilateral ankle
edema. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. Musculoskeletal
exam - there was an area of left paravertebral tenderness in the
lumbar sacral spine area.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , hematocrit 35.1 , platelet
count 246 , 000 , white count 9000 with 65%
polys , 1% bands. ABG on unclear FIO-2 was pH 7.48/37/73/95.5%
saturation. SMA-7 was significant for a BUN 19 , creatinine 1.4. PT
12.3 , PTT 31.7. Urinalysis was positive for traced blood and
leukocytes , too numerous to count white blood cells , 7-10 red blood
cells and 4% bacteria on microscopy. Urine culture grew klebsiella
sensitive to Bactrim. EKG was sinus at a rate of 80 , axis -29
degrees , intervals of .196/.116/.1478 , marked left ventricular
hypertrophy with left atrial abnormality with strain pattern in
V3-V6. Chest X-ray was significant for moderate pulmonary edema.
Lumbar sacral plain films showed no significant bony disease. An
Echocardiogram showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy ,
preserved systolic function , possible diastolic dysfunction and new
posterior wall hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Renal ultrasound showed both kidneys to
be approximately 11.0 cm in size. No
renal artery stenosis was seen though it was a limited study due to
body habitus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was carried out by the GI
service and no significant lesions were found. The patient was
diuresed for congestive heart failure to which she responded well.
Her breathing was significantly improved by the second hospital
day. It is felt that her hypertension has contributed to at least
clinical evidence of her failure. While in the hospital , the blood
pressure was difficult to control and eventually required the use
of three medications. At the time of discharge , she was running
blood pressures in the range of 140-150 systolic and diastolic of
90 which is much improved for her. A repeat urine culture was
negative and the antibiotics were stopped. Her low back pain was
felt to be muscular in origin and she was given Flexeril for this.
She has no history of peptic ulcer disease but it has been decided
to institute a trial of H2 blocker therapy and reevaluate the need
for upper GI endoscopy in three weeks time. Her asthma was
relatively quiescent but it has been stressed to her that she
should continue to use her puffers.
DISPOSITION: CONDITION ON DISCHARGE is stable.
MEDICATIONS at the time of discharge are
Beclovent 4 puffs b.i.d. , Ventolin 2 puffs q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Habitrol nicotine patch q. day , Procardia XL 90 mg
