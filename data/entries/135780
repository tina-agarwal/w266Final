chest pain. Her ekg and exam were not suggestive of cardiac
dysfunction. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient was initially
anticoagulated with Heparin. However , her platelets were noted to drop
from 237 to 93. HIT was suspected and Heparin was discontinued. The
patient was started on Fondaparinux. A PF4 Antibody was sent and pending
at the time of discharge. Coumadin was started after one day of
Fondaparinux with an intent to bridge over at least 5 days with a goal
