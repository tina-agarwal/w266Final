HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Egelhoff is a 66-year-old
woman who presented with one week of
increasing shortness of breath with exertion , increasing peripheral
edema , and increasing abdominal distention. She denies any chest
pain , palpitations , chest pressure , nausea , vomiting , or
diaphoresis. She thought that her abdominal distention was
secondary to chronic constipation and her last bowel movement was
four days prior to admission. She felt that her abdominal
distention was contributing to her shortness of breath because she
was unable to take deep breaths. In addition , she has a long
history of chronic anemia with no clear diagnosis. She denied any
melena or bright red blood per rectum. She also has a long history
of low back pain , so she does not lie flat to sleep. In addition ,
she complains of some early satiety. She denies fevers , chills ,
chest pain , palpitations , lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , weight
loss , or known weight gain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Poorly controlled diabetes with intolerance
to Humulin insulin ( she believes this made
her retinopathy worse ) , peripheral neuropathy , gastroparesis ,
coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , status post a
left femoral popliteal bypass surgery , chronic constipation , carpal
tunnel syndrome , history of Acinetobacter pneumonia in 1997 ,
chronic anemia , Charcot foot , status post open reduction internal
fixation of a left ankle fracture , status post cholecystectomy ,
history of C. difficile colitis , echocardiogram in 1997 revealing
left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 55% ,
Persantine thallium in March of 1994 revealing moderate anterior
ischemia in the left anterior descending territory.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: NPH pork insulin , 42 units q.a.m.;
Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.; Vaseretic
10/25 mg q. day; aspirin 325 mg q. day; Senokot; Niferex 150
b.i.d.; diazepam 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Avandia 4 mg p.o. q. day.
ALLERGIES: Aldomet , Procardia , Darvocet causes drowsiness ,
Percocet causes vomiting.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. Her son is involved in her
care. Occasionally she lives with him. She does
not smoke or drink. Her husband died of complications of a
coronary artery bypass graft about one year prior to admission.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Uncomfortable secondary to
distended abdomen. Temperature
97.3 , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 172/68 , respiratory rate 18 ,
96% on room air. Her HEENT exam revealed a clear oropharynx ,
nonicteric sclerae. Extraocular movements were full. Her neck was
supple with 2+ carotid upstrokes and a faint left carotid bruit.
Jugular venous pressure was difficult to assess secondary to body
habitus. She has bibasilar crackles in her lung fields. Her heart
was regular rate with a normal S1 and somewhat loud S2. She has no
murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Her abdomen was soft , slightly
distended , and obese. She had no shifting dullness and no
hepatosplenomegaly. Her extremities were remarkable for 2+ pitting
edema , right greater than left. She had weak pulses bilaterally ,
weaker on the left than the right.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 135 , potassium 4.2 ,
chloride 95 , bicarb 30 , BUN 34 ,
creatinine 1.3 , glucose 212 , ALT 15 , AST 14 , alkaline
phosphatase 76 , total bilirubin 0.4 , CK 53 , troponin I - 0.00 ,
albumin 4. White blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 28.3 , MCV 86 ,
RDW 13.3 , platelets 303. Urinalysis revealed 3+ leuk esterase with
trace blood , too numerous to count white blood cells , and 10-15 red
blood cells. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per
minute with normal intervals and axis. She had an isolated Q wave
in lead III. She also had T wave inversions in V5 and V6 which
were unchanged from prior comparison EKG in 1998.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Genna was initially admitted to the
short stay unit for blood transfusion , workup of
her chronic anemia , and diuresis for new onset congestive heart
failure. On hospital day #2 , she developed what appeared to be a
32 beat run of ventricular tachycardia. She was thus transferred
to the general medicine service for further management and workup.
Her hospital course by systems is as follows:
1. NEUROLOGIC. Mrs. Byfield continued to complain of low back
pain which has been a chronic problem and for
which she is followed by Dr. Petrocelli in spine clinic here at Go Tyredd Egebrat .  She reports that he has already made
arrangements for her to undergo an open MRI at the Taha Memorial Hospital , as we do not have these facilities here , and
will follow up with him in clinic after she has this test. In the
past she has had cortisone injections without benefits , and it was
felt that since she has no acute exacerbation of this chronic
problem and already had followup in place , further consultation was
not necessary during this hospitalization. She was reinitiated on
Neurontin 300 mg q.h.s. , then increased to b.i.d. , and to be
increased to t.i.d. as an outpatient. She reports that with this
regimen she finally was able to sleep at night and reports a
significant improvement in her neuropathic pain secondary to
diabetic neuropathy as well as sciatica.
2. CARDIOVASCULAR. Mrs. Sloas was aggressively diuresed for
fluid overload in the setting of new
congestive heart failure. She responded well to IV Lasix. She had
a cardiology consultation , and they determined that the ventricular
tachycardia noted on the monitor was actually an artifact and not
real. A long discussion between the patient , her son , and her
primary care doctor was undertaken. Mrs. Glicken expressed her
fervent desire not to undergo cardiac catheterization or coronary
artery bypass grafting because of her husband's traumatic
experience with these procedures. Given her reluctance to undergo
intervention , further diagnostic studies were deferred , such as
stress testing. Her medical management was further optimized. She
was continued on enteric coated aspirin. Her beta blocker dose was
increased to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. of atenolol with heart rate control.
Her ACE inhibitor dose was also increased. Simvastatin 40 mg p.o.
q.h.s. was added for LDL cholesterol of 184. In addition , Isordil
was added to her cardiac regimen to decrease preload. She will be
discharged on 160 mg p.o. q. day of Lasix. She was told that her
dose may change , depending on her daily weights at home , and this
should be coordinated with the visiting nurse as well as her
primary care doctor.
3. GASTROINTESTINAL. Mrs. Jannetti continued to complain of
nonspecific abdominal pain as well as
constipation while in the hospital. She also had a significant
bout of nausea and vomiting. She was given an aggressive bowel
regimen including enemas , with good response. On 11/27 , because
of persistent abdominal pain and a somewhat more firm abdomen , a
KUB and upright was performed which was within normal limits. The
next day her pain , nausea , and vomiting had significantly resolved
with the addition of Reglan to her medical regimen for presumed
diabetic gastroparesis.
4. ENDOCRINE. A hemoglobin A1c was checked during this admission
and was 9.5. Because of persistently high morning
sugars , 8 units of NPH at night was begun in addition to her 45
units q.a.m. Her blood sugars remained under 200 with this
regimen.
5. HEMATOLOGIC. Mrs. Penington initially presented with a drop in
her hematocrit to 28. She was transfused two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate increase in her
hematocrit. Iron studies as well as B12 and folate levels were
checked and were within normal limits. LDH , bilirubin , and
haptoglobin were also within normal limits. Her hematocrit
remained stable throughout the further course of her
hospitalization.
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Mrs. Loparco received a total of three
days of levofloxacin for a urinary tract
infection.
7. Finally , she was seen both by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and home referrals were put in place.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q. day; atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lasix 160 mg p.o. q. day; Lactulose
30 cc p.o. b.i.d. , and can increase to q.i.d. as needed; lisinopril
40 mg p.o. q. day; Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.; Niferex 150 , 150 mg
p.o. b.i.d.; Senna tablets , two tabs p.o. b.i.d.; simvastatin
40 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. x2 days , and then
increase to 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.; NPH insulin ( pork ) 45 units subcu
q.a.m. , 8 units subcu q.p.m.; diazepam 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
anxiety; nitroglycerin 1/150 , one tab sublingual q.5min. x3 p.r.n.
chest pain; Oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. back pain , not to
exceed four tablets per day; Motrin 600 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. back
pain , not to exceed four tablets per day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home with home
services. She will have visiting nurse to check her
blood pressure , heart rate , and breathing status. In addition , she
was instructed to weigh herself each day at home and to record
those weights. She is to call her primary care doctor if her
weight increases by more than 2 pounds , and was told that she would
likely be instructed to increase her dose to b.i.d. She will have
a Chem-7 drawn by the visiting nurse this Monday. Finally , she
will have both home physical therapy and occupational therapy
services. She should follow up with her primary care doctor ,
Dr. Vbiles , in one to three weeks. She was also instructed to
keep her MRI appointment at the Tyme Tionan Medical Center Of , and
then to see Dr. Pompei in spine clinic after this test was
performed.
