ATTENDING: LOZAYA , RIGOBERTO M.D.
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER:
Dr. Eddy Long Randklev
Vange Medical Center
Tempe Ingnor Lakenavert
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic gastric cancer.
LIST OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease
status post myocardial infarction in 1992 followed by CABG of two
vessels. Upper GI bleed from a gastric ulcer , anemia , GERD ,
hypertension , diabetes type 2 , and history of buttock cellulitis.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old 
male , history of CAD status post MI and CABG , upper GI bleed from
gastric ulcer admitted for failure to thrive , nausea and vomiting
and chronic abdominal discomfort. The patient most recently was
admitted on 1/28/2006 for upper GI bleed from a gastric ulcer ,
which was cauterized on EGD during that admission , however ,
without any biopsy. Unfortunately , he was then discharged on
iron supplementation , told to avoid aspirin and alcohol in set up
with a followup EGD in 3 months , however , since then the patient
has had persistent nausea and vomiting combined with burping and
inability to tolerate p.o. , especially solids. His vomit has
been nonbloody yellow. He also reports a 20 pound weight loss
over the last two months. He describes a chronic epigastric
discomfort over the time , which is more of a "hunger feeling then
an acute pain". Denies any change in bowel movements including
hematochezia although he has chronic black colored stools , which
he attributes to his iron supplementation. He reports weight
loss. He reported a weight loss to his PCP who sent him to the
ED for further evaluation of this abdominal pain with a suspicion
of GI bleeding. In the ED , he only had minimally guaiac positive
stool , however right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed multiple
hepatic lesions. The patient was then admitted for inability to
tolerate p.o. and the concurrent workup of cancer.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: On admission , the patient had
stable vital signs with a temperature of 98.1 , pulse of 57 , blood
pressure 158/72 , respirating 16 with an oxygenation of 96% on
room air. He was in no apparent distress , alert and oriented x3.
He had a flat JVP. He had a sternal scar. He had regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen
was slightly obese. It was soft with positive bowel sounds. He
had mild discomfort to deep palpation but no tenderness , no
palpable hepatosplenomegaly but questionable dullness to
percussion at the left final intercostal space in the mid
axillary line. His extremities were without edema with good
pulses.
PERTINENT LABS: Chemistry panel was unremarkable. His CBC was
unremarkable as well. He had except for low hematocrit of 31.2.
His LFTs were unremarkable except for mildly elevated , AST at 31.
As mentioned above , he had right upper quadrant ultrasound ,
which showed multiple hepatic lesions.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: GI/Onc: The patient was admitted
with nausea , vomiting and inability to tolerate p.o. , along with
a weight loss. He had an emergency room right upper quadrant
ultrasound with hepatic lesions , which was highly suspicious of
malignancy and he was thus admitted for inability to tolerate
p.o. and a concurrent workup of his hepatic lesions for
malignancy. He had an abdominal CT , which confirmed that there
was a gastric mass and hepatic lesions with surrounding
lymphadenopathy. He subsequently had an EGD , which revealed a
fungating mass which was later confirmed on biopsy to be invasive
adenocarcinoma , poorly differentiated. He was then referred to
oncology who informed the patient of his diagnosis with his
family. The patient decided to undergo chemotherapy with full
FOX. He was then placed with the Port-A-Cath access on
8/14/2006 and he received his full FOX on 9/24/2006 without
incident. Throughout he was controlled on antiemetics. He was
continued on his outpatient dose of Nexium as before NSAIDS and
aspirin were avoided.
Heme: The patient had a stable hematocrit on admission. He
however given his history of GI bleeding , was closely watched and
was transfused for goal hematocrit above 28. He only received
one unit of packed red blood cells on 2/2/2006 as noted. The
patient received an EGD with biopsy of his of his lesion on
6/5/2006 .  There was some problem with controlling his bleeding
postbiopsy surgery and interventional radiology were aware of
this. He was closely monitored for any hematocrit drop.
Fortunately , his hematocrit remained stable and he did not
require any acute intervention. He did receive some p.o. vitamin
K intermittently for his elevated INR of 1.5.
Musculoskeletal: The patient did complain of his spine pain. He
says this pain however has been chronic throughout the years. He
did have a spinal MRI , which did not show any evidence of
metastatic disease or cord compression. It did reveal only mild
degenerative joint disease.
Cardiovascular: The patient was maintained on his home
medications for his hypertension , coronary artery disease and
history of MI. There were no acute issues during this hospital
stay.
Endocrine: For his diabetes , the patient was held off his oral
hypoglycemics and put on an insulin sliding scale as well as a
standing NPH insulin dose. For his hypercholesterolemia , he was
continued on his home dose of Vytorin , which was administered as
separate Zetia and Zocor.
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: Given his poor inability to
tolerate p.o. , he was given IV fluids on admission. His diet was
advanced to clears and intermittently he was held n.p.o. for
procedures and for his episode of bleeding status post his
biopsy. However , he was then successfully advanced on his diet.
Nutrition was consulted and did leave recs for possible TPN
administration. If the patient should not be able to tolerate
p.o. in the long run however , he is doing well and TPN will be
held off for now.
Prophylaxis: The patient is prophylaxed on a PPI on his home
dose as well as Lovenox. The patient is full code.
Key features of physical exam at discharge , the patient remains
in stable condition. His physical exam is unchanged.
DISPOSITION AND FOLLOW UP TESTS: The patient will be discharged
home with VNA as well as with an infusion pump to administer
outpatient chemotherapy of 5-FU. The patient should follow up
with his primary care provider Dr. Rydelek and as well as his
oncologist , Dr. Moyers . He will continue on his chemotherapy
protocol per Dr. Thamphia . His p.o. intake should be monitored and he
potentially should have an appointment with outpatient nutrition
to evaluate whether TPN should be started or not. He should
continue on his antiemetics , his pain control and a bowel
regimen.
