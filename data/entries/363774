BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Lightheadness , nausea
---
DDX: Hypertensive Urgency
---
HPI: 77 year old female with CAD s/p three stents , DM , HTN and CKD
was sent to ED by PCP after she presented to office with malaise ,
nausea and lightheadedness. Her symptoms first developed on
Thursday. She had checked her BS and BP at that time and they were
300 and 150 systolic. Her symptoms resolved but returned on Sunday
PTA and persisted throughout the day so Monday she went to
see her PCP. At the PCPs office her BP was noted to be 212 systolic
and she was sent to the ED for evaluation. Of note , on route to the
PCP office she had a fleeting episode of chest "cramping" which
was unlike her previous angina or MI pain. ---
In the ED: The patient received labetolol 10mg IV X2 , labetolol 400mg
po X1 , nitropaste 3". Her BP remained above 200 despite these
medications and then she received hydralazine 10mg IV X1 which
resulted in dropping her BP to 150 systolic.

---
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for management of
hypertensive urgency.
---
CV: The cause of her high BP is not clear. There is no indication of
med non-compliance. Her PCP reports labile BPs are a problem for her.
Her BP was controlled after she arrived to the floor. She
was resumed on her home dose of Labetolol. There was discussion of
increasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary.
In fact she was symptomatic with a BP of 120 in terms of
feeling lightheaded. Therefore her hold parameters were increased to
130 systolic. In addition she had occasional ectopic apical heart
beats which resulted in early QRS complex and occasional
slight pauses &lt;2sec. No major events on telemetry. Her heart rate was
relatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. Her EKG did show
slight ( 1mm ) ST segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and her
CKMB was elevated on admission. She ruled out for MI with three sets
of neg troponins. She may have had slight demand ischemia in setting
of hypertension. Her CKMB was normal on day of discharge. Her troponins
were always negative. She had no s/s of CHF. She was monitored on
telemetry with no major events.
---
RENAL: The patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recent
history of contrast induced nephropathy. She had proteinuria on
admission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) but
her creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). A renal
ultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. UPEP , SPEP
and spot urine/protein were ordered. Her spot urine protein was 222. Her
proteinuria in a chronic problem. UPEP/SPEP need to be followed up as
outpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low.
---
ENDO: The pt has history of DM and takes Lantus and Humolog at home.
She missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent am
BS was high. She received NPH to cover her for the HD#1 and then
she resumed Lantus that evening. She also received her home humulog
and a sliding scale. She received a carb controlled diet. Her TSH was
1.2 on home Levoxyl.
---
FEN: Her lytes were repleted as needed.
---
GI: Her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and a
slightly distended CBD. Bili T and D were added and are normal. She had
no abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely to
represent a pathology.
---
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Monitor your BP at home and call your PCP if &gt;180.
2. Monitor Fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) and
record in a note book to bring to PCP appointment
3. Return to ED if you experience chest pain , shortness of breath ,
worsening nausea , extreme sweating , fainting , falling or other concerns
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up UPEP/SPEP. Follow Blood Pressures. Follow Fingersticks.
