Discharge Date: 3/15/2006
ATTENDING: MANGEL , DREW M.D.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: GI bleed , dyspnea , ESRD status post renal
transplant.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Deceased.
SERVICE: The patient has been admitted to the renal PA service.
Throughout the patient's hospital course , the patient had
multiple consults including Hematology , Infectious Disease ,
Nutrition , Physical Therapy , Social Work , and Cardiology.
CHIEF COMPLAINT ON ADMISSION: Epistaxis , melena , shortness of
breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 53-year-old white
female. The recent renal transplant highly sensitized the
patient who was undergoing plasmapheresis for antibody mediated
projection. The patient had a history of rheumatic heart
disease , status post AVR , MVR with St. Jude valve. She had
initially presented with three days of epistaxis , black tarry
stools , and shortness of breath in the setting of the
subtherapeutic INR. Her hematocrit upon admission was 14 , but
she was hemodynamically stable with tremendously elevated
troponin. Her recent hospital course had been complicated by
episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter with RVR ,
gram-positive cocci bacteremia and hypertension , positive for
bacteriemia and endocarditis. The patient had a long course in
the medical intensive care unit following admission.
MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER: Vancomycin 1 g IV q.12 h. start date
of 9/9 , levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.48 h. start date of 9/9 ,
Flagyl 500 mg IV t.i.d. with the start date of 9/9 , CellCept
750 mg p.o. t.i.d. , IV heparin 500 units per hour , diltiazem 30
mg q.i.d. , calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o. daily , Nexium , Solu-Medrol 20
mg IV q.8 h. , insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , Prograf 1 mg b.i.d. ,
Compazine p.r.n. , Bactrim single strength every other day ,
Valcyte 450 mg p.o. q. week. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily , rifampin ,
which was discontinued on 2/29/06 and changed to rifabutin 300
mg daily on 2/27/06.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION: Temperature 95.6 , pulse 97 ,
BP 109/51 , respirations in the 20s , oxygen saturations in the 98%
on 2L. Generally , she was in no acute distress and alert.
HEENT , JVP increased to 9 cm. Pulmonary , bilateral rales to
bases. Cor , regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. Abdomen ,
moderate , distended , but nontender. Good bowel sounds.
Extremities , 2+ edema bilaterally. Neurologically , moved all
extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Anemia. The patient's hematocrit on admission was 14 in the
setting of subtherapeutic INR , on Coumadin. Her epistaxis now
has resolved and now with a stable hematocrit of greater than 30 ,
status post 7 units packed red blood cells. ENT was consulted
for epistaxis.
2. Fluid collection in the abdomen. The patient had IR guided
drainage of fluid collection done on 1/16 continued to drain
greater than 700 mL per day. She had a repeat CAT scan on
6/14/06 , which indicated large amount of ascites in the abdomen
and pelvis. Fluid pockets where IR drain was placed were no
longer present. IR drain was planned to be removed by CIS.
3. Melena. Upper endoscopy was consisted with evidence of small
shallow pyloric ulcers. No evidence of bleeding source. The
patient was advanced to a full diet and was placed on a proton
pump inhibitor and H. pylori were found.
4. CVS.
a. Elevated troponin , history of hypertension , no known coronary
artery disease , no chest pain , but does have dyspnea on exertion
likely secondary to severe anemia , demand ischemia ,
ST-depressions on EKG since with the demand ischemia. This
patient's serial troponins had been trending downward with
aggressive rate control. She had a second episode of atrial
fibrillation over the weekend of 10/8/06. The patient had an
episode which was converted with amiodarone. The patient had
elevated troponins that as stated above were turning down and
some ST-depressions on EKG , which was most likely secondary to
demand ischemia. The patient had an echocardiogram while
inhouse , which showed normal left ventricular function. No
regional wall motion abnormalities.
b. AVR , MVR. Heparin was stopped for therapeutic INR on
Coumadin.
c. Endocarditis. TEE. The patient had a transesophageal
echocardiogram which was consistent with small vegetation on the
aortic valve. She was placed on IV vancomycin , rifabutin , and
Linezolid. She had positive cultures on 5/11/06 and then again
on 11/10/06 both blood cultures from PICC line grew gram-negative
cocci in clusters. PICC line was removed. She had ongoing
bacteremia. She had a repeat TEE on 8/6/06 , they indicated no
vegetation seen on the aortic valve; however , she continued to be
bacteremic. She was then continued on vancomycin and daptomycin
per ID. Linezolid was discontinued on 0/16/06 per ID. She
maintained negative blood cultures since 5/22/06.
d. Atrial fibrillation. The patient is in atrial fibrillation
with rates of 130s on 1/30/06 , was given diltiazem 10 mg x2 then
started on IV amiodarone. She converted to sinus rhythm with
amiodarone , finished IV load , and continued on 200 mg daily. It
was planned for her to taper from there.
5. Renal. Status post renal transplant on FK , CellCept , and
prednisone. The patient had a renal ultrasound , which was
negative for hydronephrosis , obstruction or infarct. She had a
renal transplant biopsy on 3/13/06 , which results indicative
mild tubular damage and capillaritis suggestive of humeral
rejection. She received IVIG x2 , pulse steroids. She progressed
to have an increase in her creatinine to 5.7 and decreased urine
output. The patient was initiated on dialysis on 2/5/06 , again
on 7/23/06 , 9/27/06 , and 11/16/06. She then was maintained on
Monday , Wednesday , and Friday schedule for dialysis and was
placed on Renagel for increased phosphate.
6. GI. The patient throughout her hospital course had
increasing abdominal fluid collection with increasing shortness
of breath. She had an abdominal ultrasound to assess her amount
of fluids and marked for paracentesis. CIS marked the patient
for paracentesis. Paracentesis was attempted at the bedside with
only 700 mL of bloody gastric ascites. The patient had minimal
improvement of discomfort. The fluid was sent for gram stain ,
LDH , albumin , white blood cell count , and differential. CT of
the abdomen was consistent with moderate amount of ascites on the
right side of the abdomen mildly distended small bowel , question
of an ileus , which began to improve as of 6/24/06.
7. Neurologically , the patient had a new onset of psychiatric
manic disorder versus organic dementia. Her mood and behavior
had seemed to improve on 8/29/06 ; however , the patient
verbalized multiple concerns from 8/1/06 to 3/10/06 about
impending , worsening of condition , and possibility of death.
8. Pulmonary. The patient continued to spike fevers about 103
on 0/20/06. Chest x-ray had showed left lower lobe pneumonia.
ID was consulted. The patient was given ceftazidime 2 g IV x1.
On 7/9/06 , the patient was transferred out of the MICU. She
was hypotensive; however , her CVP line showed a blood pressure of
15-20 points higher systolic then what were showing on her
peripheral blood pressure cuff. She had nosocomial pneumonia ,
which had improved. Her ceftazidime was stopped and aztreonam
was stopped. Her ileus seemed to be improving. She had a bowel
movement. She also developed hyperbilirubinemia and therefore
amiodarone was stopped. Her NG tube was removed. Her abdomen
remained tight from fluid overload. Her dialysis alternating
with ultrafiltration. Fluid form her abdomen grew E. coli , on
vancomycin. She was on Nexium orally. Her feeding tube was
placed secondary to malnutrition and third spacing. She was
started on Mepron 10 mL per hour , meropenem was started on
3/10/06 for a question of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Plan was for paracentesis on 9/23/06. Renally , the patient
remained anuric and dialysis dependent. FK was continued and
CellCept was discontinued on 5/3/06. The patient continued to
have thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and anemia. In the early
morning of 5/1/06 , the patient began having large volume emesis
with aspiration. She was transferred to the medical intensive
care unit and resulted in respiratory arrest , pulses , electrical
activity arrest. A code was initiated with intubation. The
patient decompensated and became very hypotensive. Despite the
efforts of CPR , the patient became profoundly bradycardiac and
advanced to PA again , not responding. After 1.5 hour FR code ,
efforts were discontinued. The patient was pronounced at 8
o'clock a.m. deceased.
