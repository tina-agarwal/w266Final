DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE: 1. ASTHMA.
2. MORBID OBESITY.
3. ALCOHOL ABUSE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Zukowsky is a 50 year old woman with a
long history of asthma who presented
with shortness of breath and palpitations. Her asthma is
characterized by multiple short admissions for flares , last in
March 1993 , and multiple courses of steroid tapers. At home , she
uses Ventolin and Theophylline. Her other medical problems include
morbid obesity and a history of alcohol abuse. She has had
palpitations in the past and a Holter in 4/3 showed only three
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. She has also had a
stress test in February 1992 which was a nine minute arm cycle
stress test with maximal heart rate of 128 and systolic blood
pressure of 120. The test was negative for ischemic changes. She
has never had an EKG showing atrial fibrillation. She came into
the Emergency Ward on 7/28/94 complaining of two weeks of
intermittent palpitations as well as shortness of breath. She used
increased doses of her Ventolin inhaler for this and continued on
her Theophylline. She felt her heart fluttering quite a bit and
intermittently , these palpitations would go away. She never took
her heart rate during these episodes nor could she characterize her
heart as being irregular. Prior to the palpitations beginning , she
had gone on a drinking binge and had drank a half a pint of brandy.
She has had a cough productive of whitish sputum but no change in
the sputum character chronically. Her asthma has been slightly
increasing with increased wheezing and she has been using her
inhaler more. In the Emergency Ward , her EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate in the 130 range. She was
controlled with intravenous Diltiazem and admitted for new onset
atrial fibrillation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above and also
including degenerative joint disease of the knees and ankles.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Slo-phyllin and Ventolin Inhaler. ALLERGIES:
She had no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with
her two children , has used alcohol in binges , and does not smoke.
FAMILY HISTORY: She has a family history of coronary artery
disease with a mother who died of a myocardial infarction in her
fifties.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was a morbidly obese black female in no
acute distress. Her temperature was 98.2 ,
heart rate 108 , blood pressure 110/68 , and O2 saturations 96% on
two liters. HEAD/NECK: Examinations were negative , her jugular
venous pressure was not visible secondary to obesity , and her
carotids were 1+ bilaterally. LUNGS: Showed scant wheezing at the
left base otherwise were clear. CARDIAC: Examination was
irregularly irregular , she had distant S1 and S2 , and no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Obese , soft , non-tender , and no organomegaly.
EXTREMITIES: Without definite edema. RECTAL: Examination was OB
negative with decreased tone. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination was
essentially non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Notable on admission were a theophylline
level of 23.6 which was elevated , an SMA 7
which was within normal limits with the exception of a potassium of
3.8 , BUN and creatinine of 5 and 0.9 , and CBC showed a white count
of 6.1 , hematocrit 40.8 , and platelets of 288. An EKG showed
atrial fibrillation at 136 with low voltage and poor R wave
progression. Chest X-Ray showed no infiltrates or effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service.
Her rate was controlled with intravenous
Diltiazem drip which was changed over to 90 mg p.o. q.d. In
addition , she was started on Digoxin and her rate was controlled to
the seventies and eighties. She was also heparinized and
coumadinized and an ACE consultation was obtained given her history
of alcohol abuse. She was not interested in further out-patient
care for this matter but has the number and will call if she
desires it. Also , a Nutrition consultation was obtained given her
obesity and she will follow-up with them as an out-patient.
DISPOSITION: She is followed in WHITELA TANRAL HOSPITAL Clinic by Dr. Douglass Plane
and he will see her as an out-patient in one week at
which time he will schedule her an admission for elective
cardioversion after she has been anti-coagulated for at least three
weeks. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. , Diltiazem
SR 180 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Beclovent Inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. ,
