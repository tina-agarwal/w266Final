+I- Pt was R/OMI'ed with all three sets negative for ischemia. This was
to examine for causes of CHF exacerbation. Pt was continued on her home
rx of betablocker , asa , statin
+P- Pt normotensive. Likely fluid
overloaded given CXR , physical exam , and HPI. Pt was diuresed with IV
Lasix in the ED. On the floor she received 2.5mg of Metolazone followed
by 60mg of Torsemide. She was then diuresed with 5mg of Metolazone
followed by 120mg of Torsemide. She was roughly negative 1.3L. Pt was
doing clinically well when on 1/16 pt's Cr increased to 3.2 from her
baseline of about 2.5. At that time Torsemide and Metolazone were held.
Pt's daily weights continued to decrease even off of diuretics. On 2/22 ,
however pt's weight increased to 72.9 kg from 70.6kg. At this time pt was
restarted on her home rx of torsemide 20mg po bid. A repeat weight was

days. Pt d/ced on Coumadin 1mg qpm.
3 ) ID- Pt had a negative UA and urine CTX. However during her admission pt
developed diarrhea. Because of concern for c.diff colitis. Pt recieved an
abdominal CT. CT showed no colitis but did show a LLL consolidation likely
PNA. Pt was initially treated with azithromycin but as her cough and o2
requirement did not improve , as well as because pt began to spike fevers ,
pt was begun on ceftaz and levo for gram pos coverage ( levo ) double gram
neg coverage , and atypical coverage ( levo ) for presumed hospital aquired
PNA in the setting of pt's multiple hosp for CHF exacerbation this year.
PT improved clinically and was d/ced on levofloxacin 500mg q48h x 7 days
and ceftaz changed to cefpodoxime 200mg po qd x 7 days.
Pt's diarrhea was concerning for c.diff given fever and high whitecount.
however pt had only been on azithromycin x 1 day. Cdiff , fecal leuks , and
all stool studies were negative during admission. Presumed viral
gastroenteritis. Pt started on loperamide before discharge to be continued
prn diarrhea.
