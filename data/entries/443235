DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute renal failure.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Acute on chronic renal failure.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Deglopper is a 63-year-old
male , stage III CHF and extensive past medical history notable
for hypertension , insulin-dependent diabetes and an MI , status
post CABG in 1989 and an unsuccessful catheterization in March
2005 , who presented following three days of oliguria. The
patient stated that for the last seven weeks , he has been
travelling on vocation , while he was awake , he noted decreased
dosages of many of his medicines specifically , he reduced his own

stated that his glucose levels were well controlled with blood
sugars less than 140. The patient reports that while he was
away , he felt as good as he has ever felt , was able to walk
greater than longer distances and over all felt much stronger.
However , he states that on Thursday night , he noticed that
instead of urinating as normal of 4-5 times per night , he was
found to only urinate 2-3 times. He did not urinate at all on
subsequent days and then put out merely a point of urine on the
day prior to admission. He reported that his urinary stream was
not the usual strength. He did not report dysuria or sensation
of being incomplete voiding. In addition , he noted that his
weight usually fluctuated approximately 4-6 pounds per day , but
that he had gained approximately 12 pounds since his oliguria
presented. He notes that his legs are swollen more than usual
and he denies chest pain , palpitations , or shortness or breath.
MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's medical history is notable for
CAD , status post CABG , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , CHF ,
obstructive sleep apnea , insulin-dependent diabetes and a hiatal
hernia.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission , his vital signs were
stable with a temperature of 95.8 , heart rate of 60 , blood
pressure 90/50 and saturating 99% on room air. The patient was
an obese male. He was normocephalic and atraumatic with equal ,
round and reactive pupils. His hearing and vision were grossly
intact. His neck exam was significant for JVD of 8 cm. He had
no carotid bruits. His pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation
bilaterally. He had a normal PMI. No right ventricular heave.
His rate and rhythm were normal. He had a normal S1 and S2.
Midsystolic and holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex 3 out
of 6. His abdomen was notable for multiple abdominal scars and a
large abdominal hernia. He had positive bowel sounds. His
abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were significant
for 1-2+ pitting edema to ankles. There was no erythema , warmth ,
or calf tenderness. His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
His significant labs on admission was hyponatremia , sodium of 130
and potassium of 2.9. A creatinine of 3.0 , BUN of 99 and a
glucose of 80. His white cells were 9.7. His hematocrit was
36.0. His platelet count was 212 , 000. His UA was negative. His
renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. No obstruction and a
left renal cyst. His chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. No
effusions or no evidence of pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Renal. The patient's presentation consistent with acute on
chronic renal failure , which was attributed to low-effective
arterial blood volume and extensive cardiac history notable for
diastolic heart failure in addition to hypertension ,
atherosclerosis , most likely contributed to his chronic kidney
disease with a baseline creatinine in March 2005 of 1.6. He
was initially aggressively treated with diuresis with IV
furosemide on admission. His ACE inhibitor was held due to
increased renal perfusion. His urine output increased over his
initial two days of admission and his weight decreased from 261
pounds upon admission to 254 pounds , three days later. His
baseline weight prior to this episode of oliguria was 249 pounds.
His diurese were held per recommendations of the renal consult
team in order to allow for further decrease in his creatinine
before he was given them again. He continued diurese and began
his ACE inhibitor therapy prior to discharge.
Cardiovascular: During his hospital stay , Mr. Sperandio
experienced multiple episodes of his typical anginal symptoms as
well as a more pronounced episode of 10 out of 10 chest pain on
hospital day #3. During each event , the patient was noted to
have no significant EKG changes and his cardiac enzymes were
always negative. He underwent an echocardiographic exam during
this admission , which was essentially unchanged from his previous
echo on March of 2005. His ejection fraction had increased in
fact to 75%. There was minimal left ventricular hypertrophy. He
was continued on his regimen of isosorbide mononitrate 240 mg
p.o. q.a.m. , which actually was changed from 240 mg q.a.m. to 120
mg b.i.d. for more continuous coverage. He also received his
home regimen of aspirin , statins , Plavix and was started on
heparin for prophylaxis. In addition , his magnesium and
potassium were repleted as necessary. The patient continued his
home regimen of Lantus , Humalog and Regular Insulin by
fingersticks and then self-administering what he needed to
coverage levels. He continued his Synthroid for hypothyroidism
and his TSH was within normal limits during this admission. The

he administers to himself daily , Plavix 75 mg , p.o. daily , Lantus
45 units subcu q.p.m. , Lasix 160 mg p.o. daily , nitroglycerine
sublinguals p.r.n. for chest pain and Lotrel 5/20 mg p.o. daily ,
