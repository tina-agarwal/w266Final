912344838 | CHHC | 57611498 | | 224654 | 4/5/2001 12:00:00 AM | RESPIRATORY FAILURE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 3/16/2001 Report Status: Signed

Discharge Date: 1/27/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old diabetic
woman with end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis on Monday , Wednesday and Friday who has had several
recent hospitalizations for fluid overload thought to be secondary
to her end stage renal disease , last admitted on July , 2001
for the same during which she had a left internal jugular tunneled
catheter placed for hemodialysis. Since her discharge in November ,
she had been complaining of increasing shortness of breath and on
the Friday prior to admission , she was at her usual dialysis
appointment where she got a transfusion of packed red blood cells
and intravenous iron when she began to feel "warm all over". The
following night , her son noted her to be rigorous and she felt the
presence of fever. She was brought to the emergency room having
received three sublingual nitroglycerin en route for shortness of
breath. Her initial vital signs showed a 90% oxygen saturation on
room air and an axillary temperature of 100 degrees. Her blood
pressure and heart rate were stable at 150/75 and 83 respectively.
In the emergency room , she became increasingly dyspneic with an
arterial blood gas of pH 7.26 , pCO2 of 64 , pO2 of 84 and was
subsequently intubated for respiratory distress. She also received
heparin in the setting of a questionable pulmonary embolus. She
had a few runs of ventricular tachycardia and became bradycardic to
the 50s. Lidocaine 100 mg x 1 was given in the emergency room.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis since July , 2001
secondary to her diabetes , right lower extremity calf deep venous
thrombosis in 1995 , long-standing diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
external hemorrhoids , congestive heart failure secondary to
diastolic dysfunction , diverticulitis , appendectomy in March of
2001 , left cataract surgery.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to penicillin giving her
edema , aspirin giving her edema , Prazosin , Micronase ,
Dyazide , ACE inhibitors and intravenous contrast.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: NPH insulin 20 units in the morning , 25
units in the evening , Zocor 80 mg at
night and intravenous iron given at hemodialysis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: On admission to the Reyand Memorial Hospital medical intensive care
unit , initial physical examination showed a temperature of 105 ,
heart rate 90 , blood pressure 90/50 , respiratory rate 12 on a
mechanical ventilator , oxygen saturation 100%. GENERAL: The
patient was intubated , sedated. HEENT: Normocephalic , atraumatic.
Pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodating.
NECK: Supple , no thyroid nodules noted. CHEST: She had right
greater than left crackles a quarter of the way up the lung fields.
HEART: Regular rate , normal S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4 appreciated.
No rub or gallop. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended with
hypoactive bowel sounds , but no hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES:
Trace edema. NEUROLOGICAL: She was sedated and on a ventilator ,
but was responsive to repositioning and touch.
LABORATORY: Her admission laboratory values included a sodium of
140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 100 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN
31 , creatinine 5.0 , glucose 193. White blood cell count was 13 ,
hematocrit 36 , platelet count 387. Differential showed 77 polys , 4
bands , 15 lymphocytes. INR was 1.0. CK was 56. Troponin I was
0.04. Urinalysis showed 3+ protein , 1+ glucose , 5-7 white blood
cells , 3-5 red blood cells. Admission EKG was normal sinus rhythm ,
flat T-waves in V5 and V6. Chest x-ray was notable for bilateral
infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 68-year-old Spanish speaking
woman with end stage renal disease from insulin
dependent diabetes on hemodialysis on Monday , Wednesday and Friday ,
hypertension , coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure
with a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1995 , notably had
several recent admissions for fluid overload and a recent placement
of a tunneled internal jugular catheter for hemodialysis. She was
admitted with fever , chills and shortness of breath on August ,
2001 requiring intubation for three days , pressor support ,
Neo-Synephrine and dopamine for two days , but was then successfully
extubated and weaned off the pressors for management outside the
intensive care unit. Her course in the medical intensive care unit
was complicated by rule in non-Q wave myocardial infarction thought
to be secondary to sepsis and hypotensive state. Her troponins
maxed in the 6-7 range , but this episode resolved without
significant EKG changes. She was titrated up on a beta blocker and
given Plavix in place of aspirin as she has an allergy to aspirin.
She was also continued on her statin. The patient would likely
benefit from further outpatient work-up of her cardiac status once
her rehabilitative course is complete , i.e. imaging and stress.
Her last catheterization was four years ago showing three vessel
stenoses of about 40-50%. She is currently getting hemodialysis
now through her arteriovenous fistula and getting dosed with
vancomycin at hemodialysis for the next four to six weeks. She had
serially positive blood cultures for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus. The last was on February , but had
negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal
echocardiogram ( i.e. no vegetations ). She received gentamicin
briefly in addition to the vancomycin until two consecutive
surveillance cultures were negative and is now off the gentamicin.
She was noted to have a loud neck murmur and had both venous and
arterial ultrasounds which were negative for septic clot or
significant stenosis respectively. Otherwise , her post medical
intensive care unit course was uncomplicated and we restarted her
insulin regimen as her appetite increased. The patient is due for
hemodialysis on tomorrow , Wednesday , January , 2001. She needs
follow up with her primary care physician for further cardiac
evaluation , titration of her diabetes medications and follow up of
her lipids , diabetes and hypertension. Of note , the patient has
refused to give the name of her primary care physician and does not
want to return to her care. She states to the interpreter that she
would like a new primary care physician.
PLAN: 1 ) Dialysis tomorrow on Wednesday , January , 2001. 2 )
Aggressive rehabilitation for her strengthening. 3 )
Titration of diabetes medications and general healthcare
maintenance follow up.
