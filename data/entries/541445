Imp: Hypoglycemia most likely from impair renal clearance of
glyburide. Possibly addition of colchinine/increased furosemide made this
worse.

Finger sticks were checked every q4 hours and FSBS increased to 150s.
Patient was instructed to eat a normal diet and check her sugars
every 4 hours and when they remain &gt;100 and near 200s , she may start
glipizide. Note: pt has a possible allergy to sulfa which manifest as a
rash after taking an ?allergy medicine. Unlikely to have rash as tolerates
lasix ( sulfa containing ). Will have pt monitor for rash and call if has
any difficulties/prolonged hypoglycemia. VNA services to check in on
