lightheadedness and dizziness associated with her chemo but she
denies fevers , chills , sweats in the past 72 to 96 hours prior to
admission. She did have chest pain on 1/22/06 two days after
her chemo but none since and in the time leading up to her
hospitalization.
ADMISISON PHYSICAL EXAM: Temperature was 98.9 , pulse 98 , blood
pressure 132/55 , respiratory rate 16 , 95% on room air. The
patient's physical exam was significant for alopecia and obesity.
She was in no acute distress , alert and oriented. Her pupils
were equal , round and reactive. Conjunctivae were pink. She was
anicteric and her oropharynx was clear. JVP was hard to assess
due to neck fullness and she wears hearing aids. The lungs were
clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds with
crackles at the left base. Cardiovascular exam was regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 , S2 and no murmur , rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft and benign. Extremities had trace to 1+ edema.
The patient had an approximately 4 x 2 cm area of redness but no
swelling , positive warmth and positive tenderness on the dorsal
surface of her right hand. She had a pustular lesion on her left
fourth digit and right third digit that had been I&amp;D in AH
Urgent Care.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs are significant for creatinine of 1 , white
blood cell count of 4.33 , hematocrit of 25.5 and platelets of
108. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a leftward axis and
first degree AV block. Chest x-ray was unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: This is a 72-year-old woman with
stage III or stage IV breast cancer who now presents with
paronychia and possible cellulitis of her right and left hands.
Infectious Disease: The patient was initially started on IV
vancomycin given the proximity of her recent chemotherapy. Her
finger lesions and dorsal right hand lesions began to heal within
two days of her admission. She underwent incision and drainage
of her left hand's pustular lesion with improved speed of healing
and decreased pain. After 48 hours in the hospital the patient's
vancomycin was switched to Keflex at which time the patient
developed a area of redness on her left forearm that measured
approximately 6 cm x 4 cm in area. The lesion was notable for an
erythematous base with punctuate red lesions that did not appear
to be blanching. At the same time , she developed a very similar
lesion on her right index finger between her MCP and PIP. The
patient was switched back to IV vancomycin and the Infectious
Disease consultants were called to assist with the management of
the patient's evolving lesions. A TTE was obtained that showed no
vegetations and serial blood cultures showed no bacteremia. The
Infectious Disease consultants suggested that the patient had
paronychia in her digits with transfer of bacterial infestation
due to skin breakdown in the area around her nails on her hands.
The concern for septic emboli for which the patient was initially
treated became less likely in the setting of the new lesions that
were not in distribution that has been consistent with septic
emboli. 48 hours later the patient was again switched from
vancomycin to Keflex and within 12 hours developed new
maculopapular rash on her right neck and furuncles on her left
and right outer labia that were exquisitely painful. The patient
was given one more dose of IV vancomycin and then resumed on
Keflex. Dermatologists were consulted to help determine whether
the patient was suffering from shingles and they deemed that she
was not and that her new rash was likely eczematous in nature and
topical steroid creams were prescribed. The new rash on the
right neck quickly resolved and the furuncles on her labia were
symptomatically managed with sitz bath three times daily in
addition to her oral cephalosporin antibiotic.
Throughout the course of evolving dermatologic findings that the
patient experienced and the pain associated with them the patient
had continued to have absolutely no systemic complications
associated with these lesions. In particular , she did not have
fever at all during the course of her hospitalization , she did
not have chills or sweats , she developed no new heart murmurs ,
and her blood cultures remained negative throughout the course.
The patient was started on IV acyclovir when her new rash
developed and on the day of discharge was switched over to
Valtrex 1000 mg t.i.d. for management of presumed HSV infection
though cultures remained pending at the time of discharge. The
patient will be discharged on Keflex and Valtrex to complete a
course of ten days on each.
Endocrine: The patient has a history of type II diabetes , was
placed on a weight based insulin regimen with good effect during
the course of her hospitalization. On discharge , she will resume
her Lantus 40 units nightly.
Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of diastolic
dysfunction with a clean cath in 2005. Her aspirin , statin ,
Zestril , Cardizem , Lasix and nitrates were continued during the
course of her hospitalization in the same way that she takes them
at home with very well controlled blood pressures and no issues
with her rhythm.
The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea but does not
use CPAP and do not have any difficulties with her oxygenation
even while sleeping.
Heme: The patient was initially anemic and thrombocytopenic on
admission. She received one unit of packed red blood cells and
her hematocrit remained stable through the duration of her
hospitalization.
Oncology: The patient has ductal carcinoma and inflammatory
breast cancer that is likely stage IV and she is status post
cycle 2 of 16 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin and
cytoxan with a plan for surgical removal after her
chemotherapy.
