AMC 1/21 PET myocardial viability study: 1. A large region of myocardial
scar in the mid-LAD distribution , without residual stress induced
peri-infarct ischemia. 2. Large regions of viable myocardium in the
distribution of the proximal to mid-LAD , left circumflex and RCA coronary
arteries. 3. Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.
