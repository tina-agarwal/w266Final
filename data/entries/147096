Discharge Date: 11/13/1999
IDENTIFICATION: This is a 58-year-old gentleman admitted for an
EPS study.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old white male
status post aortic root homograft in
1995 for aortic insufficiency secondary to a bicuspid aorta. The
patient was doing very well. He was followed biannually by Dr.
Fleek Recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
65% with the graft intact. The patient noted several episodes of
light-headedness over the last several weeks. Most recently while
playing tennis he collapsed; however , denied loss of consciousness.
He denied palpitations. The patient was seen today in Dr.
Kaffka clinic where he had a ETT test which was stopped
secondary to runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Polio in 1955 , aortic valve root homograft
in 1999.
MEDICATIONS: Cardizem CD 240 milligrams q.d. , Vasotec 5 milligrams
b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco and alcohol. He is married with
two children.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for arrhythmias.
ALLERGIES: None.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.9 , heart rate 87 , blood
pressure 146/96 , saturating at 96% on room
air. In general , obese male in no acute distress. HEENT: Moist
mucous membranes. There is a left facial droop with decreased
muscle tone. Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , obese. Normal bowel sounds. Extremities: No
edema. Neurologic: Alert and oriented times three. Cranial
nerves II-XII grossly intact.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. QT intervals normal.
LABORATORY: Sodium 141 , creatinine 1.0 , white count 8.6 , platelet
count 186 , 000. His echocardiogram in March 1999
showed an ejection fraction of 65% , normal homograft function. His
Holter monitor showed sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs and some
couplets. His ETT done in clinic showed he did eight minutes and
33 seconds on a standard Bruce protocol. He had three beats of
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , asymptomatic. Peak heart rate
was 150 , peak blood pressure 182 systolic.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service. His hypertensive medications were
continued. The patient had a repeat echocardiogram confirming that
he had normal valve function. The patient's echocardiogram showed
an ejection fraction around 50% which revealed AI , no valve
dysfunction. His QT interval remained normal on his EKG. The
patient underwent both a left heart catheterization to rule out
significant coronary artery disease as well as an EP study on
2/14/99. The patient's catheterization showed normal vessels ,
ejection fraction of 55%. His EP study showed normal AV function ,
no inducible SVT. Repeated , new runs of nonsustained monomorphic
as well as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , some observed on
the ETT test. The recommendations were to start a betablocker and
place an ICD. On November , 1999 , the patient had an ICD placed
without any complications. The patient remained asymptomatic
during his hospital stay. He had no episodes of syncope.
The patient was discharged on March , 1999 in stable condition
with instructions to return to the Emergency Room if he felt his
heart racing as well as to avoid strong magnetic fields and to
maintain a low level of activity until after he sees his physician
for follow up. He has a follow up appointment with Dr. Wear
as well as to follow up with the EP service with Dr. Whetsel within
one month.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 milligrams q.d. ,
Atenolol 50 milligrams q.d. , Vasotec 5
milligrams b.i.d. and Keflex 250 milligrams q.i.d. for three days.
