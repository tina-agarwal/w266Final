1.2-1.3 ). HCT 41.6 with drop after aggresive hydration. Lipase of 132
but has chronic pancreatitis and is now normalizing. UA and ACE
negative.
ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN: 66 YO male with complicated PMH admitted with
hyperglycemia likely due to non-compliance and hypotension likely due
to hypovolemia. In ED the patient received 5 liters of IVF and 36U of
insulin. His blood pressure stabilized with volume and he was
transfered to the medical floor.
ENDOCRINE - DMII but with history of pancreatitis so behaves more like
type 1 - needs insulin all the time. Per patient he had been taking 20
units of Lantus QAM but patient admitted to poor compliance with both
diet and insulin. His A1C was checked and returned at 19. The patient
was started on Lantus and Lispro and maintained on an ADA diet. He was
titrated to 20 units of Lantus QHS and was requring Lispro for FS
ranging from 120-600. By 10/21 his FS remained better controlled but
were still high ranging from 200 to 400 on Lantus 16. On 3/23 the
patient expressed that he would like to leave. He is discharged o
n Lantus 20 and Lispro SS with VNA to follow finger sticks. He
was maintained on an ADA diet , however , there was some concern he
may have been eating sweets on his own. Nutrition was consulted
and provided teaching regaring diet and diabetes. The patient is
discharged to home on Lantus and lispro with VNA following
HEME - on coumadin for hx of pacer clot. Echo shows pacer clot but
not clear whether patient will be compliant enough to go home on
coumadin as he has not been in the past. After discussion with
patient agreement is that we will d/c on coumadin 5 QD ( INR on
day of d/c 1.2 ) with enough supply for one week. He will have
blood drawn by VNA with results sent to Dr. Zarkin If he his not
compliant with his lab work the coumadin will be stopped.
CV -
ISCHEMIA: Nonobstuctive CAD on cath in July with no evidence
of acute episode. Maintained on ASA , ACEi , and Statin. No BB as
current cocaine user and considered to dangerous
PUMP: EF: 20-25% Hypovolemic at admission with good response to
hydration. No episodes of volume overload. On ACEi for AL reduction.
RHYTHM: CHB with PPM in place
GI: elevated lipase with chronic pancreatitis with no symptoms and
resolution after hydration.
DISPO: The patient is discharged to home in fair condition. He has been
given teaching regarding nutrition , diabetes , and coumadin. His
medications has been discussed with him. He agrees to be compliant with
all medications , to work with VNA , and to attend all of his
