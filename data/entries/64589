Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: KETTMANN , QUENTIN M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac arrest.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Sepsis/line infection , end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54-year-old female with a
history of cardiomyopathy , hypertension , diabetes type 2 ,
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who had a reported
cardiac arrest while receiving dialysis on 8/1/06 in her
outpatient clinic at Richgo Ster Ha She began to feel nauseated and
then vomited. The patient then reportedly went into VFib and was
shocked once by EMS , resulting in a narrow QRS complex rhythm.
She was intubated , received amiodarone and dopamine , as her BP was
approximately 70s systolic over palpable diastolic. In the ED , a portable
chest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities , risk of pulmonary edema and
ABG showed respiratory acidosis. Pt was transferred to the ICU for further
management.
Of note , she was recently hospitalized at Somver Vasky University Of Medical Center on 1/5/06
through 11/11/07 for initiation of dialysis after her BUN and creatinine
had risen remarkably from baseline. She was then asymptomatic at
that time. A fistulogram and angioplasty of her right AV fistula
was performed on 9/14/06 with prednisone premedication but it
was unsuccessful and therefore a left IJ tunneled dialysis
catheter was inserted on 10/18/06 with the tip ending in the
right atrium. She has since received dialysis treatments with no
complication.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease ,
CHF , echo in August of 1999 shows moderate left ventricular
hypertrophy of about 65% , diabetes type 2 20 years including with
retinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathic pain , hypertension for
the past 20 years , hypercholesterolemia , status post medullary
CVA August 1999 , right PICA resulting Wallenberg's syndrome ,
morbid obesity , left knee degenerative joint disease ,
iron-deficiency anemia.
ALLERGIES: IV contrast , which gives her anaphylaxis ,
tetracycline to an unknown reaction , lisinopril.
HOME MEDICATIONS: At the time of admission include amitriptyline
25 mg p.o. bedtime , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily ,
enalapril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Losartan
50 mg p.o. daily , Toprol-XL 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Advair Diskus
250/50 one puff inhaler b.i.d. , insulin NPH 50 units q.a.m. subcu
and 25 units q.p.m. subcu , insulin lispro 18 units subcu at
dinner time , Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily , sevelamer 1200 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , tramadol 25 mg p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n. pain.
SOCIAL HISTORY: This patient is single and has one son and one
grandson. Arturo Randklev is the healthcare proxy and is her son.
She worked 30 years for Wi Co Baya and is currently retired.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her vital signs were
temperature 97.6 , heart rate 72 , BP of 115/66 with mean arterial
pressure of 83 , respiratory 14 , sating 100% on 60% inspired FiO2.
Her CVP at admission was 17 to 20. The patient is an obese woman who was
intubated and responded to voice. Her pupils were 3 to 2 mm
bilaterally. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her chest
exam was notable for diffuse crackles throughout with good air
movement. Cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythm
with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Her abdomen was soft ,
nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities showed no edema. Distal pulses were not palpable
bilaterally. She has thickened hyperpigmented skin
changes on both feet.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant labs on admission included a sodium
of 141 , potassium 4.1 , chloride of 102 , bicarb of 31 , BUN 33 ,
creatinine 4.2 with a glucose of 156. Her hematocrit was 32.
An ABG at 10 p.m. of admission on FiO2 of 60% revealed a pH of 7.36 , pCO2 of
52 , pO2 91. Her first set of cardiac enzyme revealed a
creatinine kinase of 116 and the MB fraction of 0.7 and troponin
T of less than assay and lactate of 1.8. Tox screen was
negative. Urinalysis was remarkable for 2+ protein , 3+ blood and
positive for nitrates , and negative for leuks , 4 to 10 white
blood cells , 15 to 25 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria , 1+ squamous
epithelial cells.
IMAGING: Significant imaging at admission was an x-ray for chest
x-ray revealing diffuse bilateral opacities , possible pulmonary
edema versus aspiration pneumonia , an EKG showing normal sinus
rhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute ST changes and old
T-wave inversion in V2.
ASSESSMENT: This is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes who had an apparent
VFib arrest at hemodialysis on 0/9/06 and was shocked and
admitted to the CCU after being intubated in the Vibay General Hospital ED. The
patient had difficulty weaning from vent and was finally
extubated on 0/22/06. The CCU course was also complicated by
coag-negative Staph grown from a Quinton catheter blood draw.
The catheter was changed to over a wire on 0/22/06. Blood
cultures on 1/10/06 revealed likely Staph aureus growth for
which the patient received continuous vancomycin.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1. Question of VFib arrest. Whether or not the patient actually
had a VFib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had an
arrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at
0.14 on 8/1/06 after receiving one external defibrillator shock
at hemodialysis. We believe what likely happened was a vagal event during
hemodialysis , possibly including a pause misread at VF by the defibrillator.
This explantation is supported by the observation that she has been
continuously having nausea with dialysis and her known a history
of vasovagal episodes in the past. Echo on 8/1/06 shows an EF
of 60 to 65% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy
and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was continued on
telemetry and treated with her home dose of beta-blocker with
good response.
2. Volume status. The patient is very close to her dry weight
upon discharge , which she gives at 354 pounds by wet scale. She
has been continued on hemodialysis with good results.
3. Possibly infected hemodialysis catheter. The patient had a
single set of coag-negative Staph positive blood cultures from
Quinton catheter on 8/8/06. Line was changed over wire
4/28/06 and was treated with vancomycin dose by renal levels.
The patient continued to grow out coag-negative Staph , positive
blood cultures from 2 out of 2 sets drawn on 8/8/06.
4. Anemia. In the setting of end-stage renal disease her
baseline hematocrit is about 30 and stable.
5. Diabetes type 2. She was treated with a Portland protocol
during her ICU course wand was switched to a long and
short-acting subcutaneous insulin approaching her home dose of NPH BID.
6. FEN. The patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet with
no signs of aspiration status post extubation.
7. Prophylaxis. The patient received heparin subcutaneously and
Nexium.
8. Code. The patient is full code. Her healthcare proxy is her
son Noble Schomberg , 030-855-6086.
DISPOSITION: This patient will likely need rehab and is being
screened by PT and OT and will likely be discharged to rehab when
bed is available.
