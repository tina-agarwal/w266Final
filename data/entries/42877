BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: Patient is a 64 yo woman with clear cell uterine CA originally
diagnosed in 3/29 - now status post hysterectomy , radiation , cycles of
carboplatin and taxol and then single agent doxil given myelosupression
and thrombocytopenia. She presents with progression of left lower
extremity edema and groin pain. Multiple studies have revleaed an
iliopsoas fluid collection which was drained recently and
previously revelaed atypical cells and were thought consistet with
radiation effect. On 4/15 she underwent an U/S of the LLE which was
negative for DVT , but a cystic struction was again noted in the
iliopsoas and the patient noted that her leg increased in size and she
had worsening groin pain. She was admitted for drainage , pain control
and imaging. ---
PMH: hypercholesterolemia , OA -----
Meds: Ibuprofen PRN , tylenol PRN , dilaudid
PRN -----
Allergies: NKDA -------
Status: afebrile , VSS , LLE edematous and tense , RRR , CTA b/l. abd
benign. Drain left groin draining serosanguinous fluid.
--------
Key studies:
U/S 4/15 11.5x5.5x2.7 cyctic structure in left iliopsoas
MRA/MRV/MRI: MRA: Normal aorta , proximal segments of celiac trunk , SMA ,
bilateral solitary renal arteries are widely patient. The common external ,
internal iliac arteries wiedely patent , IMA not well visualized.
MRV: IVC , bilateral renal veins , bilateral iliac and femoral veins are
patient. Left iliac and proximal superficial femoral vein are small in
caliber due to compression by ?seroma. No thrombus idenitified
Other finding: Liver , spleen , bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable.
Kidneys are normal in size , symmetric perfusion. Large fluid collection
in the L iliopsoas from the sacroiliac joint to the insertion of the
iliopsoas.

Hospital course/A&amp;P
1. LLE edema and groin pain: Given pain and fluid reaccumulation drain
placed by IR 6/9 and removed 3/3 Fluid was sterile with no evidence of
infection. Drain was removed due to a concern for the risk of infection
of a sterile fluid collection , particularly given it's relative proximity
to a joint and the risks that could be associated with a joint infection
in this woman. As per IR's recommendations , we asked our colleagues in
orthopedics to participate in this patient's care. They had no
recommendations for the short term given that her fluid collection had
been drained and she was pain free. Recommended that she could follow up
with Dr. Gene Alban in Orthopedic Oncology if her pain/fluid collection
recurs.
2. Pain control: Patient's pain was well controlled by IV morphine ( 2mg
Q4-6 hrs ) after drain placement- only required one day of IV morphine.
Following drainage of the fluid collection she noted that she was much
more comfortable and was well controlled with ibuprofen and low dose MSIR
( minimal requirement ). Will be discharged with prescription for MSIR
should her pain recur.
3. Prophylaxis: Patient received one dose of therapeutically dosed
lovenox pending the read of the MRI - then switched to prophylactic dosed
lovenox.
Patient remained full code throughout this hospitalization
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you have worsening of your leg/groin pain , you should contact your
oncologist.
If you have fevers or chill , nausea/vomiting , or shortness of breath , you
should contct your physician
You were treated for a seroma/hematoma adjacent to your iliopsoas muscle.
There was no evidence of infection based on the fluid collected from this
drainage. If the pain you were having recurs , or your leg edema worsens ,
you should contact your primary oncologist to determine the future
treatment plan. You were seen by Orthopedic Surgery during this admission
- their recommendation was that nothing needed to be done acutely and that
you could follow up with Dr. Clifton Walkner for further evaluation if you
are interested.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Satisfactory
TO DO/PLAN:
F/U with Kenton Babic - ortho onc if needed. F/u final results of
cytology/gram stain for drained fluid.
No dictated summary
