Discharge Date: 9/25/2005
ATTENDING: MEADERS , DONNY MD
CONSULTS: Consults for this patient included Urology and
Cardiology.
PROCEDURES: Procedures for this patient included a urological
procedure with placement of a ureteral stent and subsequent
removal of the ureteral stent.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission included Lasix 20 mg
b.i.d. , OxyContin 90 b.i.d. and 40 q. 2 p.m. , lisinopril 40
daily , Norvasc 5 b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 b.i.d. , Levoxyl 88 mcg ,
Ativan 0.5 at bedtime , Niferex 150 b.i.d. , Colace b.i.d. ,
lactulose 50 daily , Faslodex 250 IM q. month , Coumadin 5 daily ,
Zometa q. month , Fosamax 70 q. week , and exemestane 25 mg po
daily.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies included penicillin , which resulted in
pruritus and a rash.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 75-year-old woman with a
history of rheumatic heart disease , status post St. Jude's mitral
valve repair as well as AV and TV repair who has CHF at baseline
with an EF of 40% to 45% as well as metastatic breast cancer and
a recent history of hydronephrosis who initially presented with
chest discomfort with exertion that resolved with rest. The
chest pain started five days prior to admission , which is
described as a 7 or 8 out of 10 associated with nausea and
shortness of breath , but the patient denied any radiation of the
pain , any vomiting , or any diaphoresis. She also said that she
had PND and orthopnea at baseline and she had recently increased
her number of pillows that she sleeps on , from two to three. Her
weight had been stable with no change in diet. She ruled out for
an MI; however , given her hydronephrosis , thought to be secondary
to her metastatic cancer and her rise in creatinine , it was
decided to place a ureteral stent , which was done by the Urology
Service. However , after the stent was placed , she developed
severe pain , fever , and increased white blood cell count.
Although the fever and white blood cell count resolved , she
continued to feel pain , and it was decided to remove the ureteral
stent since it was not decreasing her creatinine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her admission physical exam was notable
for a blood pressure of 168/94. Other vitals included a
temperature 97.2 , pulse 69 , respiratory rate 16 , and saturating
98% on room air. Her JVP was 9. She had left lower lung
crackles , otherwise clear. She has a very loud ejection murmur ,
loud S1 and S2. She was in atrial fibrillation with a
irregularly irregular heart rate with no rub and she had a 1 to
2+ edema bilaterally and she was trace guaiac positive.
PROBLEM LIST BY SYSTEM:
Heart: Ischemia: She had a negative MIBI and her A and B sets
of troponins were negative , however her C set was 0.14 , which was
thought to be an error. Her aspirin and statin were continued.
Pump: Her EF was 35% to 40%. She was kept on hydralazine ,
Lasix , and beta-blocker , and her digoxin was stopped due to
bradycardia during this admission. In terms of her valves , she
has a St. Jude valve as well as other valve abnormalities and her
INR goal was 2 to 3. She was taken off her Coumadin for her
stent procedure and then bridged with heparin for a PTT goal of
60 to85. Her Coumadin was restarted and we waited until she was
therapeutic at an INR above 2 before she was discharged. Rate:
She is normally in atrial fibrillation. She developed
bradycardia for several days , which was though to be a
combination of some Lopressor given to her in ED when she was
having her rule out as well as slightly elevated levels of
digoxin. Her dioxin was stopped. Her beta-blocker was stopped
and then restarted at a lower dose. By discharge , she was
tolerating low-dose Lopressor. During the hospital stay , on
5/13/05 she had 10 beats of VT during which she was
asymptomatic. Her blood pressure was stable.
Renal: She had acute renal failure on admission and as I had
dictated previously she had a ureteral stent placed on 5/13/05
and that was then removed on 3/21/05 because of her severe pain.
Endocrine: She was kept on her Levoxyl.
Heme: She was guaiac positive , and her stools were guaiaced and
her hematocrit was monitored. Although it dropped initially , it
did not drop further during the hospital stay. She was kept on
her home pain control medications and she required additional
pain medications when she had her stent placed.
Psych: She continued her home medications.
GI: She stayed on her lactulose and Colace and bowel regimen was
titrated to bout BM's.
DISPOSITION: She was stable on the day of discharge. She was
discharged to home , I believe , with VNA.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her medications on the day of discharge
were Coumadin 6 q.p.m. , hydralazine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 20
in the morning and 40 at night , Lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. , Aranesp
100 subcutaneous q. week , OxyContin 90 q. 12h. and 40 q. 2.p.m. ,
Nexium 40 daily , Zocor 20 mg at bedtime , aspirin 81 , Colace 100 ,
Niferex 150 , Levoxyl 88 , Senna daily , and exemestane 25 mg po

FOLLOWUP: She was instructed to follow up with her PCP.
