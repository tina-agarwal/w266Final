EKG: no significant changes , long QTc at baseline
IMP: 72 year old woman w/ MMP , depression/FTT , presents with
pleuritic chest pain and increase WBC.
FEN/RENAL: HD TuThSat , continued current regimen of HD. Renal will plan
to remove more volume at HD in future given representation with volume
overload. Electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed. Kept strict
I/O's and patient restricted to 1500cc. Continued diabetic/cardiac diet.
Patient did require single dose torsemide on non-dialysis day.
GI: ? gastorparesis , on decreased reglan per prior admission and patient
doing well from abdominal pain standpoint. Still consider gastric
emptying study outpatient. Stool studies negative. Outpatient
colonoscopy for history of guaiac positive stools. I have spoke with PCP.
Stable LFTs.
CV: ( i ) Continued current regimen. Low prob ACS with this readmission.
She was ruled out for MI. ( p ) fluid up , patient needs more fluid off in
HD and will have goal weight adjusted per renal. Did require single
dose torsemide as patient does make some urine and had symptomatic
relief. ( r ) Run of aberrant conduction on telemetry self resolving.
Followed on telemetry and patient ruled out for MI. No other events
noted and patient asymptomatic at time of telemetry event.
PULM: Due to contrast allergy V/Q scan done to rule out PE given
pleuritic nature of pain and increased WBC with SOB. V/Q scan read as low
probability per Dr. Rothschild . Pain resolved after dialysis and removal of
excess volume.
ENDO: Continued glipizide and novolog. Glipizide changed to Q5PM given
early morning hypoglycemia. Patient in the future may require NPH insulin
for tighter glucose control.
PPX: heparin , PPI
Code: FULL
Neuro/Psych/Social: I have spoken with Lafountaine , spanish social worker who
knows the patient and family from multiple admissions. Psychiatry has
seen the patient in the past per her and felt there was some overlying
secondary gain from hospitalizations given her depression. The patient
had declined medication for depression in the past but on last admission
clexa was started. This medication will need to be increased after
discharge. It was felt that the patient would benefit from rehab per PT
and that this would give time for her home situation to improve. Patient
lives on top floor and has difficulty leaving. She is in for alternative
housing.
Dispo: Placement in rehab as FTT at home and requires rehabilitation as
PT finds her below functional capacity.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Please return to the hospital with any urgent concerns such as
shortness of breath , chest pain , or other symptoms that concern you.
2. Take your medications as instructed.
3. Please call your PCP for follow up appointment at the time of
discharge from rehabilitation.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Return to hospital with any urgent concerns , otherwise seek the care
of you PCP.
2. You will need to follow up with your PCP for increasing in Celexa.
3. Call you PCP for follow up appointment and to schedule outpatient
colonoscopy.
