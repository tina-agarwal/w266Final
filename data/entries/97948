BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Gerache is a 59 yo man with poorly controlled diabetes , asthma
who presented with chest pain. Over the past few weeks he has had
intermittent chest pain with activity , lasting 5 minutes , relieved
with rest. He also has shortness of breath when he
climbs stairs , but he said that this is more from
his asthma. He presented to his PCP because of
a finger injury , and then told him about the
chest pain. Pt was sent to the ED. He has
been chest pain free since the day before admission.
His finger sticks at home have been in the 200-300 range.
HOSPITAL COURSE:

ning of 5/13 .  He has had 3 sets of negative enzymes ( elevated CKMB but
negative troponins ). EKG significant only for j point elevation
diffusely.
-beta blocker was started
-cholesterol was checked ( elevated triglycerides 308 , total cholesterol
146 , HDL 29 ). Baseline LFTs checked.
-statin was started
-aspirin was held because of the patient's stated allergy to aspirin
( causes asthma type symptoms )
-will start patient on low-dose lisinopril
PUMP: no prior echo , consider as outpatient. appears
euvolemic.
rhythm: no active issues.
2. ENDO - on insulin at home but rarely checks his sugars. when he
does it's usually 200-300s. Hemoglobin A1c is 10.7.
Patient was continued on home regimen of NPH insulin but clearly needs
better control of his sugars as outpatient.
3. PULM:
pt says he has had asthma as a child. no record of PFTs but should
obtain as outpatient. Home inhalers continued
4. RENAL: Mr. Gaulding currently has good renal function but needs to
have his Cr checked after starting the lisinopril.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You must have your kidney function checked within 1 week , please make
an appointment with your primary care doctor. Please take your
medications as instructed. Please follow up with Dr. Shiley , your
cardiologist within 4-6 weeks.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please consider carefully your lifestyle , including your diet and
exercise plans. Although you did not have blockages in your heart
vessels requiring stenting , you have started to have blockages , so the
best thing you can do is to slow this process down. This includes
losing weight through diet and exercise , taking medications including
statin , beta blocker ( atenolol ) and ACE inhibitor ( lisinopril ).
