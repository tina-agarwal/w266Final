Discharge Date: 10/15/2003
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 72-year-old woman
with ischemic cardiomyopathy status
post CABG in 1995 who presented with palpitations. The patient
said her symptoms developed about a month ago. She has had stress
for the last few months. Her husband died six months ago from
pancreatic cancer. When her palpitations developed she assumed
that they were related to anxiety. She said that she would feel a
rapid heart rate that would last about thirty minutes at a time and
occurred several times a week. She denied any chest pain or
syncope with these episodes. She presented to cardiology clinic to
see Dr. Hupp where an electrocardiogram was done and she was found
to have a heart rate of 162. Her blood pressure at that time was
100/60. She was admitted to the cardiology service for further
evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) in May ,
1995. Vessels bypassed were the LIMA/LAD , SVG/PDA. Her CABG was
preceded by her first MI in March 1995 where she was found to
have stenosis in her stenosis in her LAD , RCA. She had PCI to both
vessels in the intervening period. She had unstable angina and was
recathed which showed restenosis leading up to her CABG. Her last
echocardiogram was in July , 2001 that showed an ejection fraction of
20%. 2. Type 2 diabetes which is complicated by peripheral
neuropathy. 3. Hypertension. 4. Gout. 5. Anxiety and
depression.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Pravachol 10 mg p.o.q.d.; Elavil 20 mg
p.o. once a day; allopurinol 3 x week;
Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day; Accupril 10 mg
once a day; digoxin 0.125 mg once a day; Xanax t.i.d. p.r.n.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's husband died six months ago of
pancreatic cancer. He was a retired Cho S Ache
policeman. She has a long history of heavy smoking but is not
currently smoking. She denies any alcohol use. She lives alone on
the E Lane , Ma , Arizona 97322 but has a daughter who lives in Cosa Lare Stin
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6 , heart rate
104 , blood pressure 100/60 , satting 96% on
room air , breathing 18. GENERAL: She is in no acute distress.
HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Pupils equally round and
reactive to light and accommodation. JVP flat at 45 degrees.
CARDIOVASCULAR: She had a laterally displaced PMI , normal S1 ,
split S2. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN:
Soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES:
Lower extremities were warm with 1+ edema bilaterally. NEURO:
Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with left
atrial enlargement and left bundle branch block. Her
electrocardiogram in clinic showed a wide complex tachycardia and a
left bundle branch block. Her chest x-ray showed no pulmonary
edema or infiltrate.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This patient is a 72-year-old woman with a
significant ischemic heart disease who was
admitted with wide complex tachycardia.
1 ) Cardiovascular - Ischemia: The patient's abnormal rhythm was
presumed to be ventricular tachycardia given her history of severe
ischemic heart disease. Once her tachycardia was stabilized she
was taken to catheterization which showed patent grafts. She did
have a small increase in her troponin but this was thought to be
related to demand. She did not have any complaints of chest pain
during the hospitalization. We continued her on her beta blocker
and initially held her digoxin while we were controlling her
rhythm. She was slightly hypotensive during her episodes of
tachycardia so we initially held her Accupril as well , but her
medications were resumed a few days before discharge.
Pump: At the time of admission the patient was classified as
having Class II heart failure although she did admit to not being
very active and it was felt that if the patient exerted herself
more she would have more symptoms. On her catheterization her
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was found to be 31 with a normal
right atrial pressure. She also had a repeat echocardiogram which
showed an ejection fraction of 15% with 1+ MR and a thick aortic
and mitral valve. She did not exhibit any signs of volume overload
during her hospitalization and we continued her home dose of Lasix.
We also kept her on a two liter fluid restriction but her
creatinine soon began to increase from a baseline level of 1.4 to a
peak of 2.1. The patient did admit that she drank a significantly
larger amount of fluid at home and so she was quite hypovolemic in
comparison to what she was normally used to. As a result we
liberalized her fluid restriction and her creatinine normalized.
Rhythm: When the patient arrived her tachycardia resolved and she
was in normal sinus rhythm. However , later that evening she went
back into ventricular tachycardia. She had stayed in ventricular
tachycardia with her heart rate often reaching the 130s for several
minutes at a time. Her blood pressure was always stable in the
90s/50s. She denied any chest pain. She was given an amiodarone
load of 150 mg IV x 1 over 20 minutes and also started on a p.o.
load of 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. Over the next two days she continued to
have episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia for five minutes
at a time and ultimately her ventricular tachycardia progressed so
that she would have episodes of 10-15 minutes at a time. When she
became symptomatic she was started on an amiodarone drip. This was
done through a peripheral line and after several hours the patient
developed a mild phlebitis. She was taken off the drip and placed
again on p.o. amiodarone. Her VTAC was thought to be primarily due
to her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discussed the need for an ICD
with her. She was reluctant but ultimately agreed. We did also
discuss the possibility of an EP study and ablation but the patient
preferred the least invasive method possible. While the patient
was currently in compensated heart failure , as mentioned previously
it was felt that this was because she did not exert herself any
further , and that it was likely that she would within the next year
or two , decompensate and have more symptoms of congestive heart
failure. Because of the severity of her disease a dual-chamber
pacemaker was also placed at the same time as the ICD. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. By the time of discharge her
amiodarone was decreased to 200 b.i.d. This will likely be
decreased to 200 q.d. as an outpatient. She did not have any more
episodes of VTAC.
2 ) Endocrinology: We kept the patient on her same insulin regimen
of 60 units in the morning and in the evening and covered her with
an insulin sliding scale.
3 ) Pulmonary: The patient will have pulmonary function tests as
an outpatient given her therapy with amiodarone. At baseline she
did not have any pulmonary complaints.
4 ) ID: When the patient was given IV amiodarone she did develop
phlebitis. Despite the fact that the amiodarone was quickly
discontinued , she did develop what appeared to be a mild
cellulitis. She was started on Keflex and her cellulitis resolved.
During the hospitalization she also had a urinary tract infection
with E. coli. We were limited in the antibiotics that we could
choose. We did not want to use levofloxacin because of the
potential to prolong her QT given that she was taking amiodarone
and Elavil. She had an allergy to Bactrim which had a reported
history of renal failure. We were not able to find out any more
details on this reaction. As a result we gave her a seven-day
course of cefpodoxime given that the UTI was speciated to E. coli.
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient has a history of gout. We continued
her allopurinol.
DISPOSITION: The patient was sent home with her daughter. We did
offer for her to have VNA but she refused and felt
that her needs would be met at her daughter's house. At the time
of discharge she was not sure whether she was going to move back to
her home eventually in the Ba or whether she was going to
sell her home and move closer to family.
FOLLOWUP: The patient has follow up appointments with Dr. Stuber
and Dr. Buhr She will have pulmonary function tests.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Pravachol 10 mg p.o. once a day; Elavil 20
mg p.o.q.d.; NPH 60 mg q. a.m. and q. p.m.;
allopurinol 300 mg Monday , Wednesday , Friday; Glucotrol 10 mg p.o.
once a day; Toprol 25 mg once a day; Lasix 40 mg once a day;
Accupril 10 mg once a day; digoxin 0.0625 once a day; amiodarone
200 mg twice a day; Keflex 250 mg p.o. x 2 doses; cefpodoxime 100
mg p.o.q.d. x 2 days. Please note that we decreased the patient's
digoxin dose from 0.125 to 0.0625 given the addition of amiodarone.
