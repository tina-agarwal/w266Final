Please refer to operative note for details.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Rossiter was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive
Care Unit in the immediate postoperative period , hemodynamically
stable , intubated and sedated on Precedex. Following weaning
of sedation , the patient was found to neurologically stable ,
moving all four extremities well. He remained in normal sinus
rhythm throughout the perioperative period with stable blood
pressure and tolerated well initiation of low-dose beta-blocker
in the form of Lopressor. He was extubated in the evening of
surgery without difficulty and subsequently weaned to
supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula without difficulty.
Following extubation , diet was advanced as tolerated with the
patient administered GI prophylaxis in the form of Nexium p.o.
daily. Creatinine remained stable at baseline level of 0.7
perioperatively with the patient tolerating well low-dose
diuretic in the form of Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. Perioperative
hyperglycemia was managed by the Diabetes Management Services ,
with the patient requiring Portland Protocol IV insulin infusion
postoperatively for glucose management with goal of glucose value
less than 125. Following advancement of diet , NovoLog sliding
scale was administered with meals. The patient remained afebrile
throughout the perioperative course with white blood cell count
stable at 8 to 9. Routine perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis
was administered in the form of vancomycin IV x2 doses. Mild
postoperative anemia required no transfusion of blood , with the
patient's hematocrit having improved to 27.9 by day of discharge
on Niferex p.o. b.i.d. White count remained stable with INR and
PTT stable at preoperative levels. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily was
resumed in the postoperative course for preoperative RCA
stenting. Additionally , the patient was begun on enteric-coated
aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily without difficulty. Mr. Amelio

sinus rhythm , tolerating well low-dose beta-blocker , diuretic ,
Plavix , and aspirin. While in the step-down unit , he continued
to increase his activity , now ambulating ad lib on room air , in
normal sinus rhythm with stable blood pressure on Lopressor 50 mg
p.o. q.i.d. and diuresing well on Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. Mr.
Lisko is discharged home in the morning of postoperative day
#5 , hemodynamically stable with normal creatinine and stable
