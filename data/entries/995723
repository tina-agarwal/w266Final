IDENTIFICATION: Ms. Leezer is a 50 year-old woman with a history
of end stage renal disease , status post renal
transplant and a history of coronary artery disease , status post
coronary artery bypass grafting , now with syncope and palpitations.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50 year-old woman with a
history of end stage renal
disease , status post transplant ( cadaveric ) in February of 1997 ,
history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , and coronary artery
disease , status post coronary artery bypass grafting in February
of 1996 , left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal , who reports
having done fairly well until six months ago when she had an
episode of chest pain which was relieved by Nitroglycerin.
Approximately one month ago , she was standing in her kitchen saying
good-bye to her husband at which point she passed out. Her husband
noted her getting pale and rolling her eyes back , states that this
lasted approximately 13 seconds. She had no symptoms afterwards.
A few months prior to this , the patient reports having had slurred
speech for a few minutes. More recently , she has had several
episodes of skipped heart beats during and after which she feels
short of breath. These episodes last a few minutes and are
sometimes relieved by sitting up. The mostly happen at night. She
had one episode of rapid heart rate last week which was also
associated with shortness of breath.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fevers , no bowel changes , no urinary
changes , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea , and no orthopnea.

p.o. on odd days. 9. Cellcept 1 , 000 mg p.o. b.i.d. 10. Prempro
0.625 mg p.o. q. day.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Cigarettes one-half pack per day x31 years.
Alcohol none. The patient is on disability.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother passed away with diabetes
mellitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 98.8 , pulse 96 ,
blood pressure 120/70 , and
respirations 18. GENERAL: In no apparent distress. HEENT:
Pupils equal , round , and reactive to light. Extraocular movements
were intact. Cranial nerves II-XII normal with bilateral carotid
bruits , right more than left. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2. No
murmurs appreciated. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , and
non-distended. Bowel sounds positive. EXTREMITIES: Without edema
and warm.
LABORATORY DATA: The patient had a sodium of 137 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride 104 , bicarbonate 15 , BUN 86 , creatinine
3.1. Creatinine on November , 1999 was 2.7 and creatinine on
March , 1999 was 3.0. ALT was 6 , AST 11 , alkaline phosphatase
44 , bilirubin total 0.4 , direct bilirubin 0.1 , calcium 9.5 ,
cholesterol 360 , and HDL 40. White blood cell count was 7.08 ,
hematocrit 25.9; on November , 1999 , the patient's hematocrit was
31.9 , and platelets 279. Echocardiogram from July of 1999 had
moderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy , ejection fraction
of 55% , borderline hypokinetic inferior left ventricular wall , mild
mitral regurgitation , and left atrial dilatation. Carotid
noninvasives from March of 1999 showed no significant right or
left internal carotid stenosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 50 year old woman with a history of
end stage renal disease , status post renal
transplant in February of 1997 , history of insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus , coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery
bypass grafting in 1996 ( left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal ) ,
now with episodes of rapid heart rate and episodes of skipped beats
in association without shortness of breath. Also , the patient has
had a hematocrit drop from 31 to 26 on admission and a history of
blood in stool over the last month. The patient was guaiaced on
admission and during her stay and remained guaiac negative
throughout the whole time. The patient was placed on cardiac
monitoring and had no events recorded on the monitor. On July , 2000 , the patient's hematocrit dropped to 21. She was
transfused two units of blood and her hematocrit went up to 31. An
exercise tolerance test MIBI was performed which was negative for
ischemia. The patient's ejection fraction from the MIBI was
approximated to be 69%. On November , 2000 , carotid
non-invasives were repeated which revealed moderate internal
carotid plaque on the right. Otherwise , she had mild stenosis of
the other arteries. An echocardiogram was also performed which
revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection
fraction of 65%. The patient was taken to Electrophysiology Study
on March , 2000 which revealed nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia with possible right ventricular outflow tract origin.
It was hoped that she could be maintained on Lopressor and
Verapamil. Due to the results of this study , the patient was
already on Atenolol for Beta blockade and Verapamil was tried.
However , her blood pressure did not tolerate this medication. The
day after the electrophysiology procedure on January , 2000 , the
patient was orthostatic. She was given a 250 cc fluid bolus and
encouraged to drink more p.o. fluids and she was discharged in
stable condition the next day. The patient remained symptom free
during the entire hospital course. The patient's triglycerides
were checked during the hospitalization and found to be very high
in the 1 , 500 range. The patient was therefore taken off
Simvastatin and started on Gemfibrozil.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2. Vitamin
C 100 mg p.o. q. day x14 days. 3. Epogen
2 , 000 subcu q. week. 4. Lasix 60 mg p.o. q. day. 5. Gemfibrozil
300 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day. 7. Prilosec
20 mg p.o. q. day. 8. Prednisone 5 mg p.o. on even days , 10 mg
p.o. on odd days. 9. MVI with minerals one tablet p.o. q. day.
10. Thiamine 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 11. Bicitra 15 ml p.o. b.i.d.
12. Cyclosporine micromeral 125 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 100 mg p.o. q.
