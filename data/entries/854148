ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , IN-STENT
RESTENOSIS
PROBLEM LIST: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
2. IN-STENT RESTENOSIS
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Segonia is a 53-year-old female
with a cardiac history as follows. In
March of 2001 she presented with substernal chest pain and had a
positive exercise tolerance test. Cardiac catheterization at
Tormor Community Hospital revealed a 40% LAD , 50% left circumflex ,
80% RCA , and 90% RCA. Stents were placed to both the proximal and
mid RCA lesions. In November of 2001 , the patient represented with
substernal chest pain and had a positive exercise tolerance test.
Cardiac catheterization revealed in-stent restenosis. She was
treated with angioplasty and brachytherapy. In August of 2002 , she
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization for recurrent angina and
was again found to have in-stent restenosis. Again , she underwent
a angioplasty to zero percent. Later in August of 2002 , she
presented with chest pain; however , cardiac catheterization
revealed no significant stenosis. Finally , in July of 2002 , the
patient presented with her usual chest pain and a cardiac troponin
I of 0.15. MIBI showed inferior ischemia and cardiac
catheterization showed an RCA instent restenosis. She underwent
PTCA without stenting.
Today , the patient presents complaining that she has had a sharp
chest pain across the precordium with onset three days prior to
admission and was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Her
symptoms were intermittent until the day of presentation when she
experienced 10/10 chest pain that was only partially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and was associated with shortness of
breath. She presented to Vic Storgre Hospital Emergency Department
where she was given aspirin 225 mg , nitroglycerin sublingually
x one , and Plavix 75 mg x one. On presentation , her blood pressure
was 98/54 and she was given one bolus of heparin 5 , 000 units.
While in the Emergency Room she had recurrent pain and was started
on intravenous nitroglycerin.

56 , blood pressure 144/75 , 99% on room air.
GENERAL: She appeared comfortable and in no acute distress.
HEENT: Extraocular muscles were intact. Oropharynx clear with
moist mucous membranes. NECK: Jugular vein pressure of 6 cm.
Supple and no lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR: Bradycardic with
regular rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft and
without tenderness or distention. EXTREMITIES: Warm and without
edema. DP pulses 2+ bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Nonfocal.
RECTAL: Guaiac negative.
Chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Echocardiogram in July of 2002 revealed normal left ventricular size
and function with an ejection fraction of 60% , mild hypokinesis at
the distal anterior anteroseptal region , normal RV size and
function with borderline RVH , trace MR , and trace PR.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 143 , potassium 4.1 ,
chloride 109 , bicarb 25 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 ,
glucose 106 , calcium 8.9. White blood cell count 5.6 , hematocrit
32.4 ( baseline 32-34 ) , platelets 180. CK 75 , troponin .02 ,
PT 14.3 , INR 1.1 , PTT 28.3 , cholesterol 165 , LDL 94 , HDL 45 ,
triglycerides 129. Electrocardiogram on 2/11/02 revealed sinus
bradycardia at 49 with normal axis , normal intervals and no acute
ST changes. A T-wave inversion seen in lead III on 11/28/02 was no
longer present.
HOSPITAL COURSE: ( 1 ) Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted for
cardiac catheterization on 2/11/02 , which
revealed a 90% in-stent restenosis of the RCA stent. No
intervention was made at that time. Post cardiac catheterization
she was kept on Plavix , aspirin , atenolol , Zestril , lipitor , and
intravenous TNG. Because of recurrent chest pain on 8/4/02 she
was restarted on heparin. There was an attempt to wean both the
intravenous TNG and heparin on 7/19/02 with a planned transition to
p.o. Isordil. However , the patient again had chest pain at rest ,
leading to restarting of a heparin drip and intravenous TNG. There
were no EKG changes at that time and the pain was relieved by
nitroglycerin. Of note , the patient did have a small hematoma and
bruit at the right femoral artery catheterization site. Ultrasound
of the groin on 7/19/02 was negative for pseudoaneurysm. Because
of recurrent in-stent stenosis , the patient is planning to be
transferred to Tia Mid- Health Of in Che A Fay on 9/30/02 for
Robimycin coated stents.
( 2 ) Hematology: The patient was maintained on intravenous
unfractionated heparin with a goal PT of 60-80. Her PTT on the day
of discharge was in therapeutic range.
( 3 ) Renal: The renal function was stable post catheterization.
CODE: The patient is full code.
DISPOSITION: The patient is planned to undergo transfer to Foote Health in Mi for Robimycin
coated stents. The transfer will take place by ambulance on
9/30/02 . 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Unfractionated heparin at 900 units per
hour , intravenous TNG at 40 mcg per minute ,
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Colace
