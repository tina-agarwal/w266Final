INTERIM DISCHARGE SUMMARY
SERVICE: Cardiology Tuc Pla
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF exacerbation.
2. Atrial fibrillation and flutter.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male with a
history of CAD , CHF with an ejection fraction of 30% , atrial
fibrillation ( diagnosed in 2000 , status post 4 cardioversions , on
amiodarone until March 2005 , when it was discontinued due to skin
discoloration; since then , the patient has been on Toprol ) ,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , who has done well since a
stent was placed in 2002 , not requiring any hospitalizations for
cardiac-related issues. In August 2006 , he notes that he began to
feel weak with increased dyspnea on exertion and occasional
palpitations , although he denied any chest pain. He was found to
be in atrial fibrillation and was started on Coumadin , with
continuation of the Toprol for rate control. He was cardioverted
in July 2006 , resulting in symptomatic improvement until March 2006
when he again reportedly felt weak , had increased dyspnea with
exertion. An echocardiogram was done in March 2006 , showing an
ejection fraction of 28%. Given his increased risk for sudden
death , a single-chamber ICD was placed.
He continued to feel even more unwell towards the later end of
March , with episodes of nausea , diaphoresis , shortness of breath ,
and abdominal pain with exertion ( these were his typical angina
symptoms in the past ). Consequently , ETT was done on 9/15/2006 ,
which was terminated after 1 minute when the patient's heart rate
went up to 130. Electrophysiology adjusted his ICD , still he
reports continued symptoms as previously described as well as
decreased appetite and weight gain of 15 pounds over 6 weeks. He
endorses worsening orthopnea and PND over the several weeks prior
to admission. He was started on amiodarone on 4/13/2006 for
atrial fibrillation. Given his worsening symptoms , he presented
to Dr. Gabard 's clinic on the day of admission for evaluation. He
was admitted for diuresis in the setting of a CHF exacerbation
and for consideration of options in the treatment of his atrial
fibrillation.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. Tota is a retired lobbyist. He currently
lives in Jo Car Mont with his wife. He does not smoke. He does not
drink excessively. He does have an occasional glass of wine or
two at dinnertime.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for brother who died of an MI at age
58 , father who died of an MI at age 78 , and mother with
atherosclerosis.
ALLERGIES: Flagyl to which he gets edema and Demerol.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vitals were temperature of 95.7 ,
heart rate 80 , blood pressure 144/78 , respiratory rate 20 , O2
saturation 97% on room air. Generally , this is a
comfortable-at-rest-appearing gentleman in no respiratory
distress. Neck shows JVP is approximately 7 cm. His heart exam
is irregularly irregular with abnormal S1 and S2 , soft S3. Soft
systolic murmur at the right lower sternal border. No S4 or rub.
No heave or palpable thrill. His lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is obese , mildly tender
without hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities are warm and well
perfused with 2+ pulses and 1+ pitting edema from ankles to
thighs bilaterally. His neuro exam is grossly intact , and he is
alert and oriented x3.
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 33 ,
creatinine 1.6 , glucose 218. ALT 26 , AST 29 , total bilirubin
0.3 , alkaline phosphatase 66. BNP 659. White blood cells 599 ,
hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 196 , 000. Lipids: Total cholesterol
121 , triglycerides 166 , HDL 37 , LDL 51. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with ventricular rate in the 70s. Normal intervals.
No ST changes. Echocardiogram , 6/30/2006 : Ejection fraction
30%. Left ventricular diameter , end-diastole , 6.2%; end-systole
4.8%. Septum is thin and akinetic at the apex. There is a
hypokinetic mid to distal wall , posterior and inferior wall.
Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. There is
a dilated aortic root. Chest x-ray , 6/30/2006 , shows
cardiomegaly with an interstitial process and without effusions.
PROCEDURES: On 6/15/2006 , the patient was started on
dofetilide.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient was started with a
diuretic regimen of Lasix 40 mg IV twice a day given that he
appeared to be volume overloaded by clinical exam. On
presentation , he was compensated for his congestive heart
failure , with a creatinine of 1.6. The daily goal for his was -2
to 2.5 L , and he did very well on this dose of Lasix for the in
and out goal. He was switched over to Lasix 80 mg p.o. daily on
7/13/2006. His Toprol was continued in-house , but his ACE
inhibitor was held in the setting of increases in his serum
creatinine. The plan was to restart his ACE inhibitor following
complete diuresis to dry weight. There were no symptoms or signs
consistent with ischemia in-house. The patient was continued on
aspirin and Zetia for hyperlipidemia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Given the patient's history of atrial
fibrillation and flutter since 2000 and his continued symptoms on
Toprol ( amiodarone was not an option that the patient wished to
pursue given the side effects of skin discoloration that he had
previously experienced ). It was decided to proceed with
dofetilide therapy on 7/13/2006. His QTc was monitored
throughout this process , and the plan was for a transesophageal
echocardiogram and DC cardioversion on 3/15/2006 for further
treatment of the atrial fibrillation. The patient's Coumadin was
continued in-house for a goal INR of between 2 to 3. To achieve
this goal , he was continued on his home regimen of Coumadin.
3. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was taken
off oral hypoglycemics in-house but continued on his home dose of
Lantus 24 units before bedtime as well as an insulin sliding
scale.
