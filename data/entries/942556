BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Elective Cardiac Cath
HPI: 58 yo female smoker with hx of CAD , s/p CABG x3 , DM II , HTN , and
hyperlipidemia admitted to the CCU after elective cardiac cath s/p
abnormal stress test. Cath showed impaired flow in the inferior
and posterolateral zones due to obstructive degenerative disease in
the SVGs to the RCA and LCF-OM. Stent placed in the RCA graft though
there was extensive calcification and difficulty
obtaining full stent expansion , and following the stent deployment
there was poor reflow accompanied by mild chest pain and EKG changes ,
without hemodynamic embarrassment. Pt was transferred back
to the CCU stable and without pain. Pt was scheduled for call out to
floor , but had an episode of jaw sensation , different from previous
angina. Pt was upset by turn of events , but was calmed by staff. Was
then evaluated by Dr. Demora and came out to the floor Seygo No Wood night.
