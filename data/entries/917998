2. STATUS POST CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION WITH
PTCA.
3. UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
4. HYPOTENSION.
5. HISTORY OF ESOPHAGITIS.
6. HISTORY OF URINARY RETENTION SECONDARY TO

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63 year old man with
a history of hypertension and pipe
smoking , who was admitted with a one month history of exertional
dizziness and diaphoresis. The patient had an ETT in July 1992
where he went 6 minutes and 34 seconds on a standard Bruce to a
maximum heart rate of 145 and a maximum blood pressure of 170/90.
The patient stopped secondary to fatigue and did not have any chest
pain. The EKG showed 1 mm upsloping ST depressions in II , III and F and
V4-V6 , and was read as suggestive of coronary artery disease. The
patient was put on Atenolol 500 mg q.d. two weeks prior to
admission. The patient was also diagnosed with hypertension at
this time. One day prior to admission , the patient had three
episodes of exertional substernal chest tightness associated with
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and shortness of breath. Each
episode lasted 20-40 minutes and resolved with rest. The final
episode being on the day of admission at 9 A.M. There was no
nausea and vomiting. The patient denies paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and leg edema. The patient was treated in the Emergency
Room with Aspirin , Nitro Paste and oxygen , and sent to the floor
for further evaluation and treatment of his unstable angina. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes a history of a hiatal hernia , history of
recurrent esophagitis , with endoscopy in March 1991 which was
negative for Barrett's esophagus. The patient also had a history
of lower GI bleeding in August of 1991 , and a colonoscopy showed
diverticulosis. The patient had a history of urinary retention
secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy. He also has a history
of urethral calculi and is status post an appendectomy. The
patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Include Atenolol 50 p.o. q.d. and Zantac 150 b.i.d. The patient is
a long time pipe smoker , and he denies alcohol use. FAMILY
HISTORY: Is notable for a father who died of a myocardial
infarction in 1962.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam , he was a 63 year old male in no
acute distress with a temperature of 98.2 ,
blood pressure 110/60 , pulse 64 , and respiratory rate of 18. His
pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light. The extraocular
movements were intact. His oropharynx was clear. He had no
jugular venous distention. He had 2+ carotid pulses without
bruits. His lungs were clear. His heart was a regular rate and
rhythm , S1 and S2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. His abdomen
was soft , nontender , with positive bowel sounds , and no
hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or
edema. His neurological exam was nonfocal. The rectal exam was
guaiac negative in the Emergency Room.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 107 ,
CO2 26 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose
148. The admission CK was 70. He had normal liver function tests.
His LDH was 144 , cholesterol 171 , triglycerides 257 , hematocrit
45.5 , platelets 198 , white blood count 7.42 with a normal
differential. PT 12.4 , PTT 27.4. His chest x-ray showed clear
lungs , and the EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 57 with an axis of
-4 degrees. There were T-waves in aVF , T-wave inversion in lead
III. There was no change from an EKG in March 1992.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for rule
out myocardial infarction and treatment of his
unstable angina. On the floor , the patient experienced chest pain
and an EKG showed ST elevation in the inferior leads. As this
indicated that the patient was having an acute inferior myocardial
infarction , the patient was taken to an emergent catheterization as
PTCA was contraindicated because of his history of diverticulosis
with lower GI bleeding. At catheterization , the patient was noted
to have a 90% RCA lesion and a 90% LAD lesion. The RCA lesion was
successfully dilated , and the patient was admitted to the CCU for post
myocardial infarction care. His post MI course was complicated on 3/3/92 by
400 cc of coffeeground emesis. The patient's hematocrit fell from
40 to 35 , but was then stable. His Heparin and Aspirin were held ,
and the patient was given Omeprazole and antacids. The patient
also had an episode of left arm pain without any significant EKG
changes. As well , the patient experienced an episode of
hypotension with the blood pressure falling to the 70's following a
dose of Metoprolol 5 mg IV. The patient was treated with IV fluids
and was then stable. On 11/13/92 , an echocardiogram was notable for
left atrial size of 4.0 , inferior and posterior left ventricular moderate
hypokinesis but good overall LV systolic function. There
was 1+ TR , 1+ AI , and 1+ MR as well. On 11/13/92 , the patient was
transferred to the floor where he was noted to have a low grade
fever of 100.2. A subclavian catheter was removed and cultured ,
and several blood cultures were sent. The catheter tip culture
grew coagulase negative Staph but his blood cultures were negative.
This was felt to represent a contaminant and not requiring IV
treatment. The patient thereafter showed no signs of infection and
was afebrile. On the evening of 0/1/92 , the patient experienced
two episodes of sharp left sternal chest pain , one lasting five
minutes and the other three minutes , though unfortunately no EKG
was done at the time. The following day , the patient was
ambulating without chest pain. There were no further episodes of
chest pain. The patient was begun on low dose Inderal 5 mg t.i.d.
On the second , the patient had an ETT with a modified Bruce
protocol which was stopped at 8 minutes secondary to fatigue and
shortness of breath , and a maximum heart rate of 120 , and blood
pressure of 140/70. There were 1 mm ST depressions in leads I , L ,
anda V2-V6 which persisted during recovery. The patient was
presented with the option of remaining in the house with a repeat
catheterization with probable angioplasty of his LAD lesion the
following Monday ( 6/11/92 ) or recovering at home with readmissions
in one to two weeks for a repeat catheterization with
PTCA. The patient and his wife decided to opt for recovery at
home , and the patient was discharged on 3/5/92.
