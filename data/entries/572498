NEUROLOGICAL: The patient is alert and oriented times three.
EXTREMITIES: There is no edema. There is a right groin incision
with slight separation of the surgical wound at its most distal
aspect , approximately one centimeter magnitude. PULSES: Popliteal
pulse is by Doppler only on both sides. The posterior tibial pulse
is non Dopplerable. The dorsalis pedis pulse is detectable with
Doppler , stronger on the left than on the right. On the left foot ,
there were two necrotic areas on the heel approximately 0.5
centimeter in diameter. The first metatarsal joint has a 1.2
centimeter wound which is dry , tender and not erythematous outside
of its margins , boggy at the distal aspect. There is a small
amount of tan exudate present at the distal wound edge. On the
right foot , there is a distal lateral wound 4.6 centimeters in
width , 3.1 centimeters in length , and 1 centimeter deep. There is
pale green fluffing on the plantar edge of the wound. The right
heel has a 4.2 X 2.5 centimeter open area approximately 2-3
millimeters deep in the wound bed; pink with scattered white
material fluffing. There is no surrounding erythema or bogginess.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , glucose was 81 , sodium 137 ,
potassium 4.7 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN
and creatinine of 18 and 0.9 respectively. CK was 145. CBC was as
follows: white blood cell count of 10 , hematocrit 43.1 , platelets
425 , with a normal differential. Urinalysis was notable only for
1+ protein on the dip.
HOSPITAL COURSE: During admission , the patient underwent a left
femoropopliteal bypass graft and split thickness
skin grafting to the right fifth toe amputation site , as well as
debridement of other lower extremity wounds on May .  He
tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively progressed without
complications. He was taken off epidural pain medications and
switched to p.o. medications and resumed a regular diet shortly
after the operation. The debrided wounds on the right foot were
treated with Xeroform dressings covered with Kerlix and an Ace
bandage. These wounds have shown signs of vascularity and healing ,
and the split thickness skin graft has taken in a satisfactory
manner. The patient has begun to increase his activity with the
guidance of the physical therapist , and is now moving on crutches
with touch down weight bearing of the right foot and no weight
bearing on the right side. There were no complications during this
admission. The patient complained of some blurring in the right
eye. This was followed by an Ophthalmology consult , during which
it was determined that there has likely been a gradual decline in
the patient's vision due to a combination of development of
cataracts as well as peripheral vascular disease. It was felt that
the appropriate management would be to have the patient return to
Ophthalmology Clinic on an outpatient basis.
