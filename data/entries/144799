BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
67F w/ mult CV risk factors presents following hypoglycemic episode
and poss seizure. Found this afternoon by family unresponsive , frothing
at the mouth. FS=30 by EMS and D50 ampule given with increased
responsiveness. Was oriented by NMC ED but suddenly experienced 7-8/10
SSCP w/SOB/N/diaphoresis. ST elevations in II , III , aVF , V4-V6 w/ TWI
I , aVL observed in this context. NTG and morphine led to resolution
of symptoms 1-2/10. EKG normalized with correction of blood sugar and
anti-anginals ( i.e. by time pt reached floor ). Additinally , pt HTN to
sbp 170 and tachy 100-110s: given lopressor 5mg IV x2 and 25mg PO. She
also received ASA and 5000U heparin dose w/ 1000U/hr drip. She was
repeatedly hypoglhcemic on the floor , at least once to the 30s.

Impression: demand related ischemia 2/2 hypoglycemia
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient had no recurrence of chest pain once she arrived on the
floor , or for that matter , SOB/N/V. She initally had difficulty
maintaining her blood sugars and was given another amp of d50 and
orange juice on the floor. After the first 12 hours , her blood sugars
have been consistently over 120. Although she was very enzyme posive
for NSTEMI ( MB 31.2--&gt;32.4--&gt;15.4 today ) , chest pain did not recur. IN
fact , her EKG has been normal since arriving on the floor. Therefore ,
her episode of ischemia was thought to be demand related ischemia in
the context of hypoglycemia. Causes of the hypoglycemia included hypoth
yroidism , adrenal insufficiency , and iatrogenesis. Given the finite
duration of the hypoglycemia , the latter possibility was deemed most
likely ( TSH , AM cortisol wnl ). The patient's cardiac enzymes have
peaked ( MB: 31.2--&gt;31.4--&gt; 15.4 ). The patient's home situation has been
previouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have been
dealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. This time , there was concern
over potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband or
medication errors. Social work was called and spoke with the daughter.
She appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother's health
and open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility at
some later date. It is clear that an elaborate and effective system has
been worked out to monitor and treat the patient's blood sugars. The
patients visiting nurse service ( Lan Xiemore Medical Center ) was contacted to reemphasize
the importance of evaluating the patient's medication regimen. The
nurse involved in the patient's care also will initiate a request
for a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. Elder
services was informed to initiate a consult. The social worker at
Centter Ing Community Hospital was also informed of this admission. The
patient's home situation is deemed safe for discharge. She will
follow up with Dr. Fowlie on June VNA will visit her
tommorrow. The patient's hematocrit dropped slightly the day of dischar
ge. However , the patient was guaiac negative. Parenthetically , the
patient had a slightly dirty UA on admission. She was initially treated
but given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was too
low. Your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call your
physician if they are consistently above 150. Your dose of lipitor has
been increased because your LDL on this admission was 92.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
