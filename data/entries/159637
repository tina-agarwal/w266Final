BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
45 yo M with multiple cardiac risk factors ,
including known CAD s/p MI ( 4/14 with PCI to LAD , complicated by
instent thrombosis 1 week post-cath-&gt;successfully restented ) ,
HTN , dyslipidemia , obesity , and positive FHx
presents with acute onset of chest pain. The patient
has had several episodes/admissions for recurrent
c/p since then with caths consistently
demonstrating non-significant disease. Last cath in 8/24
showed R dominant system with 30% proximal LAD lesion.
ETT-MIBI in 5/12 ( 9:30 , 5.2 METS , HR 153 , BP 130/80 , was non-ischemic
but terminated 2/2 fatigue ) showed large fixed defect in
anterior , anteroseptal , anterolateral , inferior , LV
apex with EF of 35%. Seen 11/1 at GH for
syncope , dx with VT and had AICD
placed.
On this occasion
he noted sudden onset of 8/10 chest pain while
at rest at 6:30 pm on the evening of admission.
The pain was sharp/stabbing and was bilateral
with radiation to the L arm. He also had
diaphoresis , SOB , and nausea but denies vomitting , F/C ,
LH , dizziness. He took 1 TNG SL with some relief.
EMS transported to Greena Hospital where his vitals were 98.2 , 73 , 92/62 ,
15. Rec'd IV TNG , heparin , MSO4 , ASA with pain down to 4/10.
Transfered to ITH .  A: 45 yo M with known CAD s/p MI in 4/14 ,
s/p recent ICD placement for syncope/VT at BMC ,
now with his angina at rest. Given non-oclusive
CAD on multiple recent caths ( including 2 mos ago

is low.
