***Assessment and Hospital Course***
56yo gentleman manifesting the results of non-medical intervention
and the natural progression of hypertensive CM
***CV:1. ischemia: pt. has hx of NSTEMI and hx of CAD as manifest
by 99% occlusion of RCA which was not intervened upon in 1991 2/2
collaterals and lesion no suspicious for pattern of MI. While here
ruled out for MI. Echo at time of improved but not optimal
hypertension showed EF decrsd to 20% ( 59% 1998 ) ekg changes c/w strain
pattern , ruled out for mi. asa , lipitor , acei. Stress mibi day prior
to discharge showed improved ef to 38% and a small perfusion defect in
the PDA/OM territory with moderate reversibility. Given
significant improvement with conservative medical mngmnt ,
feel confident that pt. does not require pci at this
time. 2.pump: at admission grossly volume overloaded , 2/2 malignant
hypertension and chf. echo showed ef of 20% and global HK. aggressive
diuresis w/monitor of renal function/lytes was carried out. During
this admission weight was initially 89kg at day of discharge had been
diuresed to 79kg. Improved dramatically from a clinical
standpoint; also , of note , admitted with BNP 1374 , 701 day prior to
discharge. Feel that this is still not his dry weight
and he will go home on 60 lasix QD PO. His htn responded nicely to
isordil , hydral , captopril and diuresis. Once past the acute stage of
his exacerbation we restarted beta blockade , lisinopril , imdur. Will g
o home on lisinopril 40QD. toprol XL 150 QD , imdur 120 po qd.
**Endo: h/o Dm with complete nonadherence. EDglucose 320. Started
lispro while in house and then started glipizide 10 qAM with decent con
trol. HbA1c at day of admission was 11. AM cortisol and TSH were
normal and did not suggest Cushing syndrome or thyroid disease. He wil
l need ophthalmology follow up asap.
**Renal: creatinine clearance tolerated aggressive diuresis , 24 hour
urine was collected and showed proteinuria and a cortisol level is sti
ll pending.
. **Proph: colace , senna , lovenox. **Code: full **Dispo: will go home
with VNA for medication teaching , and BP check. Will be followed by
crestchild of medical center home chf program , will follow up with Clair K Dirth CHF NP at TH , will follow up with pcp Dr. Jack Arena , will also
