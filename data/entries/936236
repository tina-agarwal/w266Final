Discharge Date: 6/15/2007
ATTENDING: CRISTOBAL , DAMION MD
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CAD status post cardiac catheterization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 68-year-old male with history of
CAD status post three-vessel CABG , hypertension , peripheral
vascular disease , COPD who had an episode of chest pain one week
prior to admission , presenting with left arm tingling that
resolved after 1 sublingual nitro. Later , on 9/18/2007 , his
blood pressure was noted to be in systolic blood pressure range
of 220s , was asymptomatic. Called his PCP and was told to go to
the hospital. Since 9/18/2007 was in the ED observation
section , had completed a rule out MI , which was negative for MI ,
and had undergone a stress MIBI on 11/1/2007 which showed
reversible area of septal ischemia. The patient was admitted for
further workup.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: COPD , hep C with a negative viral load
after interferon and RBV treatment , hyperlipidemia , renal artery
stenosis status post renal stenting , functional quadriplegic due
to motor vehicle accident in the past , TIA in 1975 status post
left carotid endarterectomy , left common iliac artery angioplasty
in 1994 , CABG 3-vessel 7/26 . 
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Toprol-XL 12.5 daily , Lipitor , Atrovent ,
aspirin 81 mg daily , Prevacid , thiamine , multivitamin , Valium ,
Neurontin.
ALLERGIES: Baclofen and Bactrim.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile , vital signs were stable , in no
apparent distress , no JVD. Lungs were clear. Regular rate and
rhythm , no murmurs , rubs or gallops. Soft , nontender , and
nondistended. No lower extremity edema , chest x-ray was
unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: A 68-year-old male with history of CAD status
post three-vessel CABG , hypertension , peripheral vascular
disease , admitted for workup of chest pain , ruled out for MI. An
exercise stress test that showed evidence of reversible ischemia.
The patient was admitted for further workup and cardiac
catheterization.
1. CAD. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed three-vessel CAD with patent grafts to the right
circumflex and LAD. Proximal LAD to diagonals were not bypassed.
The decision was made by the clinical team and the referring
physician for further medical management controlling blood
pressure and return for repeat cardiac catheterization PCI of the
protected left main , approximately the two diagonals if symptoms
recur. The patient was continued on aspirin , statin ,
beta-blocker and lisinopril was started. The patient had no
evidence of heart failure. He had an echo in July of 2006 which
showed preserved ejection fraction. The patient had been
admitted on hydrocortisone which had been started secondary to
anomic dysfunction. Given that the patient presented with severe
hypertension the fludrocortisone was discontinued. His blood
pressure was titrated by adding lisinopril to his regimen.
During his hospitalization , the patient was monitored on tele and
no events were noted.
2. GI. The patient was continued on his Prevacid for GERD.
3. Neuro. The patient was continued on Neurontin for
neuropathic pain.
4. Psych. The patient had several episodes of confusion during
the evening slightly thought to be due to sundowning that
worsened after he got Ambien for insomnia. Per the family , the
patient has had several episodes of confusion and paranoia during
prior hospitalizations. During these episodes the patient was
alert and oriented x3 but exhibited paranoid behavior. Chest
x-ray and urinalysis were sent to rule out infectious process
actually to explain his confusion and these were unremarkable.
The patient was treated with Seroquel 25 mg nightly p.r.n. in the
short-term for sundowning which he responded well to.
5. Pulmonary. History of COPD , was stable during this
hospitalization and continued on his home regimen.
6. Renal. The patient was pretreated with Mucomyst and
bicarbonate pre and post cardiac catheterization.
7. FEN. The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet and
electrolytes were repeated as needed. The patient's code status
is full code during this hospitalization.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Atrovent inhaler 2 puffs
q.i.d. , Prevacid 30 mg daily , lisinopril 5 mg daily , Toprol-XL 25
mg daily , MiraLax 17 grams p.o. daily p.r.n. constipation ,
Seroquel 25 mg p.o. bedtime p.r.n. for agitation , Zocor 20 mg
daily , and thiamine 100 mg daily.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
1. Follow up blood pressure and titrate medications as needed.
2. Optimize medical management of CAD , diagnostic results showed
3-vessel CAD , with patent grafts , proximal LAD and two diagonals
are not bypassed. Decision is for medical management. If the
patient continues to experience symptoms , further consideration
for a repeat cardiac catheterization and PCI if necessary.
3. The patient was complaining of chronic blurry vision which he
had prior to this hospitalization; we recommend further follow up
with ophthalmology as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA: BUN 31 , creatinine 1.1 , sodium 139 ,
potassium 4.4 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 25. LFTs within normal
limits. Calcium 9.7 , magnesium 1.9. White blood cell count 6 ,
hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 212 , normal differential. INR 1.1.
