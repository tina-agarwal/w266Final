Discharge Date: 6/28/2007
ATTENDING: BOLINGER , TERRENCE M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis responsible for causing the
admission is rheumatoid arthritis flare.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old female
with a history of rheumatoid and gouty arthritis ,
insulin-dependent diabetes , hypertension , sickle cell trait and
chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ). For her
rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , she had been long treated with
methotrexate and allopurinol. In 0/17 , due to worsening renal
insufficiency , her methotrexate was discontinued. Following
this , she was seen by her rheumatologist with complaints of
worsening joint pains and body aches , for which she was started
on Plaquenil on 0/20/07 . On 1/17/07 , she presented to the
Ry And Hospital Emergency Department complaining of
total body pain. In particular , she said that her left groin was
very painful , although when asked , she said that every joint and
muscle group was causing discomfort. She denied fevers , chills ,
loose stools , urinary symptoms , nausea , vomiting or other
constitutional symptoms aside from a headache on the day of
admission. Her pain especially in her hip was so severe at the
time of admission that she felt that she was not able to walk.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Rheumatoid and gouty arthritis: Previously on methotrexate
and allopurinol , but due to worsening renal insufficiency ,
methotrexate was stopped in 0/17 , and Plaquenil was started in
11/6 . 
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes.
3. Hypertension.
4. Sickle cell trait.
5. Multinodular goiter.
6. Status post CVA , with mild residual right hemiparesis.
7. Chronic kidney disease , baseline creatinine of 1.9 ( ?of
whether this is due to renal tubular acidosis or diabetes ).
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. NPH.
2. Plaquenil 200 mg b.i.d.
3. Allopurinol 100 mg daily.
4. Lisinopril 40 mg daily.
5. Paxil.
6. Hydralazine 50 mg q.i.d.
7. Toprol 50 mg daily.
8. Aspirin 81 mg.
9. Imdur 30 mg.
10. Prilosec 20 mg ,
11. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day.
12. Calcitriol 0.25 mg b.i.d.
13. Lipitor 20 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES: To metoclopramide , which causes dystonia.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has prior tobacco history.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her mom passed away at age 79 and had coronary
artery disease and diabetes. Her father passed away at the age
of 66 from an aneurysm.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Her temperature was 97.7 ,
pulse of 93 , respirations 16 , blood pressure 151/69 , satting 99%
on room air. In general , she was awake , alert , oriented ,
conversant , but in pain. HEENT: Extraocular muscles were
intact , mucous membranes are moist , neck was supple , JVP was not
noticeably elevated. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft ,
diffusely tender especially in the left and right lower
quadrants , with a question of rebound in these distributions as
well. Extremities: Warm and well perfused , no
cyanosis/clubbing/edema. Extremities: Exquisite tenderness to
palpation over the left hip ( due to severe pain , the patient
could not be positioned in lateral decubitus position to
accurately assess for bursal pain ) , positive left hip pain on
internal and external rotation of the hip , and positive left
elbow pain , along with pain in multiple other areas , without
obvious erythema , effusion , warmth or trauma.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION: Her sodium was 130 , potassium
of 4.1 , chloride of 99 , bicarb of 22 , BUN of 78 , creatinine of
2.3 ( baseline creatinine 1.9-2.5 ) , glucose of 227. Her white
count was 11.8 , hematocrit of 26.9 ( baseline hematocrit of
29-30 ) , platelets of 378 , 000. Her ALT was 12 , AST was 12 ,
alkaline phosphatase of 98 , total bilirubin 0.2 , albumin was 3.1
and globulin was 4.2. Her ESR was 103 , CRP was 151.
OTHER PERTINENT LABS DURING THE COURSE OF HER HOSPITALIZATION:
Her initial urine sodium was 34 , urine creatinine 58.2 , urine BUN
555; urine eosinophils negative; urinalysis showed 2+ protein , 23
white cells , 1 red blood cell , 1+ bacteria and 2+ squamous cells.
On 1/17/07 , urine cultures and blood cultures negative;
9/12/07 urine culture positive for MRSA , sensitive to Bactrim.
On 0/20/07 , left hip washing and aspiration Gram-stain negative
and culture negative. On 0/20/07 , C. difficile negative.
HER RELEVANT STUDIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: On 1/17/07 , pelvic and hip
x-rays demonstrated right hip rheumatoid arthritis , narrowing of
the right SI joint; no acute abnormality or effusion in the left
hip. On 1/17/07 , lower extremity noninvasive studies negative.
On 1/17/07 , KUB showing gastric antral gas. On 1/17/07
abdominal CAT scan notable for bilateral peri renal straining
( old ) , mesenteric stranding ( old ) , left phlebolith. On 0/20/07
echocardiogram , EF of 60% , concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 38 plus
right atrial pressure , trace effusion.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 65-year-old female with a history of
rheumatoid and gouty arthritis , diabetes , sickle cell trait and
chronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ) , admitted for
diffuse body aches and pains , most likely attributable to a
rheumatoid arthritis flare.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Body aches and joint pains: The differential diagnosis for
the patient's body aches and joint pains initially included a
rheumatoid arthritis flare , septic joint , crystal joint disease ,
intra-abdominal process or Plaquenil reaction. Her abdominal CAT
scan showed stable peri-renal standing and mesenteric stranding.
Her creatinine kinase was normal. Her urine culture from the
second day of hospitalization was notable for MRSA. A left hip
aspiration was attempted by Interventional Radiology; no fluid
was obtainable , so a washing followed by drainage was performed ,
which had a negative Gram-stain and negative cultures.
Similarly , blood cultures were negative , and an echocardiogram
revealed no evidence of endocarditis as an explanation for her
MRSA urinary tract infection. By process of elimination ,
therefore , the etiology of her body aches and joint pains was
therefore thought to be rheumatoid arthritis flare , although of
note , her ESR and CRP were a bit higher than would be expected
for a rheumatoid arthritis flare. She was seen by the
Rheumatology Consult Service , who stated that the Plaquenil would
take a few weeks to exert its effect. As a result , she was
started on prednisone and uptitrated per symptoms. In addition ,
she was started on leflunomide. Initially , there were plans to
start Enbrel , and a PPD placed was negative; however , due to her
concomitant MRSA urinary tract infection , such plans have been
deferred to the outpatient setting.
2. MRSA urinary tract infection: As discussed above , her urine
culture day after admission was notable for MRSA , sensitive to
Bactrim. Due to hip pain and one mild fever to the range of
100.6-100.9 with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 11 to
15 , Interventional Radiology did a hip wash and aspirate that was
negative , as well as a transthoracic echo that was negative for
evidence of endocarditis. Surveillance blood cultures similarly
were negative. She was started on vancomycin , with plans to
change to Bactrim upon discharge.
3. Pain control: The patient was on standing and p.r.n.
Dilaudid , along with OxyContin t.i.d. , the latter of which she
refused due to nausea. She was , therefore , started on a fentanyl
patch with standing and p.r.n. Dilaudid. She did well on this
standing and p.r.n. Dilaudid. As of discharge , she has done well
on this regimen.
4. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive with systolic
blood pressures in the range of 170s at multiple times during her
hospitalization. This is partly from pain , and partly from poor
control of her central hypertension. She was maintained on
Toprol , Imdur , hydralazine and amlodipine , which were titrated
for a maximum effect. Because of refractory hypertension , we
recommend that she undergo renal artery imaging as an outpatient.
5. Diabetes: The patient was started on NPH , short-acting
prandial insulin and a sliding scale , all of which were up
titrated while she was inhouse.
6. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient had acute
on chronic renal insufficiency ( creatinine on admission 2.3 ,
baseline of 1.9 ). This was thought to be predominantly prerenal.
Through her hospitalization , her creatinine gradually decreased
to her baseline of 1.9.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: A separate dictation for medication
list will be supplied when the patient is ready for discharge.
