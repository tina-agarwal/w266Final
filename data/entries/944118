BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: lethargy , unsteady gait -- readmission after
similar symptoms Wed .
HPI:60M w/ newly-diagnosed DM , hyperlipidemia , glaucoma , h/o EtOH
abuse , and erectile dysfunction presents to ED for 2nd time in 3 days
w/ unsteadiness and sleepiness. He was admitted 8/4/06 with similar
sleepiness and poor hand coordination and trouble driving , was brought
to ED somnolent and found to have BS 200-300. Workup including head
CTA , MR were negative and patient d/c'ed Thursday night w/ metformin and
plans for Holter and TTE on Monday. Patient felt great until Friday
morning when noted to have unsteadiness and sleepiness , similar but less
severe than Wed. Returned to ED with BS 277. No fevers , headaches , focal
neuro findings , vertigo , visual changes , CP , SOB , n/v , abd pain ,
dysuria , joint pain. Reported small rash on penis for which was taking
acyclovir this week but stopped Wed for possible neuro side effects.
Admit labs significant for glucose 314 , elevated lipids ( Chol 302 , Trig
323 , LDL 189 ) , otherwise normal , negative cardiac enzymes. Urine toxin
screen was negative. CBC normal except for MCV 78 with normal iron
studies and normal RBC mass. HbA1c was 11.1%. EKG had old j-point
elevation laterally , otherwise NSR without LVH or LAE. Physical and neuro
exam normal. MRI/MRA and CTA were unremarkable in 1st admission 2 days
prior and so were not repeated. Patient was stable overnight and felt
great on Saturday 0/11/06 morning. No abnormal events were recorded on
telemetry overnight and after patient was walked around the floor.
Patient sugars were managed o/n with sliding scale insulin and diabetic
low-fat house diet , and blood sugar in morning responded down to 185.
.
Explanations for episodes considered were TIA of posterior circulation
vs. seizure , less likely atypical migraine or sleep disorder -- see admit
notes for discussion.
.
At time of discharge , patient was stable and feeling very good , eager to
leave for an afternoon function and preferred not to stay for further
workup. He will followup with Dr. Clesen on Monday. He will be evaluated
this week with TTE with bubble-study to r/o intracardiac source or PFO.
Would also consider EEG if Neurology deems possibility of seizure. In the
meantime , added low-dose glyburide to metformin to manage hyperglycemia
at home , with more strips to monitor blood sugars 3-4x / day. Have also
increased aspirin dose from 81 mg to 325 mg qd. Patient was also given
prescription for automatic BP cuff for monitoring at home.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: To better manage your blood sugars , added glyburide which you should take
once a day in addition to metformin twice a day. Continue to check your
blood sugars 3-4 times per day. You can also obtain an automatic BP cuff
for monitoring at home. If episode recurs , do not drive , check
sugars and BP , drink fluids , contact MD or return to ED as soon as
possible.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
f/u with Dr. Wantuck on February , that week should have TTE with bubble
study to evaluate heart , EEG to r/o seizure , titer hyperglycemia meds
