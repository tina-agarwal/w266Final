ATTENDING: ROD GLEMBOCKI MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Right ankle fusion.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Status post right ankle fusion and
pneumonia.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Cleared history of heart transplant ,
history of rheumatic fever , diabetes mellitus type 1 ,
gastroesophageal reflux disease , chronic renal insufficiency , and
osteoporosis.
HISTORY: The patient is a 65-year-old woman with history of
rheumatic heart disease and endocarditis ultimately requiring
heart transplant in November of 1993 , diabetes mellitus type #1 ,
and chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.8.
He was admitted on February , 2003 , for elective right ankle
fusion. About 1 year prior to admission , she fell down stairs
and had a right pilon fracture initially treated with cast
immobilization. The patient noted persistent right lower leg and
ankle deformity and daily aching pain and decided with her
orthopedic surgeon to have an elective right ankle fusion. After
surgery , her vitals were 100.3 , 111 , respiratory rate of 18 ,
oxygen saturation of 98% upon 70% face mask. Exam was notable
for decreased breath sounds with wheezing with a positive S4.
JVP was difficult to assess. Extremities were warm with pitting
edema. Labs were notable for cyclosporin levels 133. EKG showed
no significant change consistent with November , 2003. She was
started on IV Lasix diuresis for proper fluid overload , as she
had received 4 L intraoperatively. She developed low-grade fever
and then up to 102 , and had left calf pain on palpation. A
spiral CT was sent that was negative for PE , DVT , or CHF , but
positive for atelectasis. The BUN to creatinine ratio trended
upwards up to 31/2.3 from 29/1.7 on admission and then she was
transferred to cardiology 3 for management of hypoxia , fever ,
acute and chronic renal failure , and developing hypertension to
the 90s , systolic from a baseline of 105. She was transferred to
cardiology on March , 2003. Her vitals on transfer were T
max 100.4 to current 99.2 , pulse 99 to 108 , currently 99 , blood
pressure was ranging to 90 to 102 over doppler to 60.
Respiratory rate of 18 , 97% on high flow of 100% oxygen. On
physical exam , she had bibasilar inspiratory crackles , left
greater than right and tachycardia around 100. Extremities were
warm with trace edema in the left lower extremity. Her labs at
that time were notable for white count of only 6.5. Creatinine
of 4.1 from 2.3 , and BUN of 41. She had a portable chest x-ray
that showed cardiomegaly and bilateral atelectasis with focal
opacity at the left lung base. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm
with 97 beats per minute. No ST changes , Q wave inversions in V1
and V3 , with RSR prime pattern. V1 that showed RS duration of 80
milliseconds , not significantly changed from February , 2003.
Echocardiogram on March , 2003 , had shown an ejection
fraction of 50% to 55% with mild left ventricular enlargement and
preserved systolic function , mild posterior and lateral
hypokinesis , normal right ventricular size and function , mitral
valves mildly thickened with mild MR. Stress echocardiogram on
February 2003 , showed no inducible ischemia. There was a
dobutamine protocol. Right heart cath in February of 2003 ,
showed a right atrial pressure of 21 , PCWP is 28. This time , she
was started on Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d , The labs were negative for
rejection.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As noted above , rheumatic heart disease
status post heart transplant in 1993 , diabetes mellitus type 1 ,
GERD , chronic renal insufficiency , baseline creatinine of 1.8.
In 1985 , had septic stroke with brain abscess postoperative
status post MVR. History of MRSA , osteoporosis. Status post
cholecystectomy.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: Mag oxide , Tums p.r.n. , Niferex ,
Lexapro , multivitamin , Colace , Nexium , Lasix , Cyclosporin ,
prednisone , Imuran , Cozaar , Cardizem , aspirin , Nephrox ,
Pravachol , Fosamax , NPH 60 units q.a.m. 10 units q.p.m.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin causes rash , codeine causes severe nausea
and vomiting.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Quit smoking in 1978 , rare alcohol , no IV drug
use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , vitals were notable for
oxygen saturation in the 84% range on room air and tachycardia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Musculoskeletal: The operation was without complications with
minimal bleeding. She had a right leg cast placed after the
procedure. She has been followed by the orthopedic surgery team
initially on their service and then as a consulting team , once
she was transferred to medicine. She was able to move her toes
with the splint in place and there were no orthopedic
complications from the procedure. She will follow up with Dr.
Rutecki on January , 2003. She also worked with physical
therapy to peripheral functional status and will need physical
therapy as an outpatient 3 to 5 times per week. Her motion is
limited by decreased strength in the upper extremities , which
prevents her from performing NWB gait.
Cardiovascular: Initially it was difficult to assess whether she
was volume overloaded or euvolemic given the hypotension , but
elevated right heart filling pressure before the admission and a
chest x-ray that also revealed fluid in the fissure on the right.
She had poor urine output as well so she was given Lasix 120 mg
IV b.i.d. , to which she did not respond and the Lasix drip was
started. She was transferred to the CCU for possible sepsis
because her blood pressure continued to drop to the 60 and 70
systolic and required Dopamine IV. Once she was transferred to
the CCU , a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , which revealed SVR of
689 , and cardiac output of 5.8 consistent with sepsis. The right
heart filling pressures were high also. She was continued on IV
Lasix with good urine output response in the MICU and then was
subsequently transferred back to the cardiac team when her
hemodynamic status was improved. For ischemia , she was given
aspirin and her home Pravachol for her ischemic risk factors
including diabetes and high cholesterol. When she returned to
the floor , her diuresis remained good off the Lasix , possibly
related to post ATN diuresis and her ins and outs remained
negative. She was given her home prednisone 5 mg q.d. as well as
her home cyclosporin. She was also continued on Imuran.
Infectious Disease. Given the chest x-ray findings , she was
treated for pneumonia initially with broad covers with
vancomycin , azithromycin , and levofloxacin. All the blood and
urine cultures were negative. The workup for her infection was
negative and was presumed that she had community-acquired
pneumonia , and it responded well to levofloxacin 10-day course.
The vancomycin was discontinued in the MICU and the Ceptaz was
continued when she was transferred back the floor. On physical
exam on the day of discharge was improved with only faint
inspiratory crackles at the right base. She had two MRSA nares
cultures that were negative and a third one was pending on the
day of discharge. Stool cultures were sent that were negative as
well as sputum Gram stain and culture that was negative.
Renal: In the postoperative course , her creatinine rose
dramatically to the 5 range , also the possible etiology was
multifactorial including dye load with the CT , spiral , as well as
history of chronic renal insufficiency likely from diabetes and
chronic cyclosporin use. She was seen by renal consult and
during the course of the MICU stay , her renal function improved
dramatically back to the baseline and in the interim , she was
given Sevelamer for high phosphorus , but it was discontinued when
the phosphorus level came back normal.
Gastrointestinal: She was continued on Nexium , Lactulose , and
did not report any GI discomfort.
Hematology: She was given subcu heparin for prophylaxis and
Niferex.
Endocrine: During the period of hypotension , she was given test
dose steroids with hydrocortisone , and she responded well to this
and when she returned to the cardiology floor , her hydrocortisone
was tapered and she was then placed back on her home prednisone.
She was continued on her home NPH 60 units in the morning and 10
units at night. She did develop some hypoglycemic episodes that
were asymptomatic , the lowest glucose was 37 , so the evening dose
of NPH was reduced to 4 units. She was also covered with insulin
sliding scale while on steroids.
Respiratory: She was breathing comfortably on room on the day of
discharge.
Neurology: She did have some waxing and waning of her mental
status during the setting of hypotension and fever , although she
had a baseline slowed response to questioning. She was markedly
slower to respond to questioning but normally oriented to place
and person. By the time she was discharged she was back to her
baseline mental status as confirmed by her husband at bedside.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Imuran 15 mg
p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Heparin 5000 units subcu
b.i.d. , NPH human insulin 60 units subcu q.a.m. NPH human insulin

and h.s. , Lactulose 30 mg p.o. q.d. , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Nystatin cream topical b.i.d. , prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
Pravachol 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , cyclosporin 15 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Diltiazem Extended Release 300 mg p.o. q.d. , Miconazole Nitrate
2% topical b.i.d. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Magnesium oxide 400 mg
p.o. q.d. , Combivent 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d. , p.r.n. shortness of
breath , Lexapro 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Fosamax 70 mg p.o. q. week.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient will follow up with
orthopedics Dr. Hodnett on January , 2003. Physical therapy
needs to work with the patient 3 to 5 times a week to improve her
mobility and functional status as per physical therapy
recommendations during her stay here. Please call Lecer Nigein Sotarnock University Medical Center or look in the medical records to see what her third MRSA
culture report is for nares culture , if it is negative , then she
has had 3 negative MRSA cultures and does not need to be in MRSA
precautions any longer.
She needs to follow up with the heart transplant service in 2 to
4 weeks at Pen Broadl Memorial Hospital .
