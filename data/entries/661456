ECHO 1/19/07 : Nl EF 60%. no wma.no evidence chamber enlargement.
CARDIAC PET ( rest/stress w persantine ):Image quality was excellent. The
images demonstrated normal LV size. They also demonstrated normal RV size
with normal RV tracer uptake at rest. There were no regional perfusion
defects seen on the stress or rest images. On Gated PET:
Rest LV ejection fraction of 53% and ESVI 29 ml/m^2. The post-stress LV
ejection fraction was 60% with ESVI 23 ml/m^2. The LV volumes appeared
normal. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities. Demonstrated
normal regional wall thickening. The RV function appeared normal.

Studies - ECG: NSR 75 LAD/LAFB. poor RWP. currently TWI in

.
Impression: 62F CAD/CABG , dCHF admitted after presented with chest
pressure and worsening of chronic cough with low grade fever. Likely
combo of URI-triggered asthma cough , gastroenteritis , and ?CHF. unlikely
UA.
Plan:
- Chest pain ( I ): CAD s/p CABG , DM. High risk w/ inc SOB. Not
convincing for unstable angina but having progressive SOB. ECG
changes nonspecific , not concerning as noted on multiple prior EKG's.
Cont ASA , BB , ARB , statin. Noted to be hypertensive during hospital stay
with SBP's in 130-160. HR 60-80s. Will discharge on increased dose of
atenolol ( 100 mg daily instead of 75 mg daily. )
( P ): Repeat echo for progressive SOB. ddCHF. Preserved EF. No wall motion
abnormalities or changes suggestive of worsening systolic/diastolic
function or ischemia. Discharge on home lasix with standing potassium
supplementation.
( R ): Sinus rhythm. No events on telemetry. T waves in V1-V2 originally
noted varied from flat to slightly negative. No other dynamic changes.
.
COUGH: Patient gives a history of chronic cough that has recently
involved sputum production and low grade fever. Her symptoms are
consistent with a viral bronchitis with some reactive airway disease.
She got relief from duoneb and was discharged with a new albuterol
inhaler. She will also be treated with an empiric course of protonix to
treat reflux which may exacerbate reactive airway disease or in itself
cause night time cough. There was no evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
-Sputum gram stain and culture pending at discharge.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were admitted with concerning changes on your EKG and chest pressure.
Numerous studies were performed and show that your heart gets adequate
blood flow during rest and exercise. You did not have any evidence of
heart attack either. Your cough and chest discomfort are most likely due
to an upper respiratory tract infection. This may also make your asthma
worse. We would recommend using your asthma inhaler during the day for
cough and wheeze. Also we would recommend trying a low dose of stomach
acid reducer ( protonix ) as acid reflux can also make cough worse.
.
KEY MEDICATION CHANGES:
Continue all medicines that you were taking before with the following
changes:
1. Atenolol. Take 100 mg daily ( increase from 75 mg daily. ) You were
noted to have high blood pressure even on your current dose.
2. Prilosec. Take as directed for 2 weeks. This may help your chronic
cough.
3. Albuterol inhaler ( Ventolin. ) Please take as directed.
4. Robitussion , sugar free. Take as directed for cough.
.
Please return to your doctor to check in on how you are doing in the next
2 weeks. Return to the ER if you are having difficulty breathing ,
recurrent chest pain , or other concerning symptoms.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Followup sputum gram stain/culture.
2. Blood pressure check on increased dose atenolol.
3. Cough: improved on albuterol inhaler and proton-pump inhibitor?
