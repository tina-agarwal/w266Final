precordial pain , which progressed to substernal chest pressure
radiating to the neck down her right arm and left arm and a
feeling of left arm numbness. The patient did experience
significant nausea and vomiting and took multiple nitroglycerins
without relief. She presented to Daley Oer's Memorial Hospital Emergency
Room , was noted to have ST depressions in the inferolateral leads
as well as T-wave inversions in her lateral leads. Troponin at
that time was 14. The patient was admitted for non-ST elevation

99% on room air. General , this is a pleasant elderly female in
no acute distress , slightly slurred speech. HEENT , normocephalic
and atraumatic. Extraocular motions are intact. Neck is supple.
No lymphadenopathy , no thyroid enlargement , bilateral carotid
bruits palpable. Cardiovascular , distant heart sounds , regular
rate and rhythm , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left
sternal base. No rubs or gallops. Crackles heavily at the chest
wall , no wheezes. Abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended.
Bowel sounds are present. Extremities , no clubbing or cyanosis.
Pedal pulses , 1+ , left greater than right. Neuro , cranial nerves
II through XII intact. Strength 5/5 diffusely , light touch
intact throughout , no dysmetria , mild difficulty with alternating
movements , and negative pronator drift.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs upon admission included ??__?? creatinine
of 3.1 , otherwise the electrolytes within normal limits , sodium
129 , and glucose 132. LFTs were within normal limits. Hemogram
showed a mildly depressed hematocrit of 32 , troponin elevated at
14.4 , CK 364 , and CKMB 28.3. EKG upon admission showed normal
sinus rhythm at 83 , normal axis , ST depressions noted in leads II
V5 , and V6. No ST elevations. Q waves in III and F. T wave
inversions noted in I through III , F , V6 , poor R-wave
progression.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 61-year-old female with a history
of multiple vasculopathies , who presented with a non-ST elevation
MI. The patient was noted to have markedly elevated troponin and
progressive T-wave inversions laterally.
1. Cardiovascular ischemia , following admission , the patient was
initiated on aspirin , Plavix , nitroglycerin drip , oxygen p.r.n. ,
and the beta-blocker was titrated up as tolerated. ACE inhibitor
as well as hydralazine were held. Over the first night of
admission , the patient noted increasing chest discomfort. The
nitroglycerin was titrated up. EKG showed continued T wave
inversions laterally as well as marked increase in troponin up to
an elevation of 105. Cardiac fellow was contacted and the
patient was titrated up further on her nitroglycerin to a max of
200. The patient did not have chest pain on the night of
admission , however was noted to have EKG changes and elevated
troponin as mentioned. On the morning following admission , on
11/16/05 , the patient was noted to have new onset of chest
discomfort and at that time was noted to have ST elevations in
her inferior leads III and F as well as V6 and L. At that time ,
due to the continued chest discomfort and new ST elevation , the
patient was taken to the cath lab , at which time , she underwent a
cardiac catheterization and was noted to have a three-vessel
disease status post CABG. She was noted to have 90% of occlusion
of the SVG graft to RTPDA status post PDA. These lesions were
intervened upon with drug eluding stents x 3. Following the
catheterization , the patient was continued on her medical
management. She remained chest pain free and the nitroglycerin
drip was discontinued. Following the cath , the patient's
troponins trended down and she had mild ST elevations that
persisted inferiorly but were diminished prior to discharge.
Preventive measures including nutrition and smoking sensation
were obtained. The patient appears reluctant to quit smoking.
Cardiovascular pump , the patient has a history of hypertension ,
which was well controlled throughout her hospitalization.
Isordil and hydralazine were initially held on admission while on
the nitroglycerin drip. The ACE inhibitor was held secondary to
acute renal insufficiency. Therefore , the beta-blocker was
titrated up. Upon discharge , the patient may reinitiate on
low-dose hydralazine and Isordil as well as reinitiation of the
ACE as tolerated with renal function. In addition , the patient
has a history of diastolic dysfunction , which is likely due to
her history of hypertension. An echocardiogram from March 2005
during a prior admission for heat failure showed an EF of 60% , as
well as inferior apical hypokinesis , mild elevated LVEDP. The
patient appeared mildly hypervolemic during her hospitalization
but did not show any signs of acute congestive heart failure.
Initially diuresis was held secondary to acute renal
insufficiency. However , she received Lasix 40 mg IV x1 on
10/30/05 due to abdominal discomfort and distention due to mild
volume overload. Cardiovascular rhythm , the patient was
continued on telemetry throughout her hospitalization. She has
no history of arrhythmias and no events were noted on her
telemetry. She obtained EKGs , which showed no significant change
or nodal blockage.
2. Endocrine , the patient has a history of insulin-dependent
diabetes , which was moderately well controlled throughout her
hospitalization. She has a history of hemoglobin A1c of 7.3 as
of February 2005. Upon admission , glyburide was held and the
patient was continued on Lantus as well as a sliding scale of
Regular Insulin. She obtained fingers sticks a.c. and h.s.
Glipizide was initiated on 10/30/05 and will be titrated up as
tolerated as an outpatient.
3. Respiratory , this system was stable throughout admission.
The patient had crackles on exam , but no significant pulmonary
edema on chest x-ray. Abdominal CT on 6/13/05 was notable for
moderate right and trace left pleural effusions. The patient
maintained excellent pulse oximetry on room air without any
respiratory compromise.
4. Renal , upon admission , the patient was noted to have acute
renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 3.2. The patient has a
history of chronic renal insufficiency secondary to hypertensive
nephropathy , diabetic nephropathy , and likely renal artery
stenosis. Prior renal ultrasound showed an atrophic left kidney
with mild decrease in perfusion. Following admission , the
patient was initiated on D5W with 3 ampules of bicarb as well as
Mucomyst in preparation for likely cardiac catheterization. She
was continued on IV fluids following the catheterization.
Despite these preventive measures , the patient had a marked
increase in her creatinine following cardiac cath with a high
creatinine of 5 on 9/24/05 . Renal consult was obtained and
advised continued treatment. A urine sediment was obtained which
was consistent with ATN. An abdominal CT showed evidence again
of an atrophic left kidney. Creatinine was noted to begin to
decrease on 6/13/05 and was 4.2 the day before discharge. The
patient will follow up with Dr. Lamantia in Nephrology within three
months' time.
5. GI , the patient was noted to have right upper quadrant
abdominal pain on 9/24/05 . She had had mild elevations in her
LFTs , most notably an alk phos of 293. However , these values
stabilized throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. An
abdominal CT was obtained without contrast that showed no sign of
obstruction , hepatobiliary disease , but was notable for a ventral
hernia that was not strangulated or incarcerated. The patient
continued to pass and had regular bowel movements. She was
continued on bowel regimen. The pain was thought to be likely
secondary to ventral hernia with increased volume status.
Therefore , she was given a mild diuresis to decrease volume
overload.
6. ID was stable.
7. Heme , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop prior
to cath. She dropped from 32 to 26. She was transfused two
units of packed red blood cells prior to catheterization in order
to keep the hematocrit greater than 30. There was no acute
source of blood loss noted. Guaiac stools were negative. There
is likely a component of anemia of chronic disease secondary to
chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's hematocrit continued
to trend down and on 6/13/05 , an abdominal CT was obtained to
rule out retroperitoneal bleed , which was negative. The patient
was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on 6/13/05 .
She will likely require a further anemia workup as an outpatient.
8. FEN , the patient was not given any electrolyte scales
secondary to her acute renal insufficiency. She was noted to
have hyponatremia with a lowest of 123 and was therefore placed
on free water 1.5-liter restriction with adequate resolution.
The patient was also placed on a less than 2-gm salt restriction
to decrease volume overload. She was noted to have an increased
phosphorous level and was started on PhosLo. She had elevated
potassiums , but this did not exceed 5. The patient was continued
on a cardiac/renal 1800 ADA diet. Prophylaxis included SCD and
Pneumoboots in the setting of anemia. She was continued on a
proton pump inhibitor.
CODE: The patient is DNR/DNI.
DISPOSITION: Upon discharge , the patient was in stable condition
and will be discharged home without service. She was able to
ambulate without chest pain or shortness of breath tolerating
p.o. intake well. She will have follow-up as noted in the
addendum. The patient was instructed not to smoke and to take
daily weights and if she gained more than 2 pounds per day or 5
pounds in a week , she was instructed to call her doctor. She
should seek medical attention for worsening shortness of breath ,
chest pain , weight gain , dizziness , worsening abdominal pain , or
any other concerns.
PLAN:
1. Follow up with Dr. Chesebro , monitor for continued decrease in
creatinine. Consider reinitiating the ACE inhibitor with
resolution of acute renal insufficiency. Titrate the
beta-blocker and restart nitrates as tolerated. Titrate up
glipizide as needed. Consider further anemia workup. Encourage
smoking sensation. Continue to monitor abdominal pain/LFTs and
consider further evaluation of ventral hernia. Check LFTs with
recent addition of Lipitor.
2. Follow up with Dr. Burkle post MI management.
3. Follow up with Dr. Bottrell for management of chronic renal
insufficiency.
