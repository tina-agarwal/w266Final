BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Notari was admitted to the Orthopaedic Hand Service on 1/18/2006
w/ a history of increased R shoulder pain following a cellulitis of
the right hand. An ESR was checked on admission and was slightly
elevated at 18. He was afebrile and non-toxic , therefore was not started
on antibiotics. Dilaudid was added to his pain regimen for his increased
discomfort.
On 9/25/2006 a CT guided R shoulder joint fluid aspiration was performed
by Radiology. Analysis of this fluid was not consistant with joint
infection.
He received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis during his admission. On HD#4 he
was awake , alert , appropriate and afebrile with stable vitals signs. His
pain was well controlled on oral medications. He was discharged to home
and instructed to follow up with Dr. Rumler at his previously scheduled
appointment on 4/13/2006. His final joint fluid cultures were pending at
the time of discharge , he will be contacted at home if these turn
positivie.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Do pendulum range of motion exercises regularly. This is very
important in maintaining full range of motion. You should not add any
additional exercises until cleared to do so by Dr. Stupka
2. You have been given a prescription for a narcotic for pain control. Do
not drive a motor vehicle , drink any alcohol or operate machinery while
taking this medication. As your pain allows , you should reduce the amount
of this medication accordingly. Narcotic pain medications can cause
constipation , so you should drink plenty of water and take a stool
softener ( Colace ) to help prevent this side effect.
3. Call Dr. Camelo at the number above , or your Primary Care Physician , or
go to a local emergency room if you develop fevers/chills , redness around
your incision that is warm to the touch , pus-like drainage from the
wound , loss of function ( either strength or sensation ) in your hand ,
return to your original symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath or any
other concerning symptoms.
4. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by Dr. Boys
5. Resume home medications unless specifically instructed otherwise.
