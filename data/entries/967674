165/81 , respiratory rate 26 , satting 93-94%
on room air. GENERAL: No acute distress. HEENT: PERRLA. NECK:
JVP to the angle of the jaw. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles. HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , positive S3 , II-III/VI
holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border
radiating to the apex. ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended ,
with positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Minimal edema , 2+
pitting edema , sacral pitting edema , no calf tenderness.
LABORATORY DATA: Na 140 , K 3.6 , Cl 102 , bicarb 27 , BUN 37 ,
creatinine 2.3 , baseline 1.8-2.1 , glucose 116.
CK 73 , Ca 9.3 , troponin 0.13. White blood cell count 8.98 ,
hematocrit 32.2 , platelets 333. Urine - 3+ protein , trace glucose.
Previous echocardiogram shows normal size and function. EF 60% ,
basal inferior hypokinesis , normal size and function , 2-3+ MR , with
mild eczematous dysfunction of valve , and mild left atrial
enlargement. ETT was done in 10/6 .  The patient went for four
minutes , heart rate 76 , BP 125/70. Her EKG showed evidence of
ischemia. Imaging report not on the computer.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was diuresed aggressively. On
2/12 , added clonidine and changed captopril
to ramipril for better long-acting blood pressure control for blood
pressures in the 190-200 range.
On 6/1 , increased Lasix and clonidine for improved diuresis
and blood pressure control , hyperproliferative normocytic anemia ,
begin erythropoietin , however erythropoietin level of 15 signifies
some erythropoietin production. Chest x-ray showed continued
pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. Sputum gram stain with 4+
polys , gram positive in clusters and chains , and a culture with 1+
oral flora.
On 1/28 , continued to diuresis patient well.
On 10/29 , creatinine 2.6 , discontinued Norvasc and clonidine.
On 10/16 , creatinine 3.0 , held the diuresis , discontinued ACE
inhibitor and ARD. MRI of the kidneys showed no evidence of renal
artery stenosis. An echo done the same day showed mild MR with an
EF of 45-50%. Dr. Galathe recommended holding all blood pressure
meds. Team also held all diuretics.
On 3/24 , creatinine to 4.0 , urine output only 450 cc in 24
hours despite a bolus of 500 cc.
On 10/14 , changed atenolol to metoprolol for a better renal
clearance. Discontinued Tiazac. Renal failure at the time was
thought to be secondary most likely to prerenal from hypotension
and hypovolemia. This patient was orthostatic , which lead to renal
acute tubular necrosis. The patient had casts in urine. Continued
to have nausea and was put on Compazine , Zofran , and Prilosec.
High protein and creatinine ratio. The patient had a continued
cough , low grade fever , and a white count. Chest x-ray showed no
evidence of infiltrates. Started levofloxacin for presumed URI.
She had a temperature spike to 101.5. She underwent fractional
excretion of sodium 0.61 , protein 4681 , creatinine 75.7 , osmolality
339. UA was bland. No eosinophils were seen. Albumin 3.8.
On 0/27 , BUN and creatinine was 109 and 6.8 , Na 124 , K 5.8. No
EKG changes were seen. The patient was administered Kayexalate
with subsequent drop in potassium. Magnesium and phosphate all
began to rise. The patient became oliguric and anuric , and
continued nausea and vomiting. The patient had more crackles , JVP ,
good sats. A 250 cc bolus of D5 1/2 normal saline was then
administered. Creatinine peaked to 7.2.
On 4/30 , the creatinine was back down to 6.4 without need for
dialysis intervention. Electrolytes were stable. The patient's
symptoms and exam improved. She continued better urine output.
The patient was transfused for a hematocrit of 28 with good
response.
On 4/27 , the creatinine was down to 4.4 , BUN 85. The patient
did feel much better , was diuresed six liters , and had clear lungs.
Increased the Lopressor to 37.5.
On 4/13 , the patient continued to diuresis after ATN recovery.
Lopressor was titrated up and ramipril was started after a
discussion with Dr. Lepore and Dr. Oligee .
On 4/23 , the patient was doing much better. Creatinine
improved. He continued to titrate up on Lopressor for a SBP of
130s. White blood cell count was mildly elevated to the 12 range.
UA and diff. were unremarkable. The patient is being discharged on
the following medications:
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Elavil 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.; aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d.; erythropoietin 5000 U subcu.
