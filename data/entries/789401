s/p pacer ( NOT AICD as originally thought ) , and HTN transferred from ASH
after 1 week of DOE--&gt;SOB at
rest. Baseline orthopnea/PND. At BSH , treated for volume
overload/bronchitis , BNP 363 , enzymes negative , flu negative s/p
levoflox x1. Became hypotensive in setting of diuresis , started on
dopa 5 and transferred to CGJMC for further management. In ED ,
dopa stopped with stable BPs in the low 100s , HR 110s , mentating and
urinating. Started on ASA/low dose BB for HR control , and continued
on ABX.

A/P: 81 yo M with MMP and extensive cardiac history p/w acute on
chronic DOE/SOB x1 week
1 ) CV ( P ) EF 10% and currently mildly overloaded. In NH , became
hypotensive to aggressive diuresis , diuresed gently here. BP stable off
pressors , watch with diuresis , added BB for rate control ( Toprol 50
QHS ).
( I ) no active ischemia. Added ASA/BB. Cont statin , lipids OK.
( R ) h/o afib not well rate controlled on admission. Added BB ( new ) and
added dig load. Interrogated pacer on 2/4 -&gt; rate has around 100.
2 ) PULM: SOB/DOE likely related to volume with possible concomitant
PNA/bronchitis. Cont levoflow while in house - felt was likely
bronchitis and levo was causing INR to increase , so d/c'ed at discharge.
3 ) GI: h/o GIB , likely why not on ASA in add'n to coumadin. Watch Hct
with low dose ASA. Stable. Nexium
4 ) GU: large inguinal hernia , nothing to do in this admission - eval by
primary cardiologist previously felt not surgical candidate. Cont
flomax.
5 ) ENDO: h/o DM , will start RISS. Checking TSH.
6 ) RENAL: baseline CRI ( unknown baseline creatinine ) but trending down in
house. Followed and remained stable at 1.8-2.0
7 ) RHEUM: gout on colchicine
8 ) HEME: on coumadin for afib , holding as
supratherapeutic. INR 5.5 at discharge , will continue and will have
rechecked in two days ( stopped levo which may have resulted in it
continuing to rise ). Hct stable
9 ) ID: on levoflox for presumed bronchitis. Will f/u c/x results from
MMHC . 
10 ) FEN: cardiac diet , scales
11 ) Ppx: INR &gt;2 , nexium
Lytes at discharge Na 139 , K 4.3 Cr 1.8 BUN 66 , INR 5.5 Hct 44 WBC 12 Plat

Ins at 595-693-5923 to adjust Coumadin ( should NOT
