ATTENDING: SIMKINS , WILFORD MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Chest pain/SOB.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , this is an 85-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , CRI , and prior
mitral valve replacement , and bioprosthesis presented with DE
compensated heart failure , increasing shortness of breath , and
chest pain. He has complex cardiovascular history and
progressive symptoms of heart failure. He had CABG in 1980 and
1990 and multiple PCI most recently in 5/13 with intervention on
SVG to the PDA. He had MVR in 1980 with bioprosthesis. He had
implantation of a CRT pacemaker with ICV function in 5/19 His
history of heart failure dates back ten years , but he has had
more marked decline over the past two years currently has SOB
typically , does not have orthopnea , PND , or leg edema. He has
been admitted to the Mid-lo Caldent Medical Center several times for
management of CHF in 6/1 After diuresis he states he could
walk up to 30 yards on a flat surface , but could not walk up
steps. He was at baseline until 5/18/05 when he had recurrent
episodes of chest pain respondive to sublingual nitroglycerin
associated with diaphoresis , nausea , palpitations , and
lightheadedness. On 9/29/05 , he had acute onset of shortness of
breath at rest after eating. He was admitted to the Ctr Medical Center and treated with diuresis and anticoagulation. MI was
excluded by serial enzymes. He was noted to be anemic. Other
lab values were consistent with hemolysis. As a part of his
workup , during ETT MIBI , he was able to walk 2 minutes 52 seconds
on the standard Bruce protocol , peak HR 94 , echo showed a dilated
LV , EF of 34% , mild global hypokinesis , and septal and apical
akinesis , enlarged dixed defect in the inferior apical wall with
moderate fixed defect in the inferior apical segment , and a small
amount of reversibility was noted in a mild inferior lateral
defect. Echocardiogram at CMC on 9/27 showed EF of 35% , septal
and apical akinesis , with normal RV function , mitral
bioprosthesis , mildly elevated antegrade velocities , mild
perivalvular regurgitation , moderate TR , moderate pulmonary
hypertension , SVP of 48 mmHg and PA plus RA pressure , transferred
for evaluation and management of chest pain at Slifarb Hospital with ? need for catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CHF , EF is 25% , atrial fibrillation ,
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 , mild
COPD , status post AAA repair in 1995 , BPH , TIA/CVA , anemia , on
home O2 , status post AICD , pacer , status post sinus arrest in
1993 , ischemic cardiomyopathy , CAD , status post mitral valve
replacement , porcine valve placed in 1980 , and status post CABG
x2. Please see HPI for further information.

FAMILY HISTORY: Alcohol: No history of abuse. He is retired
supervisor in water department. Family history is otherwise
noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: NAD , 60s to 70s , afebrile , and BP is 100
to 110 over 50 to 60. Saturating at 89% on two liters , 94% on
four liters , JVD 12 , mild HJR , bronchial breath sounds , dullness
at bases , and no rales. Cardiac is irregularly regular 2/6 mid
peaking SVM , and 2/6 HSM at apex. Abdomen: Benign. No HSM.
Extremities are warm without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: EKG underlying atrial fibrillation with
ventricular pacing at 70. Labs of note , hematocrit 27 , BUN 38 ,
creatinine 1.8 , sodium 140 , BNP brain natriuretic peptide 482 , CK
61 , troponin 0.1 , haptoglobin less than assay , reticulocyte count
6.2 , and LDH 679.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Cardiovascular: An 84-year-old man with complex medical issues
elderly and debilitated currently with last three to four heart
failures secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. He has undergone
multiples attempts of revascularization including CABG x2 ,
repeated PCI , most recently in 5/13 with intervention on SVG.
Revascularization options at this point are quite limited , the
amount of active ischemic burden suggested by his recent
submaximal MIBI ETT is unlikely to account for the severity of
the symptoms that he is experiencing. Unfortunately , his overall
debilitated state makes surgical intervention unlikely to be
tolerated. He was moderately overloaded at the time of arrival
and was aggressively diuresed. An echocardiogram was performed
on 11/11/05 , which showed moderate known perivalvular mitral
valve leakage and an EF of 30%. A right heart catheterization
was performed on 2/28/05 which showed RA pressure 7/7 , mean 5;
RV 52/1 , mean 4; PA 54/17 , mean 34; and PW 21/40 , mean 23. In
summary , overall dry after aggressive diuresis; however , with
large amounts of mitral regurgitation. For this reason , it was
discussed with the family possible clamping for his mitral valve
as he is not a candidate for mitral valve replacement given his
end-stage heart and generally frail state. Plan as of the time
of this dictation is to undergo TEE on 11/1/05 to evaluate
whether clamping of the mitral valve would be possible and then
to have mitral valve clamping later this week. The patient was
diuresed effectively with Lasix 200 mg IV b.i.d. with metolazone.
The patient was also started on digoxin and Aldactone. He had a
bump in his creatinine to 2.2 on 1/29/05 and then it continued
to rise and for this reason diuresis was held as of 0/10/05. As
for rhythm , paced , normal sinus rhythm , on telemetry. O 7/27/05
brief round of V-tach , paced out of it. An AICD and pacer in
place.
Pulmonary: COPD. On O2 at home , however , with increased
desaturation here in the hospital to mid 80s while walking ,
thought secondary to his extreme mitral valve regurgitation. On
Advair , Combivent , and albuterol nebulizer.
Renal: Elevated creatinine in mid 2s , baseline CRI creatinine
1.5 , and all medications were renally dosed.
FEN: Potassium and Magnesium scales , b.i.d electrolytes given
diuresis.
Heme: Hemolytic anemia with bilirubin of 3.0 likely secondary to
mitral valve regurgitation , not surgical candidate , baseline
unknown. Given transfusion on 6/29/05. Transfuse for
hematocrit less than 30. PTT goal of 60 to 80 on heparin. He
will eventually be put on Coumadin.
CODE: Code status was changed during the time of this admission
to DNR/DNI/no pressors.
This is an interval dictation , please see addendum for remaining
hospital course and for discharge medications.
