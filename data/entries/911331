BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is an 80 yo woman with a hx of CAD s/p MI in 1988 , 1991 , HTN
who presents with chest pain. She had prior MI , last in 1991 and since
then has been chest pain free. The day of admission , she had severe
retrosternal chest pain ( as she reports , similar to her prior angina
but not as severe ) and went to a local hospital. EKG and enzymes
negative , but CXR showed widened mediastinum. There was concern for
dissection , so she underwent CT which was read as positive for
dissection in ascending aorta. She was transferred to ISCH CCU for
further care. Repeat CT here showed no dissection but did show
extensive calficiations and luminal disease of the aorta. She was chest
pain free here until 5/24 AM when she had chest pain again with ST
depressions in V3-V6 at rest. She was made pain free with nitro and
heparin and transferred to the cardiology floor with presumed unstable
angina given her anginal pain , EKG ischemia changes , but lack of
elevated cardiac enzymes. Echo 1/6/03 demonstrated EF 65% with no
RWMA , no aortic root dissection , no effusion , and normal RV function.
1. CV: On 5/18/03 , cardiac catheterization was performed via radial
approach which revealed 3 vessel coronary disease with 90%
proximal LAD lesion followed by aneursymal segment and subsequent
90% lesion , diffuse non critical LAD disease distally , occluded
and collateralized D1 , occluded and collateralized OM2 , anterior
takeoff RCA with serial non-critical lesions and a mid 70% lesion.
The LAD was stented with a 18mm X 2.5mm Cypher stent with good
results. Patient will be continued on ASA , plavix , statin , metoprolol ,
and lisinopril will be started here ( nitrates will be discontinued ).
Integrillin was also give pericatheterization for 16 hours. Fasting
lipid profile on 8/7 revealed Triglycerides of 122 , HDL 28 ( low ) and
normal cholesterol ( 122 ) , CLDL , VLDL
2. Renal: Patient received mucomyst prior to the contrast CT here which
was continued for her cardiac catheterization. Her renal function
remained stable and normal throughout her hospital stay.
3. GU: She has a history of recurrent UTIs and has been on bactrim
prophylaxis here. Urine cultures on 5/24 and 4/20 have been negative.
4. Dispo: She is being discharged in stable condition with instruction
to follow up with her PCP ( Dr. Alejandro Linkon ).
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: VNA instruction for BP checks and Physical Therapy
For patient: please continue to take plavix for at least 1 year and
work w/ PCP/Cardiologist whether or not to continue indefinitely
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
