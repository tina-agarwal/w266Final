HISTORY: Ms. Pizzo is a 63-year-old woman with peripheral vascular
disease who recently underwent revision of her left
superior femoral artery anterior tibial bypass graft , who now
presents with a cool , ischemic left foot.
Mrs. Denman is a 63-year-old , insulin-dependent diabetic with a long
history of peripheral vascular disease as well as multiple surgical
procedures. She underwent a right transmetatarsal amputation in
1990 and subsequently underwent a right femorla distal saphenous
vein bypass graft in 1991 which was later revised in 1992. She
seems to be doing well with the left side until July of this year ,
at which time she underwent a left superficial femoral artery to
anterior tibial artery bypass using non-reversed basilic vein
harvested from the right arm. She , however , had a large great toe
ulcer , possibly attributed to hammertoe , which subsequently
underwent a left great toe amputation performed on the 21 of October . After this time , she was discharged to the Nut Hospital in
Amore Pu , where she was making progress in physical therapy and
rehabilitation. On the day prior to admission , she was exercising
with 4 pound weights on her legs with the physical therapist when
she described a cool sensation in her foot. She reported that her
foot had been blue , and there were no Dopplerable pulses. Color
later returned. The absence of pulses persisted over the course of
the night , after which point she was referred back to Largrine Medical Center for evaluation. She denies any significant pain
or any other complications.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for history of insulin-dependent
diabetes , history of coronary artery
disease , history of hypertension , cataracts , MRSA from her toe
wound on the 2 of September .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Notable for the above , as well as
debridements of her toe amputation wound
site.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , insulin Lente 12
units subcu q p.m. supplemented by sliding
scale regular insulin scale , Isordil 30 mg t.i.d. , Zestril 5 mg q
d , Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg b.i.d. , Ofloxacin 200 mg
p.o. q 12 , Ecotrin 225 mg q d , Vancomycin 1250 mg q 24. She
reports an allergy to codeine and iodine.
ADMISSION EXAMINATION: Remarkable for the following findings:
She was afebrile , heart rate 72 , blood
pressure 140/70. Her right lower extremity was characterized by a
well-healed transmetatarsal amputation site. The foot was warm and
pink. The left side , however , was cool in comparison , although
remained pink with adequate capillary refill. Both femoral pulses
were easily palpable , as well as dorsal pedal pulse on the right.
Her right posterior tibial pulse was additionally biphasic by
Doppler. On the left , she had a biphasic Doppler graft pulse and
dorsopedal , although she had no identifiable posterior tibial
pulse. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.
Admission labs were likewise unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Bulger was admitted and placed on intravenous
Heparin until the following morning , at which
time she proceeded to the Angiography Suite. She was found to have
two 95% stenosis in a long segment of the left SFA and the left
distal SFA and anterior tibial vein graft was completely
thrombosed. She was successfully treated with stent placement and
received heparin and urokinase in the Intensive Care Unit overnight
with a turn-over pulses of the left leg Doppler. The following
day , her stents were removed. During the remainder of the hospital
course , her left foot remained pink and warm. Her wound had an
infection of exposed bone , but otherwise appeared to be granulating
well. Although left transmetatarsal amputation being considered ,
it was felt that she had a good chance of healing the wound
appropriately. She had a single temperature spike , although all
cultures remained negative. She had continuation of her Heparin
while she was started on a course of Coumadin to reserve patency of
her graft. The remainder of the hospital course was unremarkable.
On the 13 of July , she was discharged back to the Rose-walt Hospital in Coln

INR of 2.0 , last target 1.6 , then received 10 mg in evening x 2.
Additionally , Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q 4 prn , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , insulin NPH 10 units subcu b.i.d. , sliding scale insulin
subcu q 4 , Isordil 30 mg t.i.d. , Zestril 5 mg q d , Lopressor 50 mg
b.i.d. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. She will follow with Dr. Noah in
