185076505 | BMC | 25759757 | | 6146391 | 1/20/2005 12:00:00 AM | CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 3/30/2005 Report Status: Signed

Discharge Date: 1/7/2005
ATTENDING: REOPELL , ROLF M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
This is the diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is
sinus arrest with apnea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy ( EF of 55% on this admission , although
prior admission indicating an EF of 35% ) , diabetes , obstructive
sleep apnea , obesity hypoventilation syndrome , atrial flutter
status post ablation. On 7/28/05 , he presented with shortness
of breath as well as a witnessed apneic episode. His recent
history is significant for having stopped his Lasix dose one week
prior to admission due to increased frustration with
incontinence. Since then , he has had increasing shortness of
breath , orthopnea , bilateral lower edema , and dyspnea on exertion
to the point of symptoms upon walking 10 feet. In the Centsshealt Careman Inerist Medical Center Emergency Department , he was found to be
saturating 91% on room air and 99% on a nonrebreather. An ABG
showed a pH of 7.31 and a PCO2 of 55; he was tried on BiPAP
without improvement in either PCO2 or PO2. While being
interviewed by the medical residents , he was seen to have a
30-second apneic episode with loss of consciousness and cyanosis;
his sensorium quickly returned after this event , although he
retained no memory of this occurrence. He received Lasix 80 mg
x1 , Solu-Medrol , and DuoNebs in the ED. He was admitted to the
CCU initially with CHF/apnea/sinus arrest , and subsequently
transferred to the hospital floor when he was stable.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
8/21 echo with an EF of 35% and global left ventricular
hypokinesis; 2/10 echo with an EF of 55% , without hypokinesis.
2. Atrial flutter , status post ablation ( 2003 ).
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Hyperostosis frontalis.
5. Complex renal cyst versus angiomyolipoma , resected via
laparoscopy in 6/9 . 
6. Morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency ( baseline creatinine 2 ).
MEDICATIONS:
1. Allopurinol.
2. Iron.
3. Lisinopril.
4. Toprol-XL.
5. Coumadin ( discontinued on 2/4/05 ).
6. Albuterol inhaler p.r.n.
7. Aspirin.
8. Flomax.
9. Hytrin.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives alone at Rys Ville Santster He is a retired Burg Bovalle Ge
employee. He is an ex-smoker , quit in the 1960s. He is a heavy
drinker in his 20s , but now he rarely drinks alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Gastric cancer in his father.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature of 96 , pulse of 53 , blood pressure of 125/65 , and
saturating 94% on 2 liters by nasal cannula. In general , alert
and oriented , in no acute distress. HEENT: Pupils are equally
round and reactive to light , sclerae are anicteric , moist mucous
membranes. Cardiovascular exam: Regular rate and rhythm , normal
S1 and S2 , although JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus.
Lung exam: Clear to auscultation bilaterally , no wheezes or
crackles. Abdomen: Obese , soft and nontender , normal abdominal
bowel sounds. Extremities: 2+ edema.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
Notable for creatinine of 2.3 ( at baseline ) , BNP of 500. His
admission EKG: Sinus rhythm with occasional bradycardia to the
40s , no ST changes.
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
Assessment and Plan: A 71-year-old female with a history of
obesity hypoventilation syndrome , restrictive lung disease ,
diabetes , nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF ,
who was admitted for congestive heart failure , sinus arrest ,
ultimately treated with diuresis and a pacemaker placement.
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: No active issues during this
hospitalization. Pump: The patient had a history nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy with a preserved EF , ( an echo during this
hospitalization revealed an EF of 55% without hypokinesis ,
although prior echo in 2003 showed an EF of 35% with global left
ventricular hypokinesis ). On admission , the patient had signs
and symptoms of volume overload in a setting of having not taken
his Lasix for about a week. He was admitted initially to the
CCU , and subsequently transferred to the floor , with aggressive
diuresis of approximately 10 kg since admission ( including
diuresis with ultrafiltration in the CCU ). Following transfer to
the floor , he was switched to Lasix diuresis , which was titrated
down gradually to 40 mg daily , ( cautioned with administration
giving a rise in creatinine ). The patient was also maintained on
captopril , which was up titrated to 25 mg t.i.d. ( held at one
point due to the rise in the creatinine ). The patient was also
titrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. Rhythm: The patient
was followed by the Electrophysiology Service. In the CCU , he
was noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting of
apnea. Following transfer to the floor , he was noted to have
sinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea. His
last such episode was on 3/29/05 .  In addition , the patient has
history of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation. On
0/5/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalic
veins , which he tolerated well.
2. Pulmonary: The patient , as noted above , had several episodes
of apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest.
Following diuresis , the patient's apnea episodes improved. He
was recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient.
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine roughly
around baseline ( 2 ) , which rose briskly during his
hospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 0/5/05 .  His FENa on
admission was 6-8%; a repeat FENa in the setting of his peak
serum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was
1.86%. His urine eosinophils were negative. His UA showed
evidence of a UTI plus triple phosphate crystals; urine culture
showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology. It was
thought that the rise in the patient's creatinine was likely due
to a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly UTI.
The patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemaker
placement , which would be expected to cover GU microbial flora
and SNHU microbes.
4. Endocrine: The patient had a history of diabetes and was
maintained on a Regular Insulin sliding scale.
5. ID: The patient was expected to having an UTI as noted
above. Following his pacemaker placement , he was placed on
cefazolin while in-house , followed by Keflex. The patient should
stay on Keflex for four days.
