HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent the following procedures
while a patient here at Dalu Health 1. EGD 3/4/03 , by Dr. Fjeld . 2. Coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with saphenous vein graft to PDA ,
saphenous vein graft to second obtuse marginal artery , and LIMA to
LAD , by Dr. Gerould . 3. Colonoscopy 0/24/03 .  4. Right colectomy ,
sigmoid colectomy , open cholecystectomy , transverse mucous fistula ,
and sigmoid mucous fistula on 0/8/03 that was by Dr. Stenman .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: Neurological: The patient has had no
neurological events during his
hospitalization. He continues on Paxil 40 mg p.o. q. day for
depression , and he has no pain.
Cardiovascular: The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman who
presents with recurrent unstable angina. His prior episode had
been in 1977 at which time he was found to have modest triple
vessel coronary disease. He had been medically managed
successfully , but presented with recurrent unstable angina. An
ejection fraction was 42% with inferior hypokinesis to akinesis.
Preoperatively , he was found to have severe triple vessel coronary
artery disease. The patient was taken for coronary artery bypass
grafting times three as described above on 7/17/03 .  This was
performed by Dr. Tatom without complications. The patient
improved well postoperatively. He was at the point of being ready
for discharge to rehabilitation when a bed was available. Because
he had been found to be guaiac positive preoperatively , it was
decided to perform a colonoscopy before his discharge. The rest of
his GI history will be discussed below in the GI section.
The other significant event regarding the patient's cardiac system
occurred on his way to the Operating Room on 0/8/03 , with an acute
abdomen. While transferring the patient to the Operating Room
table , he had a cardiac arrest lasting one and a half minutes. He
was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Following the operation a an
EKG was needed emergently. The patient ruled out for an MI. He
did have postoperative atrial fibrillation. He is currently in
normal sinus rhythm , but slips in and out of atrial fibrillation.
His rate is well controlled on Lopressor 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. ,
amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q. day. He has been anticoagulated with
Coumadin , and he is currently therapeutic with his most recent INR
on 1/23/03 of 2.6. His most recent Coumadin doses have been five mg
on 3/26/30 , three mg on 10/14 , zero mg on 1/17/2 ,
and four mg on 2/10 .  The patient's primary cardiologist is Dr.
Brant , and the patient will follow-up with Dr. Vandebrink .
His most recent INR is 2.4 on 5/14/03 , and his Coumadin will be
dosed at rehabilitation today.
Respiratory: The patient was intubated for his procedures. He was
extubated without difficulty. He currently has no respiratory
issues. His oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. His most recent
chest x-ray was a portable chest x-ray on 4/27/03 , which showed
subsegmental atelectasis and a minimal right pleural effusion , but
no evidence of congestive heart failure or other disease processes.
Gastrointestinal: A preoperative work-up before his coronary
artery bypass graft surgery showed that the patient was guaiac
positive and EGD on 3/4/03 by Dr. Zadorozny showed no lesions as a
likely cause of his GI bleeding , but did reveal some gastritis. It
was decided that it would be safe to proceed with surgery , and have
the patient follow-up with a colonoscopy after his procedure.
Discharge was planned , and before discharge a colonoscopy was
performed on 0/24/03 by Dr. Bealer . A single large pedunculated
smooth polyp at 25 centimeters from the anus was found. After this
procedure the patient did well initially , but then did develop
abdominal distention. At first it was thought that his symptoms
were due to Ogilivie's syndrome or pseudo-obstruction , however ,
because of his distention it was not felt safe to perform a barium
enema. A KUB showed air throughout the colon and small bowel. He
had absolutely no pain or tenderness. The General Surgery Service
was consulted and an NG tube was placed , and he was given enemas
p.r. He did well with no complaints of pain or tenderness ,
however , a KUB on 4/8/03 showed that his cecum was distended 12
centimeters and the white count was over 20. CT scan showed a
cecum to be 14 centimeters and there was a suggestion of narrowing
of the sigmoid colon. It was decided to take him to the Operating
Room. A routine chest x-ray showed free air in the diaphragm which
was concerning and surgery was undertaken. Please see the
operative note of Dr. Jou for details regarding this procedure.
A right colectomy , sigmoid colectomy , cholecystectomy ,
transverse mucous fistula , and sigmoid mucous fistula were
performed. The patient improved well postoperatively. We were
able to advance his diet and discontinue his two JP drains. At
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet. His wound is
healing well and his staples have been removed. Intraoperatively
the patient was found to have obstruction of the sigmoid colon and
a pathological specimen revealed adenocarcinoma moderately
differentiated , four centimeters in maximum dimension. The tumor
invaded through the rest of the pericolonic fat. Margins were
clear and ten lymph nodes were negative for disease. The stage of
the tumor is T4BN0MX. The patient will follow-up with Dr. Walken
regarding further management of this cancer.
GU: Two attempts have been made to discontinue the patient's Foley
catheter most recently on 1/23/03 .  He had a high postvoid residual ,
the Foley catheter was left in. The patient is on Flomax. He will
be discharged with a Foley in place and discontinuation of the
Foley should be tried again in seven days. His most recent set of
electrolytes on 5/14/03 include a potassium of 4.3 , magnesium 1.8.
He is making good urine output.
Hematology: The patient has had no hematologic issues during his
hospitalization. His anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation is
covered above. His most recent laboratory values on 5/14/03 , are
white blood cells 6.8 , hematocrit 30.4 , platelets 247 , PT 25.7 , PTT
49.8 , INR of 2.4.
Infectious disease: The patient was treated with perioperative
ampicillin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl. He is currently on no
antibiotics and has no infectious disease issues. His white count
is 6.8 and he is afebrile.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
FOLLOW-UP: Dr. Pruna call for appointment in one to two weeks.
Dr. Alfaro call for an appointment in one to two
weeks. Dr. Laubscher call clinic for appointment in four weeks. Dr.
Fanti call for appointment after discharge from rehabilitation.
