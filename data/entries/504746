HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old man who
was morbidly obese and presented with
dyspnea , pedal edema , and chest discomfort. At baseline , the
patient was unable to walk from room to room at home without
becoming dyspneic. He used a BiPAP with pressure support of 15 and
PEEP of 10 on room air at night. Over the past two weeks , however ,
the patient had noted gradually worsening dyspnea with minimal
exertion now such as just turning over or sometimes even at rest.
Concomitantly , patient had noted , initially , left calf and ankle
swelling approximately one week ago that improved after several
days then right calf and ankle swelling and tenderness which still
persisted. He also noted upper respiratory symptoms with
intermittent dry cough , sinus pain , and congestion over the past
week. He denied fever or chills. He had experienced intermittent
chest spasm which he distinguished from cardiac pain. This pain
felt like spasms generally experienced in his arms. The patient
had experienced no constipation but had intermittent diarrhea which
was then thought to be secondary to colchicine therapy. The
patient presented to the Emergency Department for further work-up.

saturation 98% on four liters. HEENT: Pupils equal , round , and

ankle , trace edema on the left , right calf tenderness , no warmth ,

LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , sodium was 147 , potassium
4.2 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 24 ,
creatinine 1.8 , glucose 91 , AST 14 , alkaline phosphatase 52 ,
albumin 4.1 , calcium 8.5 , CK 311 , MB 1.5 , troponin I 0.3 , white
blood cell count 8.6 with polys 695 , lymphocytes 21 , monocytes 8 ,
and eosinophils 1 , hematocrit 40.9 , platelets 200 , PT 13.4 , and PTT
25.0. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 74 with intervals
0.22/0.14/0.45 , axis minus 38 degrees , left atrial enlargement ,
intraventricular conduction defect , T wave inversion in II , III ,
and V6 , and no change since 0/27 .  Chest x-ray showed low lung
volumes and VQ scan showed high probability for pulmonary embolism
in let lower lobe , left upper lobe , and right upper lobe.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 57 year old morbidly obese man with
extensive past medical history now admitted with
progressive dyspnea over the past two weeks and studies showing
pulmonary embolism. The patient was started on intravenous
Heparin. The dose of Heparin was increased until his PTT was in
the range of 60 to 80 seconds. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin
was initiated at 15 mg each night. After three nights of therapy ,
the patient's INR was 1.4 so his dose was increased to 20 mg per
night. After two nights of this therapy , his INR started to rise
to 2.3 and his dose was decreased to 15 mg. His INR the next
morning was 2.6. Intravenous Heparin therapy was discontinued.
The patient also had right ankle pain and erythema that was
consistent with a flare of gout. His dose of colchicine was
increased from 0.6 mg b.i.d. to t.i.d. Allopurinol was also
started for uric acid levels of 7.9. The patient had symptoms of
sinusitis likely from his use of BiPAP at home. He was started on
trimethoprim/sulfamoxole double-strength twice a day. Physical
therapy was initiated. The patient was able to transfer himself
from bed to chair and was able to ambulate approximately sixty feet
with minimal dyspnea. An extra-wide heavy duty rolling walker was
obtained to help the patient maintain his balance.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home with VNA services.
A nurse will draw his blood tests for INR testing. A
home safety evaluation will also be performed.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Warfarin 15 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Albuterol two
puffs inhaled t.i.d. with spacer ,
beclomethasone two puffs inhaled t.i.d. with spacer , rinse with
