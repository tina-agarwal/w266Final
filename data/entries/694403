Discharge Date: 10/15/2002
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sciatica.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Forty-six-year-old fell out of bed
yesterday reaching for something. She
fell on her coccyx. She had no loss of consciousness , no head
trauma. She was unable to get up secondary to pain and body
habitus. EMS was called and returned patient to bed , however , she
refused to come into the hospital in spite of her pain. The
following morning she was still with consider lower back and
buttock pain radiating to her right leg. She took her normal
oxycodone and Vicodin doses without relief , and EMS brought the
patient to the hospital. The patient states that pain is like
previous episodes of sciatica , radicular pain , but exacerbated by
her fall. In the emergency department , patient was afebrile , vital
signs stable. She received Ativan , Motrin , Dilaudid with little
effect. Plain films were negative for fracture. She was unable to
ambulate , and therefore admitted.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , myocardial infarction non-Q-wave
July , 2001 , a MICU admission during that time , in July , 2001 ,
for urosepsis , diabetic ketoacidosis and this non-Q-wave MI. Also ,
sciatica with previous history of a herniated disc L5-S1 , question
obstructive sleep apnea with mild pulmonary hypertension by
previous echo.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy complicated by wound
infection.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor , Zestril , aspirin , Toprol , morphine , insulin
and Vicodin.
STUDIES: July , 2001 , MIBI showed an old , moderately sized MI
in mid LAD distribution with moderate residual
peri-infarct ischemia. An July , 2001 , echo showed left
ventricular ejection fraction 50% , hypokinesis in the inferior
septum , mildly enlarged RV , pulmonary artery pressures of 39 plus
RA , suggestive of mild pulmonary hypertension and mild MR and TR.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , labs were significant for a glucose
of 121 , creatinine 1.4 , baseline was one ,
potassium of 5.2 , CK of 355 , a UA with plus two leukocyte esterase ,
85 whites , plus two bacteria.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Patient had temperature of 99 , heart rate 67 ,
respirations of 17 , blood pressure 130/50 , and
saturation 97% on room air. She was in no distress. She was
obese. She had no head trauma. Her neck was supple , normal S1 ,
S2. Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen
was markedly obese , positive bowel sounds , nontender. She had a
skin abrasion on her left elbow. She had no spinal tenderness , no
pelvic tenderness. She was unable to raise her right leg secondary
to pain. She did have pain with straight leg left on the right.
She had normal sensation in upper and lower extremities.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted and was scheduled to undergo
an MRI for evaluation of acutely herniated disc
at an outside facility at Y Wau Topelum , secondary to not being able to
fit within the coils at our own facility. However , she was unable
to receive this MRI secondary to inability to have assistance with
transfer of her when she reached the facility. Initially , her pain
was managed with both immediate-release and sustained-release
morphine and Valium for spasm. She also received around-the-clock
high-dose NSAIDs and was evaluated by physical therapy and
nutrition. Her UTI was treated with Bactrim. On hospital day
three , her creatinine jumped to 2.9 from 1.4. She was also
hyperkalemic to 5.9. Her NSAIDs were stopped and Neurontin was
DCed secondary to somnolence. However , she continued to have
worsening renal failure , hypertension and somnolence , and blood gas
showed primary respiratory acidosis , hypercarbia and she was
ultimately transferred to the MICU for intubation for airway
protection secondary to aspiration. By May , her creatinine had
returned to baseline. She was extubated without complications.
Her renal function was presumed to be secondary high-dose NSAIDs ,
and her intubation was deemed to be secondary to a primary
respiratory acidosis from opioid intoxication exacerbated by renal
failure. Issues are as follows by systems:
Pulmonary: Overnight pulse oximetry was performed , which will be
analyzed to assess for obstructive sleep apnea. Patient will most
likely need a form of sleep study at rehabilitation or as an
outpatient to address this obstructive sleep apnea issue. Data
from this admission do not support a diagnosis of obesity
hypoventilation syndrome , because there was no daytime hypercapnia
by both ABGs and Chem-7 panel.
Renal: Acute renal insufficiency resolved with hydration ,
withdrawal of NSAIDs. We will hold her ACE inhibitor secondary to
recent renal failure , and she will need to have this evaluated in
two weeks or so.
Infectious disease: The patient with low-grade fevers on empiric
Levofloxacin and Flagyl day seven of 14 for aspiration pneumonia
suffered during hypocarbic respiratory arrest. The patient was
also placed on two days of vancomycin , after one of the blood
cultures in the ICU grew coagulase negative Staph. All cultures
since then have been negative. Patient also had two episodes of
liquid stool on Flagyl , day six. She was already receiving therapy
for C. difficile. Because she has been in the hospital more than
three days , an O&amp;P is very low yield. Stool cultures and a repeat
chest x-ray will be done if clinical worsens tomorrow.
Neurologic: Patient with known small right lateral recess disc
herniation impinging on right nerve root at L5-S1. She has
previous received steroid injections for this and has refused
surgery secondary to very bad experience with the total abdominal
hysterectomy complicated by wound infection. She has had an acute
exacerbation of this pain with her fall. We were unable to obtain
an MRI at outside facility because of her body habitus and need for
assistance with movement. She would benefit from aggressive PT and
pain control with eventual surgery if these more conservative
measures fail.
Pain: The patient was oversedated on pain medications and was
actually intubated for the need to balance desire to alleviate pain
with need for patient to have adequate respiratory drive.
Endocrine: Continue NPH and CZI and ADA diet. Will begin Meridia.
Patient also seen by nutrition and was given number for weight loss
program.
CV: Non-Q-wave MI in July , 2001. Patient with preserved EF , no
valve disease. Will continue current cardiac regimen. Will need
to restart ACE inhibitor in two to three weeks , now that renal
failure resolved.
Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous Heparin , Protime pump inhibitor , and
Dulcolax and Lactulose p.r.n. for constipation while on narcotics.
Social: I have written a letter regarding the patient's need for
first-floor apartment secondary to inability to use stairs. It is
in her chart.
Additional comments: Please monitor patient carefully for
oversedation on current medications. Patient will need sleep study
to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.
