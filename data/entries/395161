Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: JOSILOWSKY , ODELL MD
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: Dr. Freddie Fluegge , 006-879-6983
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Wiest is an 83-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems including CAD status post CABG ,
diabetes mellitus , CHF ( EF 55% ) and atrial fibrillation who
presented with hypotension , likely secondary to sepsis from right
lower extremity cellulitis. She developed the right lower
extremity cellulitis one month ago. Two days prior to
admission , pt developed worsening erythema , edema and tenderness
along with chills and sweats. She was brought into the emergency
room on 11/0/06 and was found to be hypotensive with a systolic
blood pressure in the 80s. She was given IV fluids and started
on vancomycin , aztreonam , and clindamycin , but remained
hypotensive. She was started on dopamine , Levophed and
vasopressin as well as Decadron. Surgery was consulted for biopsy as to rule
out the possibility of necrotizing fascitis. A
CT of her lower extremity was done in the ED and she was admitted to the MICU.
Pt's blood cultures grew group A streptococcus. Her wound culture grew
group A strep and E. coli. Pt was also dx with a klebseilla UTI. Her
antibiotics were changed to vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl.
Her blood pressure improved and on the day of transfer to the
floor on 4/15/06 , she was noted to be oliguric , presumably
due ATN secondary to hypotension. Her urine
output continued to drop and she developed a metabolic acidosis
with a bicarbonate of 10. Her lactic acid at that point was 4.4. Her ABG was:
7. 8/23/98 and she was transferred back to the
MICU.
From a renal perspective , ARF was less likely to be post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis because of the timing of her strep infection.
She had no hypertension or WBC casts. The UA was
positive for hematuria. She had low complement levels , so there
was some question of HUS after group B strep infection ,
although there were no schistocytes on her smear. The pt was
aneuric on admission to the MICU and she started renal
replacement therapy. Her urine output recovered and
was greater than 800 mL daily while in the ICU.
However , by the day of transfer to the floor on 9/27/06 , her urine output
started to decrease and she started intermittent
dialysis via a tunneled LIJ catheter. The renal team followed her closely and
her meds were renally dosed. Her vancomycin was dosed by level.
In terms of her hypertension , her blood pressure has normalized and
her beta-blocker is being titrated upwards.
From a cardiac perspective , the pt's troponin hit a high of
0.87 in the setting of septic shock. She was evaluated by MMMC
cardiology , and this was felt to be consistent with demand
ischemia. She has actually been asymptomatic from a cardiac
standpoint. She was continued on daily aspirin. Her LDL was 63
and a statin was started. She will actually need her fasting
lipids checked once her acute illness has passed and her LDL goal
is less than 70. The patient has a history of AFIB on Coumadin.
Her INR goal is 2-3. Her INR is drifting down. She is off of
Coumadin because she has several lines that needed to be pulled ,
including a right subclavian. The hemodialysis catheter will either be
removed , if she has improved urine output , or a more permanent type of access
will be placed. She will be on prophylactic heparin t.i.d. for DVT
prophylaxis when her INR hits 1.5.
From a hematologic perspective , the patient initially had thrombocytopenia on
admission. There was some concern for DIC , as there was a very quick rise in
her INR. Fibrinogen; however , was normal and the INR has since stabilized. She
has persistent thrombocytopenia , although her platelet count is recovering.
Her platelet factor 4 antibody was negative.
There was no clear precipitant other than sepsis. She has a
normocytic anemia with a large drop in hematocrit since admission and
there was some concern for hemolysis with the rising
bilirubin , low haptoglobin with multiple immature erythrocytes ,
but no schistocytes were seen on manual diff. She did require
two units of packed red blood cells on this admission. Her
hematocrit and platelets did drop on 1/26/06 as the steroids were being
tapered off. Her direct Coombs was negative. Haptoglobin
was within normal limits. Medications causing her
thrombocytopenia like Seroquel and heparin were stopped.
From a pulmonary standpoint , she is oxygenating and ventilating
well and not requiring any supplemental O2. She started tube
feeds on 5/15/06 with some marked hyperglycemia and also
steroids for her hypotension contributing to her hyperglycemia.
She was actually started on an IV insulin protocol in the ICU for better
control and then was transitioned to NPH insulin plus regular
insulin as well as a regular insulin sliding scale with good effect.
Her home regimen was previously Lantus 25 units SC daily. Her
TSH was within normal limits and she will continue levothyroxine.
The patient developed a pain in her left fourth finger during this admission
and the PIP joint was tapped on 1/26/06 by rheumatology. The
appearance of the fluid was consistent with gout. She improved with steroids.
Her right shoulder ultrasound showed a small effusion , which was unlikely to be
infectious per radiology. She was started on Decadron 4 mg p.o. q.6h. , and only
has mild , residual pain.
From a GI perspective , pt's LFTs rose on 2/2/06
with peak ALT of 122 , T bili of 8.7 , and alkaline phosphatase of
196. She had a rising INR ( off of Coumadin ) consistent with
hepatic injury and hepatocellular dysfunction. Her abdominal CT was
unremarkable. GI was consulted. The etiology was unclear and the differential
diagnosis was drug related liver injury versus infection or shock liver , and
less likely , fatty liver disease. Her hepatitis serologies are
negative and Tylenol has been held since 2/2/06 . Flagyl
and clindamycin were discontinued on 5/15/06 , and her LFTs
trended down. AMA was negative. ASMA was pending at the time of this
dictation.
From a neurologic point of view , the patient initially required
Dilaudid PCA for pain with her legs. Now , she is comfortable on a fentanyl
patch with Dilaudid boluses. Seroquel was started for sedation
and that was actually stopped because of thrombocytopenia.
From a dermatologic standpoint , she has had left lower extremity
venostasis ulcers. She has a right lower extremity arterial
insufficiency ulcer. She was seen by wound care. Vascular
surgery requested that she have ABIs and assessment of her vascular
flow once her acute illness has passed.
For nutrition , the patient started tube feeds through an NG tube given her
prolonged sedation. She will need to continue to improve her nutritional
status. A speech and swallow evaluation was done on 2/4/07
and she has been approved for oral , soft diet.
In terms of access , pt has a right subclavian left IJ hemodialysis catheter.
She had a left radial artery line that was discontinued on 5/15/06 . The right
subclavian will be removed when her INR is 1.5 and the
hemodialysis catheter will either be removed or replaced with
more permanent access depending on her urine output.
For prophylaxis , she is on Nexium. She does not have
pneumo boots on because of cellulitis and heparin was held with
thrombocytopenia , now will be restarted on 2/4/07 or when her
INR is 1.5 rather.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus type II on insulin , CAD
status post CABG ( 1998 ). The right saphenous vein was harvested

IMPRESSION: Ms. Holoman is an 83-year-old woman with multiple
medical problems presenting with hypotension likely secondary to
sepsis from her right lower extremity cellulitis and a klebsiella UTI.
PLAN:
1. ID: The patient had group A strep bacteremia likely due to
cellulitis. She was treated empirically with vancomycin x6
weeks. Day one was 7/3/06 . Vancomycin was being dosed bilevel
as the patient was requiring hemodialysis and had decreased urine
output. Echocardiogram was unremarkable for vegetations. Second
echo was pending on 2/4/07 at the time of this dictation to
rule out any kind of vegetation. She did have some spots on her
toes that looked like possible Janeway lesions. Klebsiella UTI
was treated with levofloxacin.
2. Renal: The patient is oliguric acute renal failure on
chronic with question of either a result of sepsis and
vasodilatation and hypotension versus a true ATN. She has been
requiring hemodialysis. Last dialysis was 2/4/07 . Urine
output and improving. The patient may have a permanent tunneled
catheter placed depending on how her urine output recovers. We
will use Lasix p.r.n. to manage volume.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient had demand ischemia with a peak
troponin of 0.87 with septic. Her LDL was 63 and a statin was
started. She will continue her aspirin and beta-blocker. We
will recheck her fasting lipids when the acute illness has
resolved as an outpatient. The patient now has normal blood
pressure with titrating her beta-blocker up and considering
adding a second agent to normalize her hypotension. We are
avoiding Ace inhibitors because of her acute renal failure. She
has AFIB , sick sinus syndrome. She is on Coumadin as an
outpatient , has a permanent pacemaker. We are holding her
Coumadin for now and this can be resumed once decision has been
made about hemodialysis access. She had an elevated INR in the
ICU , presumably due to shock liver , as her other LFTs are
also increased simultaneously.
4. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus. She has
elevated blood sugars on tube feeds and steroids. We are
titrating up her insulin. Her home regimen is Lantus. the tube
feeds were discontinued on 2/4/07 as the patient was cleared to
eat a diabetic diet and we will transition her insulin
accordingly. She is hypothyroid and we should continue her home
Levoxyl.
5. Rheumatology: The patient had a gout flare in her left hand ,
right shoulder , and right knee. Taps were consistent with gout.
The cultures were no growth to date. She is on a dexamethasone
taper , however decreasing to 1 mg IV q.12h. on 11/0/07 per
rheumatology.
6. Heme: The patient had persistently low platelets and anemia.
Initially , it was a concern for DIC , but the fibrinogen was
normal. There was some concern for hemolysis. Her hematocrit
and platelets dropped in the setting of tapering her steroids and
she actually did require two units of packed red cells on
1/26/06 . Her dexamethasone was then increased. In response to
that , heparin was stopped. Her platelet factor IV antibody is
negative. We will continue to follow her counts as we taper the
steroids. It could be possible that the changes in her
hematocrit and platelets are due to sepsis.
7. GI on 2/2/06 , she developed elevated LFTs. We continued to
follow the trend of her LFTs and they have decreasing at the time
of this dictation.
8. Neurology: The patient has severe pain from gout. She is on
a Dilaudid PCA initially , now is on her home fentanyl patch with
Dilaudid boluses p.r.n.
9. Dermatology: The patient has a history of venostasis ulcers
and right arterial lower extremity insufficiency. She was seen
by wound care and vascular surgery , were continued to follow
their recommendations and when she is an outpatient , she should
have ABIs. She could not have an MRI to study flow to those legs
as she has a pacemaker.
10. FEN: The patient is on a mechanical soft diet with thin
liquids on 2/4/07 . Nutrition is following.
11. Prophylaxis: The patient will need DVT prophylaxis when INR
hits 1.5. She is on a PPI while she is on steroids.
DISPOSITION: Rehabilitation. She has a right subclavian line
that should be removed prior to discharge , and a decision about
the hemodialysis catheter should be made.
Her healthcare proxy is her daughter , Trotochaud , her cell number
668-657-7261 , home number is 385-451-1580.
CODE: DNR/DNI.
CONTINUED CARE PLAN:
1. Follow up the results of all cultures to resolution.
2. Remove right subclavian line.
3. Make a decision about whether or not the patient will need
intermittent hemodialysis and if so , through what access.
4. Resume Coumadin once that access has been placed or once all lines have
been removed.
5. Recheck lipids as an outpatient.
6. ABIs for both legs and followup of chronic , non-healing wound.
7. Continue vancomycin.
