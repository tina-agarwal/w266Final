BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
71 yo man with CAD s/p 3vCABG/PCI , PAF , HTN ,
NIDDM , CHF ( EF 60% in 1999; diastolic dysfxn ) here with 1-2 wks of DOE
and throat tightness. Originally s/f stress test but found to be in
afib w/ RVR ( 120s ) before test. Taken to ED where
given IV lopressor , ASA , IV heparin with
improved symptoms after HR control to 90-100s.
PE: afebrile BP 135/72 HR 111--&gt; 96 RR 20 SaO2 97% 2L; irreg irreg
rhythm no m/g/r , JVP 8 cm , CTAB , soft belly , no LE edema , neg neuro
exam Labs: Neg cardiac enzymes x 1 , Cr 0.9 , Hct
39.5 , WBC 9.37 , INR 1.0; EKG with new TWF I , V6 , TWI
L; CXR
neg. Course: CAD with PAF now with DOE and
throat tightness and re-conversion to afib.
1. CV: -ischemia: Doubted ACS but given signif CAD , needed to ROMI
--&gt; resulted in 3 sets of neg cardiac enzymes. Adenosine MIBI
revealed no ischemia- c/w normal study. Continued on ASA but decreased
to 81mg only , statin , BB: but increased Atenolol to 50 mg from 25mg
qd , ACEI , IV heparin.
Held plavix , IIb/IIIa. - Rhythm: atrial fibrillation on admission but
converted to NSR after rate control with beta blockade. Echocardiogram
revealed no dramatic changes from prior studdy in 1999: EF 50-55% with
LA size in the upper limits , no LA thrombus; PASP 35 + RAP and isolated
HK in inferior septum ( similar to mild HK seen in mid-septum in 1999 ).
TSH was within normal limits and D-dimer was negative
suggesting against PE. Rate control was increased with increased
atenolol. Pt refused lovenox shots and will be discharged on coumadin
for CVA prophylaxis. INR should be followed on 9/10 am by Spe Health
at RAH .  - Pump: euvolemic but hx of diastolic dyxfxn.Echo was not sign
ificantly altered from 1999 as noted above. No diuresis was necessary.
2. Pulm: suppl O2 and DOE was likely cardiac-related. Workup as above.
3. Renal: stable Cr
4. Neuro: Dilantin for sz d/o. Dilantin level was in therapeutic
range ( 10 ) on admit.
5. GI: Ranitidine for PUD
6. Psych: Chlordiazepoxide per home dosing
7. Dispo: Pt will be discharged in stable condition. He should follow
up with Newthic for INR check on 9/10 days and coumadin
adjustment.
