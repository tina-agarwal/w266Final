Discharge Date: 8/3/1992
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 37 year old woman
with dilated cardiomyopathy admitted
with positional chest pain associated with viral prodrome. PAST
MEDICAL HISTORY revealed the patient was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy in 10-89. She was worked up at the Ingvid's Health Services with a conclusion of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ,
work-up unavailable. The patient was discharged on Lasix , digoxin
and an ACE inhibitor. In 20 of May , the patient was admitted to Orecross Medical Center after complaining of positional chest pain ,
shortness of breath and fatigue. She was diagnosed with dilated
cardiomyopathy and received an echocardiogram , which revealed large
ventricles , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. In
7 of July , the patient underwent a bicycle exercise tolerance test and
endured 10 minutes and 16 seconds , limited by fatigue. Peak heart
rate was 104 , peak blood pressure was 156/80 , she had a few atrial
premature beats and no ischemic ST-T changes. Her oxygen uptake
was 16.2 milliliters per kilogram per minute. In 4 of October , the patient
underwent right ventriculogram which showed ejection fraction 24%
and global hypokinesis. On the day of admission , on 28 of May , the
patient complained of 4 days of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting and
malaise , followed by sharp severe chest pain in the mid chest below
the left breast radiating to the back , which was relieved by lying
on the left and aggravated by leaning forward or lying on the
right , also worsened by deep breathing and cough , and also with
ventral palpation. The patient claimed that the pain had never
gone away in the past 12 hours , but again was aggravated by certain
positions. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for
cardiomyopathy , hypertension , gastritis , ex-intravenous drug abuser
for 10 years , anemia , and recent crack cocaine use. MEDICATIONS ON
ADMISSION included Lasix , Enalapril and digoxin. ALLERGIES were no
known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was an obese black woman in no
apparent distress. Blood pressure was
162/100 , heart rate 90 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation 99% ,
no pulsus. Eyes were pupils were equal , round , reactive to light ,
extraocular movements intact , muddy sclera. Neck was supple ,
jugular venous pressure was 8 to 10 centimeters , carotids were 2+
bilaterally. Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion
except for a few bibasilar crackles. Heart showed normal S1 and
S2 , no rubs , distant heart sounds , no murmurs were noted. Abdomen
was obese , soft , normal bowel sounds , she was comfortable with deep
palpation diffusely. Extremities showed no edema. Rectal
examination was guaiac negative. Neurologic examination was
nonfocal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Sodium was 137 , potassium 2.7 , chloride
92 , bicarbonate 37 , blood urea nitrogen 7 ,
creatinine .9 , glucose 159 , AST 58 , creatinine phosphokinase 641 ,
with 23% myocardial bands. White count was 4.6 , hematocrit 31.5 ,
platelets 166 , 000 , ESR 60 , prothrombin time 11.3 , partial
thromboplastin time 18. Chest x-ray showed a big heart with mild
congestive heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave
inversions in I , II , F , L , V2 through V6 , consistent with a 1990
electrocardiogram done when she was complaining of positional chest
pain similar to the chest pain she is having now.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted with the thought that
her history was consistent with pericarditis , but
was also worriesome for ischemia given her elevated creatinine
phosphokinase with myocardial band fraction of 23 , and her history
of cocaine abuse. Her hospital course was consistent with
continuation of her pain through the first day of hospitalization
despite and aggressive anti-ischemic regimen. It was found that
hermyocardial band electrophoresis showed no myocardial band
fraction detected , and it was decided that we would shift our
therapy to a more anti-inflammatory regimen to control her
pericarditis. At that time , Indocin was started and the chest pain
resolved. With the resolution of her chest pain , the T-wave
inversions corrected. The patient was transerred to the floor on
Indocin 50 milligrams 3 times a day , aspirin , Bactrim , Enalapril
and Carafate and remained without chest pain for the next 2 days.
She was also seen by the ACE team in consultation about her drug
and alcohol problem , and it was decided that she would be
discharged on 28 of September , after arrangement for follow-up with the ACE
team.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE included aspirin , Indocin 50 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Enalapril 10 milligrams by mouth each day ,
Carafate 1 gram by mouth 4 times a day. The patient is to
FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Dewitt A. Sisler .
