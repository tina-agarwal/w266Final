Discharge Date:
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEART FAILURE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY.
VALVULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY.
MITRAL REGURGITATION.
TRICUSPID REGURGITATION.
HYPERTENSION.
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50 year-old man with
valvular cardiomyopathy , status post
three aortic valve replacements who presents with no acute
complaints but progressive decline in daily function. Mr. Toher 's
history begins in March of 1995 when he presented with shortness of
breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the setting of
medication ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension ).
Noncompliant , he was found by echo to have severe aortic
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular
hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently
underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve
repair , aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration. One
month post surgery he required repeat aortic valve replacement with
dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with
cultures positive for yeast. At this time he also required
coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course was additionally complicated
by the development of third degree heart block
necessitating the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. After
discharge Mr. Ogaz did generally well for the following years
until March of 1999 when he again presented with increasing
shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate to severe aortic
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiac
catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this time his
aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude valve. Again
following discharge Mr. Bassi did generally well until March of
2001 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that
time echo showed at least mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation
with left ventricular dilatation ( systolic diameter 6.1 cm ) along
with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and an
ejection fraction of 15 to 20%. Stress testing at this time showed
a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was
done at this time but apparently his Lasix was increased from 40
b.i.d. to 80 b.i.d. with good effect.
Regarding this admission , Mr. Clyatt reports that he has been
feeling fine and has been in the hospital because his doctors want
to replace his valve , or if that doesn't work to give him a new
heart. He reports no increasing dyspnea , fatigue , ankle edema or
abdominal girth. He sleeps on three pillows at night and has not
recently been shortness of breath when lying flat. He is able to
do chores around the house without getting shortness of breath but
usually does get shortness of breath after one flight of stairs.
He doesn't complain of significant disability or quality of life
impairment as a result of his heart condition. He notes that he
has not been able to participate in the marching band over the last
year but that he is still able to play seated.
Mr. Pattengale attributes his disease to having been noncompliant with
Procardia following a cerebrovascular accident in 1993. He says
that "he brought on his heart problems himself".
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise notable for hypertension , a
cerebrovascular accident in 1993 , an
embolism to the left foot in 1998 and chronic renal insufficiency
with a creatinine of 1.4 to 2.2 in July of 1999.
ALLERGIES: He is allergic to Zestril which gives him perioral
angioedema.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 80 mg b.i.d. , Atenolol 50 mg
q. day , Avapro 150 mg q. day , Coumadin 5
mg q. day , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , Niferex 150 mg q. day.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for heart disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 35 pack/year smoking history and drinks
only occasionally. Mr. Felsenthal is on permanent
disability leave from his job at Ph Lub Ge which involved a lot of
heavy lifting. He lives at home with his wife and son and spends
most of his day there. He is active in a Entsce Pu Si where he
likes to play the base drum.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mr. Pellon is a thin , healthy appearing
black man in no apparent distress. Heart
rate is 65 , blood pressure 120/170. Oxygen saturation 98% on room
air. His carotid pulse was normal in volume. Jugular venous
pressure is 7 cm. His lungs were clear. His PMI was vibratory
and quality and prominent lateral to the anterior axillary line.
He had a normal S1 with an ejection sound and loud prosthetic S2 as
well as a 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and
a 3/4 holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
radiating to the right upper sternal border. His abdomen was
nondistended with no organomegaly. His extremities were warm with
faint pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Labs were remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 ,
hematocrit of 33.5 with an MCV of 83.5. RBW was
28.8 , reticulocyte count of 6.6 and LDH of 1 , 777.
Mr. Coples had an echo here that showed severe aortic insufficiency
with a severely dilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of
7.0 and systolic diameter of 6.3 ) as well as mild to moderate
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and ejection fraction of 20 to
25%. Exercise testing showed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. On cath
his pulmonary artery pressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary
vascular resistance were 47/16 , 13 and 379 which fell to 26/4 , 5
and 137 respectively with Nipride. His systemic vascular
resistance was markedly elevated to 2400 and his thick cardiac
output and cardiac index was 3.62 and 2.31.
Amlodipine was then started and Lasix was increased in an effort to
increase systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary wedge
pressures. The remainder of the transplant workup results were
unremarkable except for a significantly reduced diffusing capacity
of 59% corrected. A creatinine clearance of 48.4 and a PSA of
18.1 , prostate biopsy and bone scan were both negative.
His admission was otherwise notable for an elevated creatinine of
3.0 in the setting of perioperative levofloxacin and gentamicin as
well as aggressive vasodilator therapy. His creatine was back
down to his baseline of low 2's before discharge. Mr. Delullo was
discharged home in stable condition on the following medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 q. day , Lasix 120 b.i.d ,
Coumadin 5 mg q. day , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.
day , Avapro 150 mg q. day , Niferex 150 mg q. day and ranitidine 150
mg b.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: Mr. Feyler will follow-up with Dr. Daniel Marshburn in two
weeks.
