outside hospital reveals the following: 70% left main , 90%
circumflex , 30% LAD , 60% D1 , 40% RCA and a right dominant
circulation.
Echocardiogram from 7/4/05 estimates ejection
fraction at 60% , notes mild aortic insufficiency. EKG normal
sinus rhythm at 83 with ST depressions in V4 and V5 , inverted
T-waves. Chest x-ray is consistent with congestive heart failure
and cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was taken to the operating room on 3/15/05 and
underwent CABG x2 with a Y graft , LIMA connects SVG1 to LAD and
SVG1 connects aorta to OM1. The patient was taken to the
Intensive Care Unit following surgery in stable condition. She
was extubated on her operative day without difficulties and was
hemodynamically stable postoperatively with adequate urine
output. The patient was started on a beta-blocker and was
followed by Diabetes Management Service for glycemic control.
She was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #2
in good condition; neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable , saturating well on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula ,
her diet was advanced and well tolerated. Her urine output was
brisk on diuretics. She was started on aspirin. White blood
cell count was noted to be elevated postoperatively , but the
patient remained afebrile and her white blood cell count trended
down for the remainder of her hospital stay. She was noted to
have a urinary tract infection for which she was treated with
ciprofloxacin and she continued to progress daily with mobility
and ambulation. The remainder of her hospital stay was
uncomplicated and she is discharged to home in good condition on
postoperative day #5. At time of discharge , her laboratory
chemistries include the following: sodium of 134 , potassium of
4.4 , BUN of 26 , creatinine of 0.9. Her white blood cell count has
steadily declined during the postoperative period and her white
blood cell count is 14 at time of discharge. The patient's hematocrit is
stable at 35 , and INR is 1.1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain ,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , atenolol 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , ciprofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.12h. x2 doses , this will
complete 3 days treatment for urinary tract infection , Colace 100
mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation , Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Combivent 2 puffs inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath and
