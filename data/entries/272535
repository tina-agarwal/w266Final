Dr. Brant Ravo 1 week ,
No Known Allergies
ADMIT DIAGNOSIS:
r/o MI
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS ;Responsible After Study for Causing Admission )
CAD , CHF r/o MI , sm. area of inferolat rev. ischemia by adenosine MIBI , EF: 45% LV dilation
OTHER DIAGNOSIS;Conditions , Infections , Complications , affecting Treatment/Stay
hypertension hypercholesterolemia obesity lumbosacral disc degeneration
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )
r/o MI--ruled out
adenosine MIBI part I stress--small amt. inferior/lateral defect seen.
Part II ( resting ) complete 5/19 Sm. amount of rev. ischemia
inferolateral wall , sum stress score: 4 ( 4-8 is mild abnormal test ). On
echo , there is wall motion abnormality in inferolat. area , LV is
dilated ( 120 ) and EF 43%.
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
53 y.o african american woman w/ HTN ,
hypercholesteroleia , morbid obesity presents with 1 month intermittent
chest pressure sometimes associated with sob , diaphoresis.
Pressure sensation became more frequent--once a day for
the past week , and now radiates to left arm. No n/v/f/c/orthopnea/doe.
At baseline , has short walking tolerance. Was late for pot medical center appt.
today-- was sent to ED for r/o. CK 79 , TnI 0.0 and
EKG with t wave inversions v5-6 , inverted P waves v1-2 of unclear
significance. Pt. ruled out for MI by enzymes , and had adenosine mibi
and echo. MIBI showed sm. amt. of inferolateral reversible ischemia ,
sum stress score 4 ( 4-8 mild abnl ) , and on echo , there is hypokinesis
of inferolateral wall. LV is dilated , EF 45%. Etiology of
cardiomyopathy will need to be followed up with cardiologist , and
because the area of reversible ischemia was so small , she will be
medically managed. Pt. started on ACEI , ASA , zocor , atenolol ( 12.5 mg
dose chosen b/c pt. has had HR 64 and pressures in low 100's ) , zantac ,
NGSL prn. She will continue on HCTZ and vioxx usual meds.
Pt. was discharged home 0/6 after the test , and will follow up with
Dr. Tait , will need referral to cardiologist. Also suggest sleep study
given body habitus , snoring , and ?adequate oxygenation.
