BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The pt is a 58 yo man with NIDDM , HTN , elevated
cholesterol , and CRI , who presented to his PCP 6/17 c/o 2D of SS chest
pressure. The patient has had prior admissions for chest pressure
but negative ETT 1998-1999 ( ETT-mibi 1999 with no fixed
or reversible defects , EF 50% ). He reports that
2D ago he developed SS chest pressure with L
arm tingling/pain; episode occured at rest and
lasted 10-15'. He has had a few episodes per day
since , almost all at rest ( the patient went up a
few flights of stairs last night without difficulty ).
Not associated with N/diaphoresis/SOB. Did not change with position.
The pt's wife feels that his sx are similar to his complaints in 1999.
The patient reported a history of "heavy/labored breathing" over past
few weeks , concurrent with some weight gain ( the patient had been
trying to lose weight but "lost his motivation" and
went from 275-&gt;305 2/3 ).
No PND/orthopnea/DOE , + some mild swelling
around ankles. Pt also reports URI sx over past
week with dry cough/stuffiness , no f/c , +
mild nausea. URI sx resolved before chest
pressure episodes began. The pt presented to his
PCP with this complaint and was brought to ED , given
1 SLNTG and pressure resolved. He also
received lopressor 2.5 IV/25 PO and ASA 325.
Home meds included
cardizem/amaryl/prinivil/lipitor/asa/flomax/detrol/
palmitate A. No tob since age 18. +FH early MI. PE in ED: T 96.7 , HR
80 , BP 139/80 , 100% 2L. R eye deviated laterally. Periph field
cut. Chest clear. JVP 7 cm. RRR , I/VI SEM RUSB , obese , nl abd
exam , trace pretibial edema. EKG no change from
prior. 1st set enz flat. Labs Cr 1.4 ( baseline
1.3-1.6 ).
Hospital course:
CV: CAD/ischemia: multiple CRF ,
past negative ETTs , sx unrelated to exertion but
c/w angina otherwise ( pressure/L arm paresthesia ) ,
with no assoc sx. Pt was r/o for MI by serial enz/ekgs. Cardizem was
dc'd and he was started on lopressor and transitioned to atenolol fo
r d/c ( though it was not possible to get an accurate assessment of
BP on lopressor given short stay/nitro paste in house. ) He was
continued on ACE/lipitor. Stress portion of ETT-mibi ( separate from
rest given pt's weight/need for higher doses of marker ): pt walked
for 5'20s , reached DP of 24 , 480. He had no CP or EKG changes and
only small amt SOB at max exertion. Mibi showed a small defect in
the mid-basal portion of the inf-lateral wall , which if reversible
would suggest a small area of ischemia in the OM distribution. It was
decided that the lesion , even if reversible , was of low enough risk
that the patient could go home and return for the rest portion on
Monday. He was dc'd on his adjusted meds as above and will f/u with
Dr. Yao Monday to arrange BP check. Pump: the patient did not s
how evidence of fluid overload on exam , and it was thought that his
inc SOB x 1 mth or more was due to his weight gain , but ECHO was o
btained for baseline study and results were pending at dc.
DM: amaryl held while in house , ISS. microalbumin/Cr ratio was nl at
6.1 , compared to 51 in
7/25 amaryl restarted for d/c.
Renal: Cr at baseline
ID: s/p URI , resolving: ocean spray
GU:
detrol/flomax.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: return to ED if you experience significant chest pain unrelieved by
nitroglycerin.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
