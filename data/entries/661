OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:

OTHER TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES ( NOT IN O.R. )
Persantine and viability cardiac PET scan 5/19/04
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
erate global LV systolic dysfunction.
3. The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study
of February , 2003.
CC: Hypotension after dialysis
HPI: 56 yo male with h/o ESRD , CAD , CHF ( EF 20-25% ) admitted for
hypotension after HD. He was in his USOH until 2 days PTA when he
developed stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. He
denied recent travels , and had remote Abx use. At Stodun Hospital ,
he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his BP was 66/30. 1 liter of
NS was given and his BP rose to 73/40.
ROS: Chronic PND , uses 1 pillow , gained 8kg in 2 weeks but compliant
with meds , no melena , no BRBPR
Physical Exam T 97 p85 BP 114/67-&gt;160/97 rr 16-24 89% RA
Chronically ill appearing , NAD
Neck: Supple
Chest: Bibasilar rales
CVS: palpable S3 , Lat displaced PMI , II/VI SEM at RUSB , JVP &lt; 7cm
Abd: Soft NT ND , + BS , no HSM
Ext: Trace pedal edema , hyperpigmentation in sock distribution
Labs: WBC 5 , TnI 0.37 , CK 153 , CKMB8.2 ( chronically elevated cardiac
enzymes )
EKG: NSR , 1st deg AVB , LAE , LVH , old TWI in 1 , L , V5 , V6 , more pronounced
ST dep in V5 than 6/4
CXR: R pl effusion , CMG
Assessment: Hypotension after dialysis in setting of GI
upset/diarrhea/vomiting , likely was dehydrated. The BP rose after
fluids and his current hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema.
Although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern about
new ishemia , and concern for PE given hypoxia in ED.
Hospital course
1. CVS: Ischemia: NSTEMI: contined medical management with asa , beta
blocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. The CkMB peaked at 12 and Tni to 4. His
cardiologist ( Dr Benisek ) recommended PET scan to assess for viable
myocardium and ischemia. His last stress test 1 year ago showed only
scarring with no ischemia. In the past , pt's wife refused for him to go
for CABG. They are reconsidering this option currently.
The results of the PET scan are as follows:
- A small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mild
residual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal LAD
distribution.
- Moderate global LV systolic dysfunction.
- The results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of February ,
2003.
The family was called to stress the importance of follow up with
cardiology ( They have missed appointments in the past )
Pump: ( EF 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , BNP was sent and
pending and echo revealed EF 30% , Mod AI.
Rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry
2. Pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. RA sats improved to
97%
3. Renal: HD MWF , home renal meds. He was dialyzed to a weight below
his previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. In the past he
has had elevated RH filling pressures after HD. The Ryi was
called by the attendting renal physician ( Dr. Slemp ) about his goal
weight.
4. ID: Blood cx were no growth
5. GI: He was continued on his home nexium
6. Proph: SQ heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It is very important that you attend your follow up appointment with
the cardiologist , Dr Ivrin
Please take the medications listed above and do not take enalapril on
mornings of dialysis
Please adhere to your dietary restrictions. If you gain more than 3 kg
between dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid intake. The diet
guidelines will be coordinated by the staff at Chapmed Gamette Medical Center
