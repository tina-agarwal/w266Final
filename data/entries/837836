Discharge Date: 4/2/1998
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: WIDE COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA POST EXERCISE
TOLERANCE TEST RECOVERY.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1 ) HYPERCOAGULABILITY STATE WITH NEGATIVE SERUM WORK-UP.
2 ) RULE OUT RENAL CELL CARCINOMA ON THE LEFT ( CT PENDING ).
3 ) HISTORY OF PPD POSITIVITY WITH CHEST X-RAY NEGATIVE.
4 ) GOUT.
5 ) CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE STATUS POST UNILATERAL
ORCHIECTOMY.
6 ) HISTORY OF HEPATITIS A.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year old man with
coronary risk factors of hypertension ,
borderline hypercholesterolemia , remote tobacco with a history of
hypercoagulability ( negative work-up for protein C , S , activated
protein C , factor V lydin , antithrombin III , anticardiolipin
antibody , and homocystine level ) , and multiple deep venous
thromboses/pulmonary emboli requiring chronic anticoagulation and
placement of an IVC filter in 7/26 He reportedly had a history
of chronic shortness of breath and negative stress test for
ischemia in 1/5 through 11/7/98. A Holter monitor in 3/0
showed frequent premature ventricular contractions , 21 couplets ,
and no other arrhythmias. An echo in 11/22 showed an ejection
fraction of 55% , left ventricular hypertrophy , mitral valve
prolapse with 2-3+ mitral regurgitation , and trace aortic
insufficiency. A repeat Holter in 2/29 showed numerous premature
ventricular contractions , PM bradycardia , sinus tachycardia , a rate
of 113 , six triplets , and 172 couplets. On a stress test in 2/11 ,
the patient lasted two minutes and stopped secondary to atypical
chest pain with a peak heart rate of 79% of predicted and a peak
blood pressure of 170. There were no signs of definite ischemic
and no clinically significant rhythm disturbance. The patient
reported a vague history of arrhythmia in the Oven
for which he was supposedly due to have a pacemaker placed. He
denied ever being symptomatic with these arrhythmias. Over the
last week , he had reported increasing fatigue and shortness of
breath. The day of admission on his way to the clinic for an INR
check , he reported chest tightness that was different from his
previous pulmonary emboli , apparently 10/10 on presentation though
he denied it after the fact associated with shortness of breath and
fatigue with "heavy heart beats". He denied associated symptoms of
nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , light headedness , and palpitations.
He denied congestive heart failure and syncopal symptoms over the
last few weeks. In the Emergency Room , he had flat CK and a 0
troponin I and a stress test lasting three minutes and fifteen
seconds. Patient stopped secondary to fatigue and not chest pain ,
however , three to five minutes after recovery , he developed a
couple of episodes of nonmonomorphic wide complex tachycardia at a
rate of about 150 lasting twenty to thirty beats during which time
he was reportedly asymptomatic. The patient was admitted for
evaluation of this possible ventricular tachycardia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of multiple pulmonary emboli/deep
venous thromboses with number one in 5/29 ,
status post TPA when echo showed right ventricular strain , number
two in 0/30 , number three in 1/5 after one year of Coumadin , and
number four in 2/23 status post IVC filter placement when patient
bled into left renal cyst with goal INR of 3 to 3.8. Patient had a
negative hypercoagulability work-up , question of renal cell
carcinoma which must be evaluated in the next two months , history
of PPD positivity of 2 cm and negative chest x-ray , mitral valve
prolapse and MR on echo , hypertensive borderline
hypercholesterolemia , gout , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
status post unilateral orchiectomy , restrictive lung disease ,
history of a duplex 5 cm adrenal mass , negative 17
hydroxyketosteroids and VMA , and history of hepatitis A virus.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , amlodipine 10 mg
p.o. q.d. , Cardura 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. , Axid 150
mg p.o. b.i.d. , Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q.d. , and indomethacin q.4h.
ALLERGIES: Patient had no known drug allergies
( hydrochlorothiazide was thought to cause gout
exacerbations and ace inhibitor thought to cause cough , and beta
blocker with urinary retention ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Patient had a family history of cancer and no
history of premature coronary disease ,
palpitations , or sudden death.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient immigrated from the Georgia
with his wife a few years ago , had a remote
history of tobacco , occasional alcohol , and no drugs. He was a
previous factory worker.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 70 year old with a history of
hypertensive borderline hypercholesterolemia , and
hypercoagulability with multiple pulmonary emboli in the past who
presented asymptomatically with a wide complex tachycardia that
could not rule out ventricular tachycardia in the recovery phase of
a full Bruce exercise tolerance test. The patient was admitted for
Holter monitoring times 48 hours. He was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction. He was started on a cholesterol lowering
agent , his Coumadin was held , and Heparin was started in the case
of an invasive procedure. On 10/6/98 , the patient had an exercise
tolerance test MIBI on an increased dose of beta blocker of 50 mg
of Lopressor q.8h. which showed that the patient exercised three
minutes and fifteen seconds stopping secondary to leg pain from his
deep venous thrombosis with a peak heart rate of 106 , peak blood
pressure 150/80 , frequent premature ventricular contractions in
couplets , no ST or T wave changes , and no chest pain. The patient
then had an adenosine MIBI with a maximum heart rate of 81 and a
maximum blood pressure of 180/70. He did have chest pain after the
infusion with T wave inversions in V5 through V6 and occasional
premature ventricular contractions that were consistent with but
not diagnostic of ischemia. The MIBI images showed mild
nonspecific inferior wall changes with some reversibility
suggestive with but not conclusive of ischemia. The patient was
discharged the following day on his usual out-patient medicines
with the addition of an ace inhibitor , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. ,
given his mitral regurgitation. He will continue his beta blocker
at an increased dose , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , in addition to his
Cardura and amlodipine. He was started on Zocor at 10 mg p.o. q.d.
DISPOSITION: He will need out-patient echos to follow his mitral
regurgitation and will need to be observed the higher
risk of developing atrial fibrillation. He will also need a repeat
stress test in the next couple of months when his leg pain
completely resolves. From a hypercoagulability standpoint , his
Coumadin was started at his usual out-patient dose of 6 mg p.o.
q.p.m. with enoxaparin used as a bridge to anticoagulation until
his INR is at least 3. His goal INR is between 3 and 3.8. He will
have visiting nurse teach him to use the enoxaparin and will come
to Coumadin Clinic at SHAVA HEALTHCARE every two to three days to have his INR
level checked. A pelvic CT was scheduled on 8/30/98 at 2 p.m. to
reevaluate his kidneys and rule out renal cell carcinoma.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg
p.o. q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,
amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cardura 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. , nitroglycerin
sublingual tablets 0.4 mg q.5 minutes p.r.n. chest pain ,
indomethacin 25 mg p.o. q.6h. , Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Zocor 10 mg
p.o. q.h.s. , enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously q.12h. until INR 3 ,
and Coumadin 6 mg p.o. q.p.m.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow-up with Dr. Darnell Wanca
next week and was in stable condition upon discharge.
