549169542 | LMC | 37434513 | | 395019 | 2/14/1991 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 0/26/1991 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 5/0/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year old Hispanic
female with insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus and hypertension , who fell at home approximately 1 week
before admission. She suffered a right-sided Colles fracture that
was treated with closed reduction and half cast. Furthermore , she
suffered a nondisplaced left-sided patella fracture , which was
primarily treated with a knee immobilizer. Since the follow-up
x-ray of the distal radius 1 week after trauma showed shortening
and dorsal angulation , the patient was admitted for closed
reduction and external fixation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY reveals
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension , anxiety. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY reveals she is status post open reduction and
internal fixation of a left-sided tibial plateau fracture 9 months
ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION were Verapamil 80 milligrams by
mouth 3 times a day , Chlorthalidone 50 milligrams by mouth per day ,
humulin-N 40 units subcutaneously each morning , multivitamin 1
tablet by mouth per day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a 62 year old
female in no acute distress. Lungs were
clear. Cardiovascular examination showed regular rate and rhythm ,
III/VI holosystolic murmur , regular S1 and S2 , no S3 or S4. Abdomen
was soft , nontender , no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities showed the right forearm and wrist immobilized in a
splint , there was regular VMF of all 5 digits , good capillary
refill , radial and ulnar pulses were 2+/2+. Left knee had positive
effusion , no signs of ligamentous instability , straight leg raising
possible , but with 15 to 20 degree extension deficit.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , x-ray of the left knee , PA
and lateral , shows nondislocated patella
fracture ( fracture line almost not visible ). Distal radius PA and
lateral showed shortening and dorsal angulation of the articulate
surface. On admission , electrolytes were within normal limits ,
blood urea nitrogen 23 , creatinine 1.3 , hemoglobin 13.0 , hematocrit
38.2 , white count 8 , 100 , platelet count 411 , 000 , prothrombin time
12.3 , partial thromboplastin time 23.4. Urinalysis was without
pathological findings.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 30 of April , the patient underwent closed reduction
and external fixation of her distal radial
fracture. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and the
postoperative course was without complications. Postoperative
x-ray control showed an optimal result with anatomical reduction of
the radial articulate surface. During the early postoperative
course , the radial ramus of the radial nerve seemed to be
irritated , but recovered without any further intervention and the
patient was without any neurological deficit from the 4th
postoperative day on. While the left leg was immobilized with a
brace , the patient started to ambulate with a platform walker and
with full weight-bearing on the left leg. Prior to discharge , the
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. Serial electrolytes ,
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal limits.
Leukocytes were 8 , 000 , hemoglobin 12.9 , hematocrit 38.0 , platelet
count 489 , 000 , last blood glucose level prior to discharge from
7:00 am was 169 , 4:00 pm 73 , 10:00 pm 230. The pin sites on the
right forearm were without signs of infection. X-ray control done
on 15 of September , showed unchanged positioning of the right radius , as
well as the left patella.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE are the same as on
admission. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The
patient is going home. The plan is for postoperative FOLLOW-UP in
1 week at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Wyckbastroit Center .
Until then , the patient is advised to keep the right arm elevated
and to seek medical attention in case of fever , reddening of the
pin sites , and/or secretion from any pin site. Hence , the patient
is not able to do her finger sticks for blood sugar measurement by
herself , and Visiting Nurse Association was ordered.
