BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
--HPI: Mr. Gump is a 77yo African American male with PMH notable for COPD ,
HTN , NIDDM and recent PNA who presented to SHH ED on 7/26/05 via EMS with a
CC of SOB x 3d. He was seen 2 days earlier at the Dis.ry Medical Center where he
was diagosed with pneumonia and given Azithromycin. The day of admissio
he said his breathing felt more labored and he contacted EMS to take him to
the CHA ED. He also reported worsening exercise tolerance and an increase
in bilateral lower extremity edema over the past few months , accompanied by
a 20lb weight gain. He also noted left sided pleuritic pain made worse by
physical movement and deep breathing. He was treated in the ED with
supplemental O2 and Levofloxacin and admitted with a diagnosis of COPD flare
and right heart failure.

--PE upon admission: afebrile , P 101 , R 28 , BP 150/70 , O2 sat 99% 2L NC
Pulm- labored breathing , accessory muscle use , rhonchi and expiratory
wheezes present throughout both lung fields. egophony in LLL.
CV- normal PMI , no RV heave. RRR. Unable to appreciate heart sounds. weak
peripheral pulses. 12cm JVD.
Abd- +BS , nontender , nondistended. hepatomegaly.
Ext- 2+ bilateral pitting edema.
Neuro- AAOx3. CN intact. strength 5/5 , symmetric. unable to elicit
reflexes.
--Sig labs and tests upon admission: BUN 17 , Cr 1.4 , Glucose 179. WBC 8.7 ,
Hct 38 , MCV 84. LFTs normal. Albumin 4.3 , Amylast 83 , Lipase 33. Cardiac
enzymes- negative.
CXR showed old RLL infiltrate unchanged from previous tests.
ECG demonstrated nonspecific ST changes unchanged from previous tests.
--Hospital course:
1. ) Pulm- Pt treated for COPD flare with supplemental O2 , DuoNebs , and
steroids. Since he reported left sided pleuritic chest pain , we evaluated
the possibility of PE with a V/Q scan that reported a low probability of PE.
2. ) CV- Pt's physical exam demonstrated signs of right-sided heart failure ,
notably 12 cm JVD , hepatomegaly and later hepatojugular reflex , and 2+
bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. We proceeded to treat his heart
failure by diuresis with Lasix , initially PO and then IV. Overall , he
diuresed approximately 1L fluid. To further evaluate his heart failure , a
cardiac MRI was obtained and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and
function. His LVEF was 73% and he had no valvular dysfunction.
3. ) ID- Sputum was cultured which showed few polys , moderate cocci , 2+
suspected oral flora. Since he remained afebrile and did not demonstrate an
elevated WBC , we did not treat with antibiotics.
4. ) Endo- His diabetes was managed with his home regimen of Novolog.
Steroids may have contributed to his elevated blood sugars. In a previous
discharge summary , it was noted that he had an elevated TSH level. We
followed up on this by rechecking his TSH , which was normal.
5. ) Renal- He an elevated baseline level of Cr. We monitored his Cr and
BUN for an increase with diuresis. While the BUN increased to the low 30s ,
his Cr was stable.
6. ) Prophylaxis- Chronic pain and insomnia were managed with his out-pt
regimen of morphine and oxycodone. He was given Elavil for sleep. Because
of his history of cancer , he was placed on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please use your home oxygen when you are sleeping at night. We have added
combivent inhalers and a steroid taper to your medicines. Please stop the
hydrochlorathiazide ( hctz ) 25mg. Instead you will be taking lasix 20mg
once a day.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
- Continue Lasix 40mg PO QD at home and D/C home HTCZ.
- Slow Prednisone taper over next 20 days.
- Have PCP address management of HTN medications and OSA. Check lytes on
new dose of lasix. Consider adding ACE inhibitor considering hx of NIDDM.
Episodic hypoxia while sleeping may contribute to pulmonary HTN and signs
of right heart failure observed.
No dictated summary
