and abates with rest. She also reports dyspnea on exertion over
the same time period.

once a day , lisinopril 40 mg once a day , atenolol 50 mg once a
day , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day , allopurinol 200 mg
once a day , Fosamax 70 mg once a week , glyburide 2.5 mg twice a
day , metformin 500 mg twice a day , multivitamin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease in her
father and brother; also significant for diabetes and
hypertension. Uterine cancer in her mother.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a 40-pack-year smoking history
and quit in 1991. She reports occasional alcohol use. She is
single. Worked as a secretary and lives in assisted living.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs on admission: Temperature
97.1 , heart rate 63 , blood pressure 120/58 , respiratory rate 20 ,
satting 98% on 2 liters. Physical examination significant for:
Jugular venous pulse at 6 cm , bilateral carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular: S1 S2 , normal regular rate and rhythm , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops , PMI nondisplaced , no right ventricular
heave. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen:
Soft , nontender , nondistended with good bowel sounds.
Extremities: Warm and well perfused with no peripheral edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Troponin of 0.29. EKG revealed new Q waves
anteriorly.
STUDIES:
Cardiac MRI , 7/9/2005 , revealed scar tissue in the
mid-to-distal LAD region.
Left heart catheterization , 5/22/2005 , revealed severe
three-vessel disease with 50% to 60% stenosis of LM , 95% stenosis
of LAD , a tight calcified RCA and OM1.
Cardiac echo , 5/22/2005 , ejection fraction of 35% to 40% , septal
hypokinesis , mild mitral regurgitation.
Stress MIBI with PET viability , 7/16/2005 , revealed viable
myocardium.
PROCEDURES: Carotid duplex study , 7/16/2005 : Showed no
significant disease of the carotid arteries.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia-The patient had a stable anginal
pattern , but had new Q waves in the anterior leads and a troponin
leak. She was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction and continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , and initially
on heparin drip. The cardiac catheterization showed severe
three-vessel disease and a question of viable myocardium. A
stress MIBI with PET viability on 7/16/2005 showed viable
myocardium; however , cardiac MRI with gadolinium showed scarred
tissue in the LAD territory. A CT Surgery consult was obtained
to consider CABG versus PCI. After reviewing the radiology
studies , it was determined that the patient would benefit from a
CABG. She was on a schedule to have CABG during this admission;
however , due to scheduling constraints , will be discharged home
and then return to the hospital , 10/29/2005 , for CABG to be
performed by Dr. Kernan Her cardiac enzymes trended down during
the admission. She will be discharged with a prescription for
nitroglycerin sublingually as needed for chest pain and
instructed to call her physician/911 , if she experiences any
chest pain. Pump - an echocardiogram on 5/22/2005 revealed an
ejection fraction of 35% to 40%. The patient was euvolemic on
her exam. She continued on her lisinopril , Imdur , Lopressor
while in-house.
2. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
The patient's oral hypoglycemic medications were held during the
admission and she was given standing NPH insulin , standing
prandial NovoLog with scale coverage. She will be discharged
home on her glyburide and Avandia. Her metformin will be held
given her increased creatinine upon admission.
3. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of 1.4 on admission.
Her fractional excretion of sodium was calculated to be 0.45% ,
and she was thought to be prerenal. Prior to discharge , her
creatinine normalized to 1.1.
4. FEN: The patient tolerated a low-sodium , no-caffeine diet.
5. Psychiatry: The patient continued on her amitriptyline for a
history of depression.
6. Medication changes: The patient will not continue on her
Norvasc and metformin. She will continue on her aspirin ,
lisinopril , hydrochlorothiazide , allopurinol , Fosamax ,
multivitamin , and amitriptyline. She will start on Imdur ,
high-dose Lipitor and Avandia. Her glyburide was changed to
once-a-day dosing , and her atenolol was changed to Toprol-XL 75
mg p.o. once a day.
TO DO/PLAN: The patient was instructed to return to the hospital
if she experienced any chest pain , shortness of breath , worsening
leg swelling , nausea , vomiting , sweating or fevers. The patient
will return to the hospital on 10/29/2005 for CABG with Dr.
Moton She is also scheduled for a followup appointment with
Dr. Talamantez , 572-872-3151 on 10/16/2005 at 4:40 p.m. The patient
was instructed to return to the hospital two hours before her
scheduled surgery on 5/12/2005.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once a day ,
allopurinol 200 mg p.o. once a day , amitriptyline 5 mg p.o. once
every evening , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. once a day ,
lisinopril 40 mg p.o. once a day , magnesium gluconate 500 mg p.o.
twice a day , Imdur 30 mg p.o. once a day , Fosamax 70 mg p.o. once
a week , Lipitor 80 mg p.o. once a day , Toprol-XL 75 mg p.o. once
