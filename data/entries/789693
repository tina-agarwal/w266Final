Hospital Course:
57 yo F with complex medical history here with mental status
change likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy with some component of
medication-induced delirium ( from opiates ).
++Mental Status - Avoided increasing narcotics. Given lactulose QID.
Mental status improved significantly in first 24 hours of
hospitalization. Patient then remained at her baseline mental status for
rest of hospital stay.
++MSK - Patient has history of chronic low back pain that is
likely related to bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures seen on MRI on
5/1/06. We avoided increasing her narcotic dose for concern of her
altered mental status. Pain was controlled effectively with MSIR prn ,
celecoxib daily prn ( should not increase to bid given ? increase risk of
cardiac side effects ) , and a lidoderm patch over her lower back. Other
NSAIDS were avoided given h/o GI bleed. Patient is scheduled to f/u with
Dr. Stayner ( Rheumatology ) for management of her back pain and
consideration of sacroplasty. Patient should be seen by PT at her nursing
home to help her with her walking.
++GI/ID - Had low-grade fevers overnight on HD 1 and 2. Patient had mild
RUQ tenderness which raised a question of possible GI / biliary source of
infection. Blood cultures were positive for coag negative staph in 2/4
bottles. She was treated with Ciprofloxacin and
Metronidazol starting on HD 1 , and vancomycin until speciation of blood
cultures. Blood cultures repeated on 2/3 and 9/5
were negative to date. Coag neg staph blood cultures were thought to be
due to contamination. Patient has remained afebrile and abdominal
tenderness has resolved over hospital stay. Vancomycin was discontinued
on HD 3 and Cipro and Flagyl were continued. She was discharged with
instructions to complete a 14-day course of Cipro and Flagyl. Her WBC
count and platelets decreased gradually throughout her hospital stay and
were 3.88 and 122 respectively. A CBC should be checked on Monday 3/21 to
make sure that she is not becoming neutropenic or thrombocytopenic.
++Pulm - The possibility of PE was considered given lower extremity
swelling and her change in mental status. Given that she was at her
baseline oxygen requirement and had negative LENIs , PE was thought to be
low probability. She remained at her baseline oxygen saturation ( 93-98%
on room air ) for the duration of her hospitalization. Given flovent for
known COPD.
++CV - EKG at admission was unchanged from previous EKGs. Patient's dose
of Lopressor was decreased , given her low BP at time of admission. Her
heart rate and blood pressure remained in the normal range throughout her
admission.
++Endo: MRI read from 0/12/06 showed evidence of osteoporosis. Started
caltrate , vit D. Unable to give fosamax because of history of esophageal
varices. Giving zometa x 1. Corrected calcium was normal. Will need to
re-check calcium in 1 week.
++FEN - Given thiamine , folate , fluids , Is/Os , weights.
++PPX - Lovenox , nexium , aspiration precautions.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You are being discharged from the hospital to your nursing home in
Smerfortn Blvd , Stin with a few changes in your medications. We have changed your pain
medication to MSIR every 4 hr as needed , celebrex , and lidoderm patch.
Please call your doctor if you are feeling that your thinking is not
clear or if you start to have fevers. And please return to the emergency
department if you are having increased abdominal pain , chest pain ,
difficulty breathing , or other concerning symptoms. You should have your
blood counts checked on Monday and your calcium checked next week.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Follow up with Dr. Vargas at next available appointment. Please call Dr.
Megeath office to schedule. Follow up with Dr. Blandin and Dr. Pfleider
as scheduled. Patient should be seen by physical therapy at her nursing
home. Patient should have a CBC drawn on Monday 3/21 to check her white
count and platements , which were trending down slowly throughout her
admission and recheck calcium ( corrected for albumin ) in one week.
