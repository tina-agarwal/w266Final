Discharge Date: 8/14/2006
ATTENDING: HAJDUK , COLUMBUS MD
DATE AND TIME OF DEATH: 10/18/06 at 2:20 p.m.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient was admitted on 0/5/06 with a
chief complaint of weakness and confusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This was a 70-year-old female with
CHF , coronary artery disease , diabetes , peripheral vascular
disease , and chronic renal insufficiency that was admitted on
0/5/06 for weakness and confusion. She had been recently
hospitalized on 8/1/06 through 9/11/06 and 5/6/06 through
5/24/06 for CHF exacerbation requiring aggressive diuresis.
Her weight on discharge on 5/24/06 was 85 kg. She did well
initially at home after discharge , but two days prior to
admission , had increasing somnolence and confusion with global
weakness causing the patient to fall without head trauma or loss
of consciousness. The patient had decreased p.o. intake and was
febrile to 99.5. On admission , her weight was 83.9 kg. She was
hypotensive with blood pressures of 100/50. Her JVP was elevated to
15 and 3+ pitting edema. She had a BNP of 2321 and a white cell
count of 18.9.
Assessment: An assessment on admission suggested that the
patient possibly had hypoperfusion secondary to over diuresis or
worsening heart failure secondary to a cardiac event with a note
of having a troponin of 2.61.
Hospital Course: Her hospital course after admission on 0/5/06 was
complicated by worsening cardiac function with minimal improvement on milrinone
and decreasing urine output despite diuretics and also gross gastrointestinal
bleeding with melanotic stool while she was on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation. In addition , there was concern for sepsis. The patient was on
antibiotics with levofloxacin , Flagyl , and vancomycin. She required a transfer
to the Cardiac Care Unit on 9/15/06 for further medical therapy for poor
cardiac output , a
possible need for CVVH , given volume overload in the setting of renal failure ,
and work-up of GIB. Her code status was DNR/DNI during her admission into the
CCU on 9/23/06. The patient reversed her status to DNR , but allowed for
elective intubation on 9/15/06 , given her increasing GI bleed and the
worsening renal failure. The patient was electively intubated on 5/27/06
without any complications. For her GI bleed , she had an EGD and colonoscopy ,
which found a
gross large ascending colorectal mass with ulcerations , which likely
contributed to her gross GI bleed. Given the patient's wishes to
be DNR/DNI and given her new finding for a large mass in the
ascending colon , the patient's code status was changed to comfort
measures only on 1/17/06. In addition , her colorectal mass pathology returned
showing poorly differentiated tumor with lymphoma versus adenocarcinoma being
most likely as the diagnosis. For the above reason , the patient was also made
CMO.
Being CMO status , she was removed of all pressors and
antibiotics in the morning of 1/17/06. She was made comfortable sedated on
fentanyl and Versed. She was then extubated for comfort with family present.
She had agonal breathing with episodes of apnea and was given additional
sedation for comfort. The patient drew her last breath at 2:20 p.m. Her
family was present at bedside. The attending was aware.
On assessment , the patient had no spontaneous breathing , no corneal reflex ,
and no peripheral pulses. The patient's eyes were dilated and no heart
sounds or breath sounds were appreciated. Given the CMO status ,
no CPR was undertaken. The patient was pronounced dead at 2:20
p.m. on 1/17/06. Family declined autopsy.
