ATTENDING: MCENTEGART , JOSE M.D.
SERVICE: Ho Ment Ton
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Cardiomyopathy , coronary artery disease.
PROBLEM LIST AND DIAGNOSIS:
1. Morbid obesity.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old woman
with morbid obesity ( greater than 330 pounds ) , hypertension ,
diabetes mellitus who presents with one week of increasing
dyspnea on exertion. She notes that she can no longer walk from
room to room without resting and she used to be able to walk
around her house. She also notes a frequent need to "get air"
which also wakes her from sleep. She often opens the window ,
turns on the air conditioning , etc. when she feels short of
breath. She started sleeping on two pillows over the past few
weeks. She also reports an intermittent increase in her leg
swelling and a cough productive of scant clear to whitish sputum.
She was unable to name her home medications , but stated that she
took four medications plus insulin which is in accordance with
her LMR notes. She has not been able to check her fingerstick
blood glucose levels recently because her machine has been
broken. She denies chest pain , tightness except with coughing.
She denies pleuritic pain , any recent illness , any sick contacts ,
any change in urinary or bowel habits , any nausea or vomiting ,
night sweats , diaphoresis or pain in her jaw or arms. Of note ,
her GIES HEALTH primary care physician , Dr. Miquel Crayford , note from
July 2004 noted tachycardia greater than 100 with decreased
exercise tolerance , inability to lie flat , and snoring and
daytime sleepiness. At this time , an echocardiogram performed in
March 2004 revealed an EF of 60 to 65% , trace PR and no regional
wall motion abnormality.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension. Bilateral
DVTs in 1972. The patient is not currently on anticoagulation.
She was on Coumadin for one year following this event.
Dysfunctional vaginal bleeding. Fibroids. Type II diabetes
mellitus. Morbid obesity. Pituitary microadenoma.
HOME MEDICATIONS: ( Per LMR - the patient confirms these as best
she can recollect ).
1. HCTZ 25 mg daily.
2. Glucophage 500 mg PO b.i.d.
3. NPH insulin 60 q.a.m. , 20 q.p.m.
4. Lisinopril 40 mg.
5. Iron supplements.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies tobacco use , alcohol use ,
drugs. She lives with her daughter who is one of her four
children , and eight of her 14 grandchildren in Otteba
She does not work.
FAMILY HISTORY: Hypertension , diabetes mellitus. No known MI's.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.8. Heart rate
137 , down to 98 with 5 mg of IV Lopressor in the Emergency
Department. Blood pressure 156/98 , satting 95% on room air. In
general , the patient is an obese , pleasant woman in no apparent
distress. HEENT: Extraocular muscles are intact. Mucous
membranes moist. No JVD. Cardiovascular exam reveals
tachycardia , S1 , S2. No murmurs , rubs or gallops but heart
sounds are distant and difficult to assess. Lungs: Decreased
breath sounds throughout secondary to body habitus , but no
crackles or wheeze noted. Abdomen: Soft , nontender ,
nondistended. Extremities warm and well perfused. Bilateral
pitting edema to shins. Derm: No ulcers or lesions.
Hyperpigmentation noted around neck and under breasts. GU exam:
Very trace guaiac positive stool.
ADMISSION LABORATORY RESULTS: Notable for a blood glucose of
190 , BNP of 271 , and hematocrit of 32. ??_____?? EKG: Sinus
tachycardia at 118 with no ST or T-wave abnormalities. Chest
x-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema. No
infiltrate. PE protocol CT ruled out central PE and showed a
small right pleural effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient had cycled electrocardiograms and
biomarkers. These were negative for myocardial ischemia or any
acute change. The patient was maintained on aspirin , Lipitor 80
mg , beta-blocker , and ACE inhibitor. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization on 1/14/05 which revealed a 50% LAD
lesion , a 70% D1 lesion. These lesions were not intervened upon
at the time of dictation. This patient is awaiting viability
study.
Pump: The patient underwent echocardiography on 2/18/05. The
findings of that study were very concerning revealing ejection
fraction of 20 to 25% , sharply decreased from EF of 60 to 65% in
March 2004. In addition , the study revealed global hypokinesis
with septal akinesis.
Rhythm: The patient has remained tachycardic and has been
monitored on tele with no noted abnormalities. On the night of
1/14/05 following cardiac catheterization , the patient had a 13
beat run of nonsustained V. tach on telemetry. She received
electrolyte optimization and close monitoring. Following this
episode , the patient's cycled cardiac biomarkers revealed a
troponin of 7.25 , MB fraction of 31 , CK of 283. As noted above ,
she will undergo cardiac viability study on 0/5/05 and may
receive evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
2. Pulmonary: The patient's initial presentation was suspicious
for pulmonary embolism given her distant past medical history of
DVT's. However , when she was admitted , she exhibited only
tachycardia without evidence of tachypnea or hypoxia and her
clinical course thus far , as well as her PE protocol CT is not
suggestive of this diagnosis. She has had a minimal oxygen
requirement over the course of her hospital stay. She does
experience dyspnea on exertion , however , has not been hypoxic at
any point.
3. Endocrine: TSH was normal. The patient was continued on her
oral hypoglycemic as well as an adjusted insulin regimen which
will be further altered prior to the patient's discharge. In
addition , she will be discharged with a prescription for a new
blood glucose monitor. Her last hemoglobin A1c check was close
to 12. Given her concerning findings of coronary artery disease ,
she will need to maintain much tighter control of her blood
glucose in the future. At the time of dictation , the patient is
being maintained on scheduled NPH as well as regular insulin
sliding scale.
4. Hematologic: Baseline anemia with admission hematocrit
improved from prior infectious diseases. The patient's
productive cough was thought to be not due to infection. The
patient has remained afebrile with normal white blood cell count
over the course of her hospital stay.
The remainder of this patient's hospital course and her discharge
medications will be dictated in a future addendum.
