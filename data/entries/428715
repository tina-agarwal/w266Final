Discharge Date: 6/18/2004
ATTENDING: RAYMUNDO RODRIUEZ MD
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with the last FEV1 of 0.42 ,
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately
40% , who was transferred from Bradpark Hospital for continued
treatment for worsening shortness of breath. The patient reports
that one week prior to her admission to the Daspe I Health ,
two days before transfer to the Ordma Medical Center , the
patient felt more dyspneic on exertion. She noted that she is
having a hard time even getting to the bathroom. Ordinarily , at
home , her baseline using 1.5 liters of oxygen at rest , but able
to get around the house and upstairs. She went to Lahorn Mulg Medical Center on Sunday. She reports that she had a dry cough without
any sputum production. No fever or chills. No sick contacts.
No hemoptysis. No runny nose or sore throat. This is different
from her usual COPD excerebration , in which it is no longer
proceeded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection.
In addition , the history reveals that the patient usually uses
two pillows to sleep , but recently had been using two pillows
folded and felt short of breath if she lay down more than that.
She would wakeup in the middle of the night when she was short of
breath , but there was no change in that symptom over the previous
months.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has gained 15 pounds in one year
prior to admission. She believes that it was due to previous
steroid use. She also notes that she had some diarrhea that was
"like pudding" 1-3 times per day. Not watery , not bloody , and
not black. No recent antibiotic use.
ALLERGIES: The patient has an allergy to aminophyllin. She has
hypotension and arrhythmias from that. She has a reaction to
beta-blockers in which she has worsening breathing.

10. Lasix 40-60 mg each morning , which the patient had not been
taking because it made her pee too much.
11. Atrovent inhaler.
12. Ritalin 5 mg every morning and at lunch , although she does
not feel that it was benefiting her.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature was 96.4 degrees
Fahrenheit , heart rate was 120 and regular , blood pressure was
142/60 , respiratory rate was 24 , and sating 95% on 2 liters of
nasal cannula. General: The patient was talking 2-3 words at a
time. She cannot speak in full sentences. She is using
accessory muscles for breathing. Her jugular venous pressure was
elevated , but with significant respiratory phasic variation. The
patient's hand veins also revealed an increased venous pressure.
The patient had no pallor and no jaundice. Her extraocular
motions were intact. Her pupils were equal and reactive to
light. The patient's oropharynx revealed thrush on the tongue.
Chest exam: There were decreased breath sounds. They were soft
and expiratory wheezes at the bases. No crackles and no rhonchi.
Cardiovascularly , the rhythm was regular , tachycardiac , with a
1-2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. The abdomen was soft , ,
nontender , and nondistended. There were bowel sounds.
Extremities: There was no edema , nontender. Symmetric
extremities. No clubbing.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband of 43 years.
They have no children. The patient has not used tobacco since
1984. She has occasional alcohol use. She notes that she drinks
one drink every month approximately.
At the outside hospital the patient's labs were as follows. Her
white count was 12 with 75% neutrophils , 3 eosinophils , and 6-12
bands forms. Hematocrit was 45. Her platelet count was 290 , 000.
Her PTT was 42. Her INR was 2.2. Her Chem-7 and her sodium was
139. Her potassium was 4.5. Her chloride 101 and bicarbonate
was 31 and BUN was 20. Her creatine was 1.1. Her glucose was
118. Her total protein was 7.7 with an albumin of 4.2 , AST of
29 , ALT of 43 , and alkaline phosphatase of 104. Total bilirubin
is 0.3. Her pH was 7.38 with the carbon dioxide of 54 and an
oxygen of 37 on 20% FiO2 , which is ambient air. This was noted
to be an arterial blood gas. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia at
120 beats per minutes. QRS width was approximately 120
milliseconds in a left bundle branch pattern with normal axis.
No left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. She had 1-2 mm
ST-depression in 2 , 3 and AVF with T-wave inversions in those
leads , also T-wave inversions with 1 mm ST depression in V5 and
V6. The only change from the March , 2004 , EKG is that of
T-wave inversion in V5 , otherwise stable.
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was thought to
be a 60-year-old woman with severe COPD and CHF , who presented
with worsening shortness of breath consistent with a COPD
excerebration. However , this was unlike many of her previous
exacerbations in that she did not experience any upper
respiratory tract infection , and in addition , her jugular venous
pressure was elevated , so it was considered that she might be
having a congestive heart failure exacerbation , as well.
1. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation ,
with prednisone 60 mg by mouth each morning , Atrovent and
albuterol nebulizers q.4h. and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers
as needed. She was also continued on levofloxacin. Initially ,
the patient received 500 mg of levofloxacin a day. As her renal
function worsened that was changed to 150 mg a day and when her
renal function improved again her levofloxacin was once again
increased to 500 mg a day. This should be continued for a 10-day
course. There is little concern for pulmonary embolism , given
the patient's elevated INR. However , she did have a decreased O2
saturation and her CO2 was not very elevated at the outside
hospital. A D-dimer was sent which was less than 200 , which is
negative , suggestive very highly for a pulmonary embolism. The
patient's pulmonary status improved throughout her stay , and by
March , 2004 , she was sating in the 90% range on 2 liters nasal
cannula , almost at baseline. It was thought by the physical
therapy that the patient would benefit from further pulmonary
rehabilitation. As this dictation is being done , the plan is for
her either to go to pulmonary rehabilitation or to stay at the
hospital until she is fully ready and safe to go home , and is not
at an increased fall risk given her severe osteoporosis.
2. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump: Initially , the patient was thought to possibly be
volume overloaded given the fact that she was not taking her
Lasix and that her JVP appeared elevated. In addition , there was
some question whether she might has been having increasing
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or at least orthopnea. She was
initially diuresed aggressively with 60 mg of IV Lasix , two
times. However , lab results suggested that congestive heart
failure was not a large part of her presentation. First , the
brain natriuretic peptide that was sent , showed a value of
proximally 134 , which is approximately a baseline of 141 ,
suggesting that she was not having an acute exacerbation of her
heart failure. In addition , the patient's creatinine increased
from her outside hospital value of 1.0. When it was first
checked at 1:00 in the morning on March , 2004 , at Clinchau Hospital , it was 1.7. She received her two doses of
Lasix , one on the night of June , 2004 , and then again in the
morning of March , 2004. Her creatinine in the afternoon of January , 2004 , increased to 2.2. Urine electrolytes were sent and the
acute renal failure workup will be discussed below under the
renal section. In terms of her heart failure , the patient was
given IV fluids and did not have any further symptoms of heart
failure. Her normal dose of 40 mg of Lasix p.o. every morning
was restarted on July , 2004 , and she will be continued on that
dose.
B. Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry and after her
sinus tachycardia her heart rate came down as her hyperoxemia
improved and she had no further issues.
C. Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin HMG-COA
reductase inhibitor. She was continued on her folic acid , as
well. She was not put on a beta-blocker given her bronchospastic
response to that , but she was continued on her angiotensin
receptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolved.
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.0
from the outside hospital and 1.71 when she first presented. Her
baseline is in the low 1's; 1.0-1.5 as her baseline. The peak
creatinine during her stay was March , 2004 , at 5:00 p.m. and it
was 2.2. Her BUN at that time was 55. Urine electrolytes were
sent , which showed a urine sodium of 39 , and creatinine of 137 ,
and that was only 12 hours after the patient got her last dose of
Lasix. It was felt that the patient had prerenal azotemia and
was given IV fluids. Her creatinine improved , and on March ,
2004 , the patient's creatinine was 1.3 , approximately her
baseline. Her BUN at that time was 30 , increased from 23 on May , 2004. The patient will be monitored as an outpatient to make
sure that her Lasix dose is not too high.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient's creatine kinase was elevated
on admission to 574. It was rechecked on May , 2004 , and it
was 1967. It was felt that this was due to two factors.
Increased release from the muscle , as the patient's MB-fraction
was only 33.5 , which was less than 5% and the troponin was
negative. So this was felt to be due to her increased work of
breathing and release from the muscle and exacerbated by her
acute renal failure and retention of the creatine kinase. Her
creatine kinase decreased by August , 2004 , to 1195. Therefore ,
it was not felt that the patient had rhabdomyolysis causing renal
failure , but rather renal failure causing retention of creatine
kinase disease from increased work of breathing.
5. Hematology: The patient was continued on her Coumadin. The
patient's INR throughout her stay remained therapeutic between
2.4 and 2.6. On March , 2004 , it was 2.5. She was continued on
her home dose. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated
at admission at the outside hospital with a left shift. She was
started on levofloxacin and steroids. Therefore , it is difficult
to interpret her white count deferential. Her white count
remained elevated between 15 and 20 throughout her stay. Her
neutrophil count remained between 70 and 78% of that. A
urinalysis was sent , which did not suggest that the patient had a
urinary tract infection.
6. The patient's TSH was 0.46 with a normal T4 of 7.8. She will
be followed up as an outpatient , as this may represent
subclinical hyperthyroidism. In addition to her thyroid , the
patient's osteoporosis was continued to be treated with calcium
carbonate , vitamin D , and Fosamax during her stay.
7. Rheumatology: The patient was continued on her probenecid
250 mg two times a day. She has no symptoms of gout.
8. Psychiatry: The patient was continued on her clonazepam and
Celexa. She was not continued on Ritalin and will not be
discharged on her Ritalin given her tachycardia. In addition ,
the patient did not feel that the Ritalin was helping her.
9. Pain. The patient's Vioxx was discontinued because of her
renal issues. This will also not be one of her discharge
medications and it should be reassessed by her primary care
doctor. The benefits may outweigh the risks , but this should be
up to Dr. Satterfield , who has a long-term relationship with the
patient.
10. Infectious disease: The patient had blood cultures sent ,
which were negative. At admission , in addition , her urinalysis
showed many red blood cells. It did have some white blood cells
and leucocyte esterase. This is most likely just because the
patient had bleeding , secondary to her Foley catheter.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please use the patient's discharge sheet
for discharge medications.
