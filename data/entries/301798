BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
47 y/o female c h/o HTN , depression , substance abuse , presented to ED
on 5/6/01 c complaints of rapid heart beat , palpitations , and chest
heaviness/pain radiating to left arm. Symptoms progressed to left-sided
weakness/ heaviness and sensory loss. In ED , pt. found to be in afib c
RVR , rate controlled c Diltiazem IV. CT/CTA showed question of a clot
in M2 vessel , therefore Heparinized and transferred to Or Van Sa for acute
stroke care. TTE showed LVH , mild LAE , no thrombus. EKG's c afib , LVH ,
ST/T wave changes c/w strain pattern. CPK's , troponin flat. MRI
showed very small white matter changes in right hemisphere not felt to
be clinically significant ( no evidence for acute stroke ). Neurologic
defecitcharacterized by left hemiparesis and hemianopsia in ED ,
over time evolved into left eye blurriness/decreased vision , left
facial numbness ( no droop ) , right arm and leg numbness and weakness.
Above exam felt to be inconsistent with single lesion , opinion of psych
and neurology was that the above symptoms represented psychogenic
augmentation of an initial real neuro defecit from TIA/small embolic
stroke which recanalized. Transferred to floor on 9/4/01 in afib c
rate in 90's on Digoxin and Lopressor. Started on Coumadin that night ,
Heparin continued at therapeutic range until initiation of Lovenox on
hosp. day # 6. Spontaneously converted to NSR on Lopressor 100 mg PO
tid on 0/24/01 , Lopressor decreased to 50 po tid secondary to sinus
bradycardia , then converted to Atenolol 25 mg PO qd for once
daily dosing. Neurologic deficit spontaneously resolved overnight on
0/24/01 .  On exam , only subtle weakness detected on left arm and finger
extention , numbness completely resolved. Patient will be discharged to
home in stable condition with instructions to follow up with PCP in 1-2
weeks and with Dr. Lapine in 4-6 weeks. Coumadin titration will be
carried out by INMC Fort A Sas office. VNA sercices will carry out
Lovenox administration/education. Plan is for 4-6 weeks of therapeutic
anticoagulation on Coumadin , then reassess need if still in NSR.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You should call Dr. Sphon office tomorrow morning for an appt. this
week. You will have VNA come to your home this evening for Lovenox shot
administration/education. You should take Coumadin as well for the next
month as directed by your doctor. You will need to have blood drawn
