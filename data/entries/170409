Discharge Date: 7/8/2000
SERVICE: CARDIAC SURGERY.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 57-year-old black male with a
history of hypertension and coronary artery disease
admitted 13 of July with episodes of chest pain. In August 1993 ,
the patient presented with a lateral wall myocardial infarction and
was treated with angioplasty of the ramus branch. His course was
complicated by severe hypertension and pulmonary edema. Preserved
left ventricular function with mitral regurgitation were noted. He
presented again in March 1996 with recurrent pulmonary edema in
the setting of non-compliance and extreme hypertension. The
cardiac catheterization was remarkable for a 70% occlusion of the
mid-left anterior descending artery , an 80% of the diagonal 1 , an
occluded ramus , a 70% of the obtuse marginal 1 , diffuse disease of
the right coronary artery with a 70% at the posterior descending
origin , moderate mitral regurgitation , and preserved ejection
fraction. A coronary artery bypass graft was recommended but
refused at the time , and the patient was treated medically. In the
interval , the patient has had intermittent compliance with
medications. Over the last month , he has had calf claudication at
two to three city blocks , sometimes followed by chest pain. He
presented to the Emergency Room on March , 2000 , and on the
standard Bruce exercise tolerance test , went 5.9 and stopped with
right leg pain and chest pain. The EKG showed ST elevations in
leads V1-4. The patient was given aspirin and nitroglycerin. He
refused admission and further work-up. He again presented
13 of July after a walk in the park and incidentally noted markedly
elevated blood pressure , followed by chest pain. He came to the
Emergency Room. He had not taken his medications that morning.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: The home medications included
lisinopril , Lipitor , Imdur , labetalol ,
and aspirin.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Sleep apnea , CPAP-intolerant; hypertension.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Alcohol abuse. He has used one-half to one
pack per day of tobacco since age 18. No alcohol
for the last ten years. The patient is married with grown
children. He is on disability.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , the patient is a
middle-aged black male in no acute distress. The blood pressure is
128/88 in the right arm , 126/76 in the left arm , the pulse 80 with
low upstrokes , brisk , without bruits. The oropharynx is clear.
The thyroid is not palpable. The lungs are clear. An S4 is heard
as well as a faint systolic murmur at the apex. The abdomen is
unremarkable without bruit. There is a 1+ right femoral pulse with
a bruit. The left femoral pulse is 2+. The distal pulses are
normal on the left and diminished on the right. There is no edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: A coronary catheterization 1 of May showed
left ventricular anterior basilar hypokinesis and
1+ mitral regurgitation. The left main coronary artery was okay.
The left anterior descending showed serial proximal 90% and 80%
stenoses. The circumflex obtuse marginal 1 showed a mid-70% and
distal 80%. The right coronary artery showed a mid-99% and a
distal serial 80%-70%. A renal angiogram showed a right femoral
artery stenosis at 4-5 cm proximal to the femoral head.
On 28 of September , the patient had an operative procedure , a
three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal
mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts. The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on Tcin Green , Oregon 48389 He was then
transferred to the Step-Down Unit on postoperative day 1. A
Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained for the right femoral
artery stenosis. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed on
postoperative day 3. Laboratory studies on 3 of July included a
sodium of 141 , a potassium of 4.1 , a chloride of 104 , a bicarbonate
of 26 , a BUN of 15 , a creatinine of 0.8 , platelets of 114 , 000 , a
magnesium of 1.9 , a white count of 7 , 400 , an hematocrit of 40.3 ,
platelets of 206 , 000 , an INR of 0.8 , and a prothrombin time of
11.0.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient will go home on the following
medications: enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg
p.o. q.d. , Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for three days , Glyburide 5 mg p.o.
q.d. , ibuprofen 600 mg p.o. q.6h. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4h.
p.r.n. pain , atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. , and Atrovent inhaler two
puffs inhaled q.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will follow up with Vascular Surgery in
four weeks ( Dr. Ivanov ); with Cardiac Surgery ( Dr.
Muenzenberger ) in six weeks; and with Cardiology ( Dr. Zdon ) in one to two
weeks.
