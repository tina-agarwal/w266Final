pacemaker , presenting with exertional shortness of breath x 1
week , orthopnea , and runs of NSVT. Shortness of breath started 1
week ago. The patient was found to be in AFib and started on
Lopressor by PCP; however , shortness of breath worsened , patient
began sleeping upright in her recliner with worsening shortness
of breath. Denies any chest pain , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis ,
or radiating pain. Patient also reports decreased activities of

0.9 , MR , left atrial enlargement , TR , and PAP of 38. Patient
also has a history of chronic renal insufficiency; hypertension;
AFib , on Coumadin; status post permanent pacemaker; anemia;
status post bladder resection secondary to cancer;
insulin-dependent diabetes; aortic stenosis; hypothyroidism;
peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES: Patient has no known allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin 1 mg; insulin , Lantus , 30 units q.h.s.;
aspirin 325 mg; lisinopril 40 mg; Levoxyl 100 mcg; amiodarone 200
mg; Zocor 80 mg; Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.; Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,
Multivitamin; calcium carbonate.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in in-law apartment with
family. No tobacco or alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Notable for no fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , or chest pain. Patient does report a viral
syndrome 1 month ago. No new cough. Patient reports she last
felt well 1 month ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical exam in the ED notable for T-Max
97.1 , heart rate 68 , BP 95 to 122/61 to 83 , respiratory rate of
20. O2 sat 94 on room air. Patient was in no acute distress ,
sitting upright , and virtually speaking in full sentences.
Mucous membranes moist. JVP at the earlobes 18 to 20. Rhonchi
in her right base with an irregularly irregular rhythm , S1 and
S2 , 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal
border. Abdomen was obese , nontender , nondistended. Positive
bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities were warm ,
dry , and intact. No edema. DP , PT 1+ bilaterally. Skin was
warm , dry , and intact. No rashes. Patient was alert and oriented
x 3. Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact. Moving all
extremities.
LABORATORY DATA: Admission labs Notable for creatinine of 2.1
from baseline of 1.4 to 1.6. Potassium 4.7 , magnesium 2.7 , white
count 7.47 , hematocrit 46.3 from baseline 37 to 39. First set of
enzymes were negative. BNP 365 , INR of 3.3. Chest x-ray
consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG notable for atrial
fibrillation with nonspecific ST changes and a paced rhythm.
In summary , this is an 83-year-old female with a history of
coronary artery disease , hypertension , CHF , aortic valve
stenosis , paroxysmal AFib , status post permanent pacemaker with
recent conversion into AFib 1 week ago. Started on beta-blocker
by PCP , presenting with CHF exacerbation concerning for ischemia.
Telemetry also notable for multiple runs of NSVT concerning for
ongoing ischemia.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient has an EF of 35%. When last examined in
2003 , on presentation , was volume overloaded. However , BP was
well controlled. Patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and then
converted to an oral regimen. Blood pressure was titrated as
well as heart rate for improved rate control. ACE inhibitor was
initially held in the setting of worsening renal function ,
however , restarted prior to discharge. A repeat echo on 10/7
revealed an EF of 35% with an akinetic septal and inferior wall;
hypokinetic anterior lateral and posterior wall as well as left
atrial enlargement. Aortic valve stenosis with a gradient of 17
and mean of 10 with moderate AF , MR , TR with a peak AP of 29 and
the right atrial pressure similar to the prior study in 2003.
Ischemia , patient also has a history notable for coronary artery
disease status post CABG. Although the patient denied ongoing
chest pain , given history of diabetes , we were concerned for
ongoing ischemia. However , enzymes were negative x 3 with
telemetry notable for multiple runs of NSVT , stretching 20 to 30
beats , concerning for ongoing ischemia. Patient underwent
cardiac cath on 4/27 , which was notable for a left main 70%
stenosed and LAD 100% stenosed , circumflex 90% stenosed , RCA 100%
stenosed , large one 100% stenosed with an intact LIMA to LAD
graft as well as an intact SVT to OM graft. Patient underwent
Rotablator and balloon to the left circumflex and the OM lesions
and the LAD , left circumflex , and OM were stented. Patient was
continued on aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin. Patient was
started on Plavix. Patient was instructed to remain on Plavix
until further notice. Patient has baseline AFib with runs of
NSVT , which improved significantly status post revascularization.
Rate control was improved with a regimen of beta-blocker and
amiodarone. Patient will be continued to be monitored on
telemetry.
PULMONARY: Patient oxygenated well throughout her hospital stay.
Patient was carefully diuresed in the setting of acute on
chronic renal insufficiency in the setting of a dye load. On
discharge , she is oxygenating well on room air.
HEME: Hematocrit remained stable throughout her hospital course.
Coumadin was initially discontinued to proceed with cardiac
cath; however , patient was restarted on Coumadin with PCP
followup to follow INR. At the time of discharge , the patient has
mild thrombocytopenia. PCP will continue to monitor.
ENDOCRINE: Patient has a history of diabetes mellitus , on
insulin , was continued during her hospital stay , increased her
Lantus dose secondary to suboptimal blood sugar control.
Hemoglobin A1c in May was noted to be 6 , indicative of good
control. Patient also has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH
within normal limits and she was continued on her current dose of
Levoxyl.
RENAL: Patient has acute on chronic renal failure , baseline
creatinine of 1.4 to 1.6 , likely secondary to poor forward flow.
Creatinine improved with diuresis. At the time of discharge ,
creatinine was in the range of 1.8. Currently , she will be
continued to be followed as an outpatient. Patient will be
started back on ACE inhibitor prior to discharge. Prior to
cardiac cath , the patient did receive bicarb and Mucomyst to aid
in renal protection. At p.m. , patient was maintained on a
cardiac food-restricted diet.
NEURO , OPHTHO: Status post cardiac cath , patient complained of
left blurry vision. Patient was evaluated by neurology and
ophthalmology , which revealed a left corneal abrasion. They
recommended no further imaging studies , however , one may consider
carotid ultrasound as an outpatient to further evaluate.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d. , amiodarone 200 mg
q.d. , Lopressor 337.5 p.o. t.i.d. , Levoxyl 100 mcg p.o. q.d. ,

followed by Dr Downs Patient has home VNA for BP checks and
volume status. Any questions may be directed at Dr Dedecker
