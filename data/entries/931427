Discharge Date: 8/15/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: HEMOPTYSIS.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS:
1. SINUSITIS.
2. STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman
status post cardiac transplant ( 1/10 )
who was transferred to the Nasstrict Hospital Of with a
history of hemoptysis.
The patient underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for severe
ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a rather unremarkable
course except for the development of some graft CAD ( seen on last
catheterization ). The patient was admitted from 0/15/96 to
9/0/96 with a two month history of sputum production. The
patient was empirically started on IV cefotaxime and his
cyclosporine was adjusted up to 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient's
shortness of breath and respiratory problems subsequently resolved.
A CT of the chest showed prior granulomatous involvement of the
lung and spleen. The patient had AFB times three done: all
negative. The patient did have Mycobacterium avium grow out in his
sputum; however , this organism was not felt to be a pathogen for
him. After the patient was discharged , the patient continued
continued to have persistent ear fullness and pain , and a thick ,
but clear , nasal discharge. Then , approximately one week ago , the
patient noted increasing cough. The patient denies any associated
fevers or chills. On the day prior to admission , the patient noted
his sputum was blood tinged. The patient subsequently coughed up
approximately one quarter cup of bright red blood , which was
apparently witnessed in the Emergency Room at the outside hospital.
The patient apparently had some more hemoptysis ( amount not
documented ) on the night of admission; however , the patient has not
had any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ).
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Status post cardiac transplantation in
1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ).
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Status post coronary
artery bypass graft. 4. Status post a left ventral hernia repair.
5. Status post a right ankle fracture. 6. Status post goring by
bull in 1987. 7. Liver laceration. 8. Hypertension. 9. Peripheral
vascular disease.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Cyclosporine 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2.
Cardizem CD 180 mg p.o. q.day. 3. Imuran
175 mg p.o. q.h.s.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife in Jo The patient was a janitor until 9/14 The
patient smoked a half pack per day times 30 years. The patient
drinks only socially ( occasionally ).
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of a myocardial infarction at age 78.
Mother alive , but has diabetes mellitus ,
congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On vitals , temperature was 97.9 , blood
pressure 160/100 , heart rate 106 ,
respirations 20 , and O2 saturation 96% on two liters. The patient
is an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress.
HEENT examination was normocephalic , atraumatic. Pupils were
equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
muscles were intact. There was no lymphadenopathy. JVP was
approximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. Abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese ,
nontender , and nondistended. Extremities had 2+ bilateral lower
extremity edema. Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: SMA-7 was notable for glucose 284 , creatinine
1.2. CBC revealed a white count of 4 , hematocrit
35.2 , and platelets 191 , 000. PT was 13 , PTT 28.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient had no hemoptysis throughout his
Mo Hospital hospitalization.
The patient was scheduled for , and underwent , bronchoscopy on
7/2/96 , which revealed bronchiectasis of the anterior segment of
the left lower lobe ( where the CT abnormalities were seen ).
Purulent secretions were also encountered and sent for appropriate
cultures and tests. No evidence of malignancy was seen. The
Pulmonary team did recommend starting the patient on appropriate
antimicrobial coverage for MAI. Therefore , the patient was started
on clarithromycin and ethambutol. Given that these medications
effect the liver cytochrome P450 system , the patient's cyclosporine dose
required adjustment downward to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to keep his levels
200-300. The patient also underwent CT scan of his maxillofacial
area on 1/25/96. This scan revealed air levels in both maxillary
sinuses , as well as the sphenoid sinuses. Subtotal opacification
was seen in most of the ethmoid air cells. Also , subtotal
opacification of the mastoid air cells was demonstrated
bilaterally. The frontal sinuses appeared minimally developed; of
the few air cells present , there was complete opacification. The
overall impression was pain and sinus disease with left
otomastoiditis. The patient underwent further evaluation in the
ENT Clinic on 0/8/96 ; their recommendations included Biaxin times
four weeks ( the patient will be on this medication for at least
four weeks for coverage of MAI ). The Infectious Disease team
recommends that the patient's repeat AFBs be followed up and , if
they are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could be
stopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy. The
Pulmonary team also recommended that the patient be started on
Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers and have a set of pulmonary
function tests obtained as an outpatient. It is also recommended
that the patient be started on a cholesterol lowering agent at his
next Transplant Clinic visit ( LDL came back at 151 after patient's
discharge ).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Procardia XL 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,
cyclosporine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ethambutol
1 , 500 mg p.o. q.day , Atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffs
q.i.d. , Imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. , clarithromycin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Afrin two sprays n.a. b.i.d. times three days , and Ocean
Spray two sprays n.a. q.day.
CONDITION: Fair.
DISPOSITION: To home , follow up appointment in the Transplant
Clinic on 8/20/96 ; the patient also instructed to
arrange a follow up appointment with Dr. Gullace ( Pulmonary ). The
patient should have cyclosporine levels monitored carefully ,
especially over the next week or two.
