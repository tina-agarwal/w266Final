HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69 year old
Spanish speaking woman with a history
of significant coronary artery disease and other medical problems
as stated above who presented to us in the Emergency Department
complaining of chest pain. The patient was admitted recently on
March for bilateral iliac percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and received a popliteal to posterior tibial bypass
with saphenous vein on the right lower extremity. This was
complicated by a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with a troponin
level of 12.03 on January . The patient then became stable and
was discharged to rehab on November . On the day of admission ,
around 3 p.m. , the patient complained of 3/10 chest pain , headache
as well as upper extremity pain. The patient received Mylanta at
In Valley Hospital without any relief. She also received
Nitroglycerin sublingual x 2 with some relief. Electrocardiogram
was done at the rehab center at around 4 p.m. with no significant
changes compared to her previous electrocardiograms. Once
transport arrived to pick up patient to go to the Emergency
Department at Triingap Medical Center , patient became pain
free. She remained pain free for the entire transport as well as
in the Emergency Room. She denies any radiation of her pain. There
was no nausea or vomiting. However , given her significant past
medical history of coronary artery disease as well as a very recent
non-Q wave myocardial infarction , patient was admitted to the
General Medicine Service for rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Most of it is as stated above. The patient
had a cath in March , 1998 which showed 20% of
LAD stenosis , 70% of diagonal branch stenosis , 95% of the left
circumflex at the OM2 bifurcation and a stent was placed in the
left circumflex. Her echo in August of 1998 showed an ejection
fraction of 60% with mild AS and normal right ventricle function
and size and some left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient has a
coronary artery disease with a MIBI done in July of 1996 which was
notable for inferior ischemia with 5/25 segments. In addition to
her cardiac history and diabetes history , the patient also has a
history of panic attacks.
MEDICATIONS: On admission , the patient arrived with the following
medications: 1. Amlodipine 10 mg q.d. 2. Enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. 3. Atenolol 125 mg b.i.d. 4.
Captopril 100 mg t.i.d. 5. Percocet 1-2 tablets q. 4-6 hours prn
pain. 6. Axid 150 mg b.i.d. 7. Imdur 120 mg b.i.d. 8.
Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets , 1 tablet every 5 minutes x 3 prn
chest pain. 9. Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin gives the patient a rash. Patient also
reports an allergic reaction to a flu shot and TB shot.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies any history of smoking or
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general , patient is a Spanish speaking
elderly woman who does understand some
English and was resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress.
Vital signs , temperature 99.1 , heart rate 67 , blood pressure
170/90 , respiratory rate 16. Oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters
nasal cannula. Skin examination warm , dry. HEENT , pupils equal ,
round , reactive to light with extraocular muscles intact. Neck was
supple. She had JVD of about 8 centimeters. Lung examination was
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination reveals
regular rate and rhythm with no murmur , rub or gallop. Abdomen
examination reveals positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender in
palpation. On extremity examination , the patient has a long scar
on her right lower extremity with stitches in place as evidence of
her recent bypass surgery. The wound appears clean with no
exudates and no erythema. There is some mild edema on the right
lower extremity. There was no edema on the left lower extremity.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medicine
Service for rule out myocardial infarction. On
the day of admission , while on the floor , the patient had another
episode of chest pain or chest pressure. However , she reported
that this came on after she had eaten her meal and the pain was
localized to the epigastrium with no radiation. Her
electrocardiogram at that time showed no changes. She was given
some Maalox and this relieved her pain. During this
hospitalization , the patient did not have any cardiac related chest
pain. She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CK of 48
and then 21 and then 14. On admission , she had a troponin level of
0.17 , however , the patient did have a very recent myocardial
infarction on January with a troponin level of 12.03. It is very
possible that her troponin level of 0.17 is just the tail end of a
recent myocardial infarction and the level is on it's way down.
The patient remained chest pain free and afebrile during this
entire hospital stay. She was stable. Her medical management was
only changed with Hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d. added to her list of
medications. Per Cardiology , it is okay for patient to go back to
Honalt Hospital with the plan that she will need further
cardiac studies after she is released from her rehab center.
PROCEDURES: The patient did have a chest x-ray on admission
which showed only mild vascular engorgement and
otherwise normal chest x-ray. Her electrocardiogram on the 18 of April
showed ST depressions in the lateral leads as well as T wave
inversion in AVL. It was normal sinus rhythm. This is basically
with no significant changes compared to the electrocardiogram done
on February .
LABORATORY TESTS: Her CBC was normal. Her chem-7 revealed
sodium 134 , potassium 5.0 , chloride 97 , bicarb
26 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8. Her CK and troponin level was as
mentioned above.
DISPOSITION: Discharge medications: 1. Enteric coated aspirin
325 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3.
