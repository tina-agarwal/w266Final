HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 3/10/05 and underwent cardiac

LAD stenosis , 90% mid LAD and 100% distal LAD stenosis , 100% mid
LVB1 , 80% mid circumflex , 70% proximal D1 , 70% proximal PDA , and
a right dominant circulation. There is diffuse coronary
calcification and extensive diffuse disease with small distal
vessels. LAD in stent restenosis. There is collateral flow
diffusely small left main. The patient was taken to the
operating room on 4/15/05 and underwent CABG x4 with SVG1 to
RCA , and sequential graft of SVG2 to D1 and then OM1. The
patient also had LIMA to LAD and an LAD endarterectomy. The
patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit following surgery in
stable condition. He was given 150 mg of Plavix on arrival to
the ICU , and a second dose 6 hours later. He was also started on
heparin 500 units for 48 hours and given aspirin that same night.
The patient was extubated the following day and was noted to
require the transfusion of a unit of packed red blood cells. He
required neosynephrine transiently , which was weaned off on
postoperative day #2. That same day , he transferred to the
Step-Down Unit , neurologically intact , with pain well controlled ,
hemodynamically stable , started on aspirin , Lopressor , and
Plavix. The patient was also on 2 liters of oxygen at the time
of transfer , and had chest tube in that still had output. The

postoperatively. The patient was noted to have a preoperative
urinary tract infection of E. coli for which he was started on
levofloxacin on 0/5/05 and treated for five days. On
postoperative day #3 , his wires , chest tubes and Foley were
removed. He was noted to have loose lower front teeth following
his difficult intubation , and the Dental Service was called to
see the patient. The recommendation was simply to avoid putting
pressure on those teeth and they advised that this would allow
the teeth to retighten in the jaw over the next couple of weeks.
The patient continued to do well , remained in sinus rhythm , and
was weaned off oxygen , saturating well on room air. He
progressed daily and walked first with assistance and then
steadily on his own. He is discharged to home in good condition
