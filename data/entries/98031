ATTENDING: SIMMON , JEFFERY MD
ADDENDUM:
Addendum to discharge summary , record number #9880981 which was
dictated by Kovats , Doyle Bradly .
ADDENDUM TO DISCHARGE SUMMARY:
NEURO: Neurology consult was obtained for increased somnolence
over the past three weeks , which was noted per the patient's son
which he thinks is a change from baseline. Neurology consult
recommended that we get an MRI/MRA of the brain with gadolinium
contrast to look for leptomeningeal disease and other sources for
increased somnolence which are treatable. They also recommended
an EEG be done. The EEG was done and showed no seizure activity.
The MRI/MRA was done and showed only a right MCA infarct , which
was known and old with no interval change. Gadolinium contrast
was not given because the patient became too agitated and was
moving too much during the study for an effective study to be
obtained. They also recommended that we check certain labs
including folate , B12 , TSH and RPR all of which were essentially
normal. TSH was elevated but patient has a history of
hypothyroidism and is on Synthroid. Neurology was consulted on
the day of discharge and they agreed that no further evaluation
of the somnolence is necessary at this time. If the somnolence
continues into the near future further evaluation may be
necessary. Leptomeningeal disease is unlikely given the lack of
new neurological findings , and since the patient is scheduled for
a PET scan of the chest to evaluate for spread of her known lung
cancer , if there is no interval change in her oncological process
the likeliness of leptomeningeal disease is quite low.

DISCHARGE EXAM: On the day of discharge , the patient was
afebrile with a temperature of 96.7. She remained slightly
hypertensive with a blood pressure range of 103 to 152 systolic
and 54 to 90 diastolic. Her heart rate , respirations and oxygen
saturations were all normal. She was urinating on her own
without a Foley catheter. Her blood sugars were stable. A
one-to-one sitter which had been placed prior during her hospital
course was discontinued. Her ciprofloxacin course for her
urinary tract infection was discontinued because she had been
