DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. CHF.
2. Stage IV esophageal cancer.
PRESENTING SYMPTOMS:
Mr. Kanaan is a 68-year-old gentleman with stage IV esophageal
cancer who was two weeks status post his third cycle of
chemotherapy for his cancer. He also had ischemic cardiomyopathy
with a known ejection of 20% and coronary artery disease status
post CABG in 1993. He presented with progressive shortness of
breath over the three days prior to admission. He denied any
fever. However , he did note increase in his weight and increased
lower extremity edema over the last week. He has three-pillow
orthopnea at baseline , but has been sleeping both upright for the
three days prior to admission. Two weeks prior to admission , he
was walking in the mall and was able to accomplish all of his
ADLs without difficulty. On admission , he was unable to walk
more than 20 feet without becoming severely dyspneic. He does
describe having diminished appetite , increased fatigue , and three
days of copious watery stool , possibly related to his
chemotherapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for pneumonia two weeks ago treated as an outpatient ,
esophageal cancer stage IV status post chemo x3 cycles ,
obstructive sleep apnea , ischemic cardiomyopathy , COPD , atrial
fibrillation status post pacemaker and AICD placement , gout ,
pulmonary vasculitis , and also CAD.
OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
Include amiodarone , digoxin , colchicine , Atrovent , lisinopril ,
spironolactone , torsemide , Ativan , Zocor , and Prilosec.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He lives at home and denies alcohol use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
The patient was afebrile with the temperature of 95.8. His heart
rate was in the 90s. His blood pressure was 90/60 breathing at a
rate of 22. His room air oxygenation was 82% , but increased to
98% on 3 liters nasal cannula. He was slightly uncomfortable
sitting straight up in bed and visibly tachypnic. His lung exam
demonstrated bilateral scattered wheezes throughout the lung
fields and bibasilar crackles. His JVP was approximately 15 cm.
Heart exam reveled regular rate and rhythm with prominent S3.
Abdominal exam was nontender. His extremities had 2+ pitting
edema to the knees.
PERTINENT LABS:
On admission , he had a creatinine of 1.7 , which is at his
baseline and BUN of 46. His BNP was 2960 , CK 48 , CK-MB 1.0 , and
troponin 0.1. Hematocrit 44.5 , white count 7.8 , and D-dimer was
150. His INR was 1.3.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
The patient had a palliative esophageal stent placed on 2/8/05 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient presented with exam and labs
findings consistent with decompensated heart failure. For this ,
he had a known ejection fraction of 20%. While he was in the
hospital , he had strict I's and O's and was diuresed with Lasix
and torsemide. His diureses was somewhat limited by systolic
blood pressure with a range of 85 to 110 during his
hospitalization. On discharge , his weight was down to 82.1 kg
and was down from 87.5 on admission. The patient did have slight
leak in his troponin of 0.1 on admission , but his EKG was
unchanged and his enzymes x3 were negative except for the
troponin , which did not trend to higher. His cardiac medical
regimen was maximized with an ACE inhibitor or statin and baby
aspirin was started on him. He was discharged home on torsemide
100 mg daily in addition to his spironolactone dose.
2. Pulmonary: The patient received Atrovent nebulizers in-house
to help with his shortness of breath. His primary etiology ,
however , was pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart
failure. His diuresis goal of 1.5 liter a day was achieved with
the combination of dopamine , nesiritide , and Lasix drips. He was
most responsive to combination of nesiritide and dopamine. At
the time of discharge , the patient's room air saturations were
94% with ambulatory saturations of 86%. He was therefore
discharged home with oxygen to use overnight and when
symptomatic.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient was admitted with diarrhea
that was felt to be related to his chemotherapy , which has been
completed two weeks earlier. Stool was sent out for C.
difficile , which was negative. His colchicine was initially held
because of his diarrhea , but the patient then developed a flare
of his gout in his right great toe. Colchicine was resumed to
treat this with good results. The patient received palliative
stent to his esophagus on 2/8/05 that is placed by Dr. Cap
without complications. The patient had plans to follow up with
is outpatient oncologist for ongoing care of his esophageal
cancer after discharge.
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine was 1.7. His baseline
chronic renal insufficiency was with the creatinine of
approximately 1.3 to 1.5. At discharge , his creatinine was 1.6 ,
which has been stable throughout his entire stay. He briefly
required having a Foley catheter placed on 8/28/05 because of
urinary retention , but it was removed the next day without
difficulty and did not have problems with voiding prior to
discharge.
5. Hematology: The patient was placed on DVT prophylaxis with
Lovenox. He did exhibit some right leg edema more pronounced
than his left leg edema , but this is felt to be due to his gout
in his right great toe.
The patient was discharged to home with services and PT was
arranged to go and do a home safety evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:
The patient's vital signs were stable. He was resting
comfortably in bed. Crackles in his lungs were notably
diminished from admission. He no longer was tachypnic. His
heart had a regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , occasional S3. No
murmurs. Abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities had
trace pitting edema.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 300 mg daily.
2. Colchicine 0.6 mg every other day.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
4. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.
5. Lisinopril 5 mg daily.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg b.i.d.
7. Spironolactone 12.5 mg daily.
8. Trazodone 50 mg at night.
9. Multivitamins one tablet daily.
10. Torsemide 100 mg daily.
