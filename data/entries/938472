Discharge Date: 0/11/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Jesus Wigham , whose past medical
history includes diabetes ,
hypertension , and multiple prior coronary interventions
( ballooned ) , presents in a stable state for elective coronary
artery bypass graft , after a cardiac catheterization showed two
vessel disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 15 of April the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting , left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to left coronary
artery and then to obtuse marginal. After surgery the patient
became hypotensive and ischemic. A new angiogram was performed
which showed three vessel coronary artery disease , an occluded
sequential venous graft to obtuse marginal and left coronary
artery , and a patent left internal mammary artery graft.
The patient was reoperated; a new coronary artery bypass graft was
performed on 7 of July , a new vein graft was placed to the right
posterior descending artery and another one to the obtuse marginal.
An intra-aortic balloon pump had been previously placed and was
removed three days later.
OTHER EVENTS DURING HOSPITAL STAY: 1. Volume over-load for
which the patient has still
some fluid retention and is still being on diuretics.
2. The patient underwent multiple interventions in her groins ,
mostly for placement of arterial lines and intra-aortic balloon
pump. Some hematoma developed but it never worsened. Vascular
Surgery was consulted but no further intervention was done.
3. A very dubious diagnosis of cellulitis was done just after her
surgery for a redness and swelling in her leg and feet. Infectious
Disease was consulted and they ruled out the idea of cellulitis as
the patient has lichen ruber planus and Infectious Disease said
that this was the reason for her redness. In the last two days of
her stay in our hospital , the redness became a little bit more
visible , and there was some question of increased white blood
cells , so it was decided to start her on Ancef and it should be
continued for about seven more days.
4. The patient is on three days of levofloxacen treatment for a
urinary tract infection.
5. When the diagnosis of cellulitis was hypothized the first time ,
a Doppler study of her lower extremity was done that showed no
obstruction to venous flow.
6. The patient also went for a period in atrial fibrillation and
was treated and converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta
blockers , namely Lopressor.
CURRENT CONDITION: At present the patient is in stable condition ,
afebrile , heart rate 81 in sinus , blood
pressure 120/60 , respiratory rate 20 , with a saturation of 96% in
room air. Her blood sugar is 189 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium
137 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 151 , white blood cells 10.7 ,
hematocrit 28.4 , and INR 1.4.
The list of medications is included in the discharge summary.
Thank you for accepting this patient.
