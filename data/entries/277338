post bilateral total hip replacements , chronic shoulder bony damage

HOSPITAL COURSE: Mrs. Pettit is a 35-year-old woman with a long
history of transfusion dependent aplastic anemia
with multiple complications secondary to hemochromatosis and
chronic steroid use. She was admitted for replacement of a Hickman
catheter which had fallen out in May of this year. Prior to the
procedure she was transfused with two bags of platelets. She had
one bag of platelets on call to the Interventional Radiology Suite ,
but did not require these platelets. She was also transfused two
units of packed red cells for a hematocrit of 23. On August ,
1999 , she had a right internal jugular venous Hickman catheter
placed without difficulty. There were no complications from the
procedure. There is no pneumothorax by fluoroscopy. The tip was
in the proximal right atrium , okay to use. Both lumens aspirated
freely and were flushed with heparin prior to being sent back up on
the floor. On the evening of August , 1999 , Ms. Deboer began an
infusion of Desferal while in house , watching carefully for signs
of anaphylaxis , as she has not received an infusion in over two
months. After she completes her Desferal infusion , she will be
sent home with visiting nurse for Hickman catheter care and
followup with Dr. Keith Hermans in clinic.
