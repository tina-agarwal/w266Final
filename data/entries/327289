The patient received care on the Stockvi
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Dilated cardiomyopathy with associated
problems of hypertension and asthma.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 53 year old female with hypertension x
eight years , who presents with increased dyspnea
on exertion and admitted for left and right heart catheterization ,
and to optimize blood pressure control.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 53 year old Afro-American
female , first diagnosed with
hypertension in 1987. She presented to the Emergency Room in 1987
with acute atypical chest pain , and was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. ETT in 1987 demonstrated chest pain during exercise
and suggestive ST T wave changes in the inferolateral leads during
exercise. The patient was discharged from the hospital , and did
relatively well with intermittent chest pain on exertion.
Exercise tolerance test in 1991 demonstrated consistent , but not
diagnostic of ischemia. No chest pain. Echocardiogram in 1992
demonstrated inferior , posterior , and apical hyperkinesis , low to
normal global pattern of systolic contractile function , and a
celionous redundancy of the mitral anterior leaflet , with only
trace mitral regurgitation.
Since 1992 , the patient has developed severe shortness of breath
with positive chest discomfort of pin and needles in the left
chest , which radiates down her left arm. She notes positive
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with the need of sleeping elevated at
45 degrees at some times.
Echocardiogram in 1994 demonstrated moderately dilated left
ventricle with severely depressed systolic function. Ejection
fraction equals 26%. There was 2+ mitral regurgitation and mild
left atrial enlargement also noted. Mild tricuspid regurgitation
with pulmonary artery pressure estimated at approximately 25.
Due to her hypertension and decreased left ventricular function ,
the patient presents to the Ton Medical Center for a left
and right side catheterization , and also for monitoring of her
blood pressure. Her blood pressure ranged , as an outpatient ,
between 170 to 180/100 to 110.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. As above.
2. Asthma.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Beclovent 4 puffs b.i.d.
2. Enalapril 4 mg q.d.
3. Diltiazem 360 mg q.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
HABITS: The patient smokes one-half per day to one pack per day
for the last twenty-five years. Alcohol , occasional.
FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's mother died in her sleep at age 50
of unknown reasons. Her father died due to a
motor vehicle accident. Two brothers and one sister all died at
age 30 to 40 , the patient does not know cause.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has not worked since 1995 due to what
she states as shortness of breath and chest pain.
She has three daughters , all in good health , and four
grandchildren.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , this is a 53 year
old female , Afro-American , in no apparent
distress. Vital signs: Temperature 97.6 , blood pressure 134/72
after Hydralazine , heart rate 75 , respiratory rate of 12. HEENT
examination: Extraocular movements are intact. Pupils are equal ,
round , reactive to light. Nasal oral pharynx had no discharge , and
was clear with no exudates. Neck: No adenopathy , no jugular
venous distention , no thyromegaly. Carotids are 2+ with no bruits.
Lungs revealed diffuse expiratory wheezes , prolonged expiratory
phase , no rhonchi or rales. Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate
and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , positive S4 , with a 2/6 systolic
murmur at the apex. The abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender ,
non-distended , with no obvious hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities
revealed no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , and no bruits. Pulses
were 2+ throughout. Neurological examination: Alert and oriented
x three , nonfocal examination.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Labs upon admission revealed an SMA-7 of
143 , 4.1 , 102 , 28 , 20 , 1.2 , and 93. CBC
of 6.3 , 46.1 , and 280. PT and PTT of 12.5 and 28.4. ALT of 14 ,
AST of 19 , LDH of 197 , alkaline phosphatase of 77 , total bilirubin
of .3 , total protein of 7.9 , albumin of 4.2. Globulins of 3.7 ,
calcium of 9.4 , phosphate of 4.4 , cholesterol of 210 , and
triglyceride of 67.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
hospital day number one which demonstrated no
coronary artery disease disease , right atrium pressure of 12 , PA
pressure of 56/32 with a mean of 38 and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 20. Cardiac output was 5.1 , SVR of 1459 , and PVR of
282. The patient was then admitted to the Floor for workup of her
hypertension. Urine metanephrine and urine VMA were sent. The
patient's Enalapril was discontinued in order to perform the
Captopril Renogram Test. The patient was started on Diltiazem 180
mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg b.i.d. , and Hydralazine 10 mg t.i.d.
The patient's blood pressure , on hospital day number three , was
130/70 and well-controlled. Her heart rate was 70 to 80. On
hospital day number four , the patient underwent a Captopril
Renogram Test which was negative for renal artery stenosis. Other
hypertension workup Epinephrine , Dopamine , Metanephrine , VMA and
ANA are still pending.
The patient was discharged home on hospital day number five , with
blood pressure being well-controlled throughout her hospital visit
in the 130/70's.
The patient's hypertension control was attributed to the fact that
number one , she stopped smoking during her hospital stay; two , she
was inactive and was on bed rest; and three , the possibility of
strict compliance with medications while in the hospital.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Diltiazem 180 mg po q.d.
2. Enalapril 10 mg po q.d.
3. Lasix 80 mg po b.i.d.
4. One aspirin per day.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged home in stable
and good condition.
FOLLOW-UP: The patient will have follow-up with PACKMA TEDET UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL CENTER on Thursday ,
May , 1995 for check of blood pressure and
frequent blood follow-up with Dr. Pillon on Monday , July ,
1995.
