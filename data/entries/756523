ATTENDING: LUCIEN KURT DYRON MD
This discharge summary summarizes his Intensive Care Unit course
from January , 2005 to August , 2005.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , Mr. Adas is a 69-year-old
African-American male who is postoperative day 11 from a
reoperative aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair for
endocarditis. His postoperative course was complicated by
Mobitz's type II heart block and long sinuses pauses for which he
was transferred to the ICU on account of snow storm making
staffing issues difficult to take care of him on the floor. He
remained in the Intensive Care Unit one day.
HOSPITAL COURSE: His Intensive Care Unit course by system is:
1. Neurologic: The patient was complaining of pain at his
Quintin catheter insertion site for which he was treated with
oxycodone.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was initially transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit with bradycardia and Mobitz's type II heart
block and 6-7 second sinus pauses. He was asymptomatic for all
of these events with good hemodynamics. However , given the large
snow storm and short staffing , it was felt that he would be
better off in the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring. He
had no major issues in the Intensive Care Unit. He was switched
from labetalol and amlodipine as well as his beta blocker eye
drops so as to not exacerbate his heart block. He did have some
difficult to control hypertension which was treated with
hydralazine which was titrated up to 80 q.i.d. with good result.
In addition , he was maintained on Losartan and Lisinopril. He
was followed by the Electrophysiology Service who came to the
conclusion that the patient does need a permanent pacemaker;
however , the issue of when and how to place the pacemaker has yet
to be resolved as the patient has difficult venous access issues
given his multiple clotted AV fistulas and poor venous access
sites. The Electrophysiology Service and Dr. Wickert are in the
process of deciding what the best approach for his pacemaker is.
Hew as in a sinus rhythm with occasional asymptomatic bradycardia
in the 40s but otherwise stable rhythm.
3. Respiratory: No issues.
4. GI: He is on a renal diet which he tolerated. He is also on
a bowel regimen and on 2 liter fluid restriction per the Renal
Team.
5. Renal: The patient is followed by renal medicine. He is
anuric and he is dialyzed Saturday , Tuesday , Thursday. He had no
acute renal issues although his potassium was somewhat on the
high side between 4.8 and 5.0 but trended down by the next day.
He was followed by the Vascular Surgery Service who have
determined that his right AV fistula is not salvageable. They
plan to do a left AV fistula on an outpatient basis once the
patient's current cardiac issues have resolved and he is
discharged from the hospital.
6. Endocrine: No issues.
7. Heme: No issues. The patient is on an aspirin 81 mg a day.
8. ID: The patient came in to the Intensive Care Unit on
Vancomycin , Gentamicin and Rifampin for presumed endocarditis
although all of his cultures have been negative. He has
continued on these in the hospital. He is afebrile without a
white count.
