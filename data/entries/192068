basline , pt reports exertional angina and dyspnea walking ~1 block , 1-2
pillow orthopnea. Over the past week , pt
reports increased anginal frequency , occasionally
at rest , and development of dyspnea at rest.
+PND and dietary indiscretion , no palps , LH. In
ED received NTG , Lasix , Lisinopril which
produced some mod improvement. Cardiac hx notable for
TTE 1998 w/ EF 50% ( incr from 35% in '97 ) , inf
HK. ETT-MIBI '97 for 9 min ( modified Bruce ) w/
inf defect and mild ischemia. CXR showed mod

use 2-3 days ago , +recent EtOH use.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
CV:
1. ISCHEMIA: History concerning for ischemia , given subacute
increase in sxs of angina and dyspnea in pt w/ CAD , DM , PVD. Persistent
CP at rest , started Heparin , NTG gtt. Changed BB to CCB for +cocaine
tox , but d/c'd CCB 2/2 HOTN. MIBI 5/26 showed small fixed inferior
defect in PDA territory ( c/w old IMI ) , no ischemia , EF 28% , global LV
dysfxn , worst inferiorly. Cards recommended cath 5/14 to r/o ischemia
as cause of newly decreased EF ( see below ) -&gt; nonobstructive CAD
( diag30% ) , NL L heart filling pressures. Continued ASA/Capto/statin;
d/c'd asa/statin when no CAD demonstrated. 2. PUMP: Clearly volume
overloaded on admission , but showed marked
improvement following diuresis w/ Lasix. TTE 10/16 EF 25% , global HK ,
most severe inf/post/IS walls from base to apex , tr AI , mild MR/TR ,
secundum-type ASD w/ L-&gt;R shunt , possible veg vs thrombus on one of
pacing wires. Eval'd by EP service for pacer thrombus vs. veggie ,
recommended heparin while in house -&gt; changed to Lovenox to Coumadin
bridge at time of discharge , especially in light of stroke risk w/ newl
y-discovered ASD. Etiology of CMP not certain , but pt has significant
EtOH as well as cocaine history. Iron studies normal , TSH low , free T4
normal. Will aim for lower therapeutic INR given prob w/ compliance.
3.RHYTHM: S/p PPM , h/o paroxysmal Afib/flutter , needs consideration of
longterm anticoagulation for atrial arrythmia but will be determined
as outpatient , since currently pt needs to be anticoagulated regardl
ess for pacer lead thrombus.
GI: Followed serial LFTs , resolved to
normal w/ diuresis.
ID: Initially started empiric Naf/gent 10/7 for ?veggie on pacer wire ,
but no clinical e/o endocarditis and blood cx's ( pre-abx ) all
NGTD. D/c'd abx 5/26 , followed surveillance cx's ( all NGTD at time of
discharge ).
SUBSTANCE ABUSE: Admits to inhaled cocaine in
last week , denies IVDU or recent EtOH. Eval'd by
YH team , and refused referral for EtOH/drug
abuse counseling.
