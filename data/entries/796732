walked inside and called 911. The patient was admitted to the
emergency room , and at that time , he complained of no chest pain ,
no palpitations , but underwent a cardiac workup , which revealed
three-vessel coronary artery disease with LAD , circumflex , and
right distribution , and was consulted for surgical
revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

hypercholesterolemia , history of prostate cancer , treated with
XRT , and spinal stenosis.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Status post TURP.
FAMILY HISTORY:
No family history of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No history of tobacco use.
ALLERGIES:
Penicillin , no reaction is noted on this H&amp;P.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. once a day , baby aspirin at 81 mg p.o. once

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Height 5 feet 6 inches , weight 63 kg. Vital signs: Temperature
of 98.2 , heart rate of 61 , blood pressure in the right arm of
152/58 , blood pressure on the left arm of 160/60 , and O2
saturation of 100%. HEENT: PERRLA , dentition without evidence
of infection , no carotid bruits. Chest: No incision.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs noted.
Pulses , 2+ pulses throughout except for dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial bilaterally which was present by Doppler only.
Allen's test of both left and right upper extremity by pulse
oxymetry is listed here as normal. Breath sounds are clear
bilaterally. Abdomen: No incisions , soft , no mass noted.
Rectal was deferred. Extremities: Without scarring , varicosity
or edema. Neuro: Alert and oriented , with no focal deficits.
The patient has a torn right biceps muscle which formed a mass
that was palpable distal to the humerus.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY VALUES:
Chemistries on 8/14/06 , sodium 138 , K of 4.4 , chloride of 102 ,
CO2 of 29 , BUN of 34 , creatinine of 1.2 , glucose of 193 , and a
magnesium of 2.1. Hematology from the same day , white count of
10.5 , hematocrit of 39.7 , hemoglobin of 13.9 , and platelets of
147 , 000. PT of 14.9 , INR of 1.2 , and a PTT of 23.5. Cardiac
catheterization on 8/14/06 performed at the Ne Lourdesven Medical Center showed
coronary anatomy of 75% proximal and 50% mid LAD , a 75% ostial
and 90% proximal circumflex , and 95% proximal OM1 , and 100%
proximal RCA with a right dominant circulation. Echo on 7/13/06
showed an ejection fraction of 55% , the aortic valve was
trileaflet , mildly thickened and sclerotic , with mild-to-moderate
aortic regurgitation , without ventricular dilatation , mitral
valve is normal in structure with mild-to-moderate mitral
regurgitation , tricuspid valve is structurally normal with
minimal tricuspid regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 10/30/06 to the Cardiology Service
for cardiac workup including an echo and cardiac catheterization
and referred for surgical vascularization and was taken to the
operating room on 4/18/06 and underwent a coronary artery bypass
grafting x3 with a LIMA to the LAD , a saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The
patient came off the heart-lung machine without any difficulty ,
on just TNG and insulin and extubated 7 hours postoperatively.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYMPTOMS:
1. Neurologically , remained intact.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm
throughout his postoperative course. The patient with his prior
history presenting with syncopal episode was evaluated by the
Electrophysiology Service , and with his past history of
nonsustained VT , the patient underwent EP studies to evaluate if
needed a permanent pacer or ICD. The patient was taken down to
their suite and found to have normal HV as well as sinus node.
There was no inducible atrial or ventricular arrhythmias , and no
VA conduction on baseline , and felt that he had normal studies
and did not require any pacer or ICD , and will be just discharged
on some beta-blocker.
3. Respiratory: The patient was weaned to room air by
postoperative day #2 , and discharge chest x-ray showed no
evidence of edema or effusion.
4. GI: The patient was placed on some Nexium for surgical
prophylaxis , but with no prior history , was not discharged on any
medication.
5. Renal: The patient was on just very low-dose Lasix in the
immediate postoperative period , but the patient was autodiuresing
on his own quite well , and by postoperative day #2 , Lasix was
discontinued , and throughout his postoperative course , the
patient had a stable BUN and creatinine.
6. Endocrine: The patient was just on oral agents for his
diabetes and required some insulin drip perioperatively , but by
day of discharge , the patient was back on his preoperative
glipizide and will not be discharged on any insulin.
7. Heme: The patient had a stable hematocrit , did not require
any transfusion , and discharged with a hematocrit of 32.
8. ID: The patient was on vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis
but had no further infectious issues and will be discharged on no
further antibiotics. By postoperative day #5 , the patient was
doing quite well , and a decision was made for the patient to be
discharged to home in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , full aspirin 325 mg p.o. once a

mg q.p.m. and 50 mg p.o. q.a.m. , Motrin 400 mg p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n.
