ATTENDING: SATTERLUND , MOHAMMED MD
SERVICE:
Cardiac Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Sabean is a 75-year-old gentleman with history of
insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia who had a history
of myocardial infarction and stent placement of his right
coronary artery in 1/29 .  The patient had two recent episodes
of dyspnea on exertion with mild activity which resolved
spontaneously. Cardiac catheterization was performed , which
revealed a left circumflex coronary artery with a proximal 35%
stenosis , first obtuse marginal coronary artery with a proximal
80% stenosis , right coronary artery with a proximal 60% stenosis
and a mid 80% stenosis and a distal 80% stenosis , posterior left
ventricular branch , ostial 80% stenosis and a left anterior
descending coronary artery with a proximal 45% stenosis , and
right dominant circulation. Echocardiogram revealed ejection
fraction of 60% , trivial mitral insufficiency , trivial tricuspid
insufficiency , trivial pulmonic insufficiency , and no regional
wall motion abnormalities.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for myocardial infarction in 1980s , PTCA atherectomy
in 1997 , and a recent stent placement of his right coronary
artery in 11/11/06 .  History of hypertension , cerebrovascular
accident with no residual presented with left-sided weakness ,
chronic renal insufficiency , diabetes mellitus , chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease , and psoriasis.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
nadolol 80 mg daily , and lisinopril 40 mg b.i.d. , isosorbide 30
mg daily , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg
daily , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily , atorvastatin 80 mg daily ,
metformin 500 mg b.i.d. , Lantus 42 units in the evening and
NovoLog 6 units with lunch and 12 units at dinner , triamcinolone
topical ointment , and allopurinol 300 mg daily
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiac exam: Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or
heaves. Peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally in the
carotid , radial , femoral pulses , and 1+ bilaterally in the
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses. Respirator:
Breath sounds clear bilaterally , is otherwise , noncontributory.
ADMISSION LABS:
Sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride of 104 , CO2 26 , BUN of 28 ,
creatinine 1.2 , glucose 89 , and magnesium 2.2. WBC 8.73 ,
hematocrit 39.2 , hemoglobin 13.2 , and platelets of 248 , 000. PT
13.3 , PT/INR 1.0 , and PTT of 28.1. Carotid noninvasives revealed
left internal carotid artery with less than 50% occlusion and
right internal carotid artery with a 60% occlusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Sawka was brought to the operating room on 6/14/06 where he
underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with left
internal mammary artery to the first diagonal coronary artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal coronary
artery with a sequential graft and then saphenous vein graft
connecting from the right coronary artery to the first left
ventricular branch. Total bypass time was 127 minutes and total
circulatory arrest time was 11 minutes. Intraoperatively , the
patient's aorta was not clamped due to calcifications ,
appropriate locations for cannulation and proximals were
identified with epicardial echocardiogram. The patient was
cooled to 20 degrees. Distal anastomoses were done under
ventricular fibrillatory arrest with brief circulatory arrest.
Proximals were done under circulatory arrest. The patient did
well intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident. He was
brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and
stable condition. Postoperatively , the patient was initially
ventricularly paced , and started on dopamine which was discontinued
on 6/15/06 .  The
patient also had rate controlled atrial fibrillation that was
treated with Lopressor and
started on Coumadin for anticoagulation , he did convert to normal
sinus rhythm. He was extubated on 4/18/06 and he did have some
postoperative low urine output , which improved with his dopamine
and intravenous Lasix. Diabetes Service also followed the
patient throughout his postoperative course for his glucose
control. He was transferred to the
Step-Down Unit on postoperative day #5. Mr. Corneluis also received
2 units of packed red blood cells postoperatively for
postoperative anemia. Mr. Ouellet was screened by physical
therapy for rehab and was cleared for discharge to rehabilitation
on 9/10/06 .  That morning , the patient complained of intense pain
in his feet , which was found to be from a gouty flare ,
rheumatology was consulted and they recommended a short course of
prednisone along with colchicine for approximately three weeks
and then to be restarted on allopurinol 100 mg after his
colchicine course is completed. The patient's pain and swelling did improve
overnight. He was reevaluated the following morning and
cleared for discharge to rehabilitation on June
on postoperative day #9.
DISCHARGE LABS:
Sodium 141 , potassium 4.3 , chloride of 105 , CO2 29 , BUN 35 ,
creatinine 1.4 , glucose 95 , and magnesium 1.9 , WBC 14.6 ,
hematocrit 33.5 , hemoglobin 11.4 , and platelets of 484 , 000. PT
17.3 , PT/INR 1.4 , and PTT of 36.4.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Are as follows; allopurinol 100 mg once a day after his
colchicine course is completed , Lipitor 80 mg daily , Plavix 75 mg
daily , colchicine 0.6 mg t.i.d. for three days and then 0.6 mg
b.i.d. for three days , and then down to 0.6 mg daily for three
weeks , Lasix 20 mg daily , NovoLog sliding scale q.a.c. and at
bedtime , NovoLog 12 units with breakfast and lunch and 10 units
with supper , Lantus 44 units at bedtime , potassium chloride slow
release 10 mEq daily , Toprol-XL 200 mg daily , oxycodone 5 mg q.
4h. p.r.n. pain , and prednisone taper , the patient received 24 mg
daily , then 20 , then 16 , 12 , 8 mg , 4 mg and down to 0 mg.
