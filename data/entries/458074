ATTENDING: MILO SASENGBONG M.D.
SERVICE: Memp Moreford Ter
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Non-ST elevation MI.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure , COPD ,
hypertension , diabetes mellitus , gout , hypercholesterolemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 72-year-old female
with a history of hypertension , renal artery stenosis , diabetes ,
chronic renal insufficiency , and COPD who presents with 3 days of
increasing shortness of breath. The patient reports that over
the 3 days prior to admission. She had increased shortness of
breath and worsening dyspnea on exertion. At baseline , she can
usually walk a block before becoming short of breath and over
these past few days , she can no longer walk several feet. She
also reports that she has a productive cough with whitish sputum
and recently recovered from an upper respiratory tract infection
3 weeks ago. She denies any chest pain , palpitations , or
lightheadedness , nausea , vomiting , and diaphoresis. She has had
stable 3-pillow orthopnea for many years with no recent increase
in lower extremity edema. She does note a 5-pound weight gain
over the past week prior to admission. The patient had been
followed recently as an outpatient by both cardiology and renal
for her hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. She has
known renal artery stenosis by MRI in February 2004 and recently
had an episode of acute renal insufficiency with an increase in
her creatinine from 1.6 to 2.7 in the setting of Lasix and
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The patient has been taking
extra Lasix. So in the week prior to admission , she had run out
of this medication. In the emergency room , the patient was
hypertensive and in mild respiratory distress ( 92% on room air ).
She was given nebulizers and Lasix 80 mg IV with a diuresis of
1.5 liters. In the emergency room , she describes some left-sided
chest pain , worse with inspiration , which lasted a few minutes
with some associated nausea and vomiting. An EKG showed ST
depressions in leads V2 through V6.

diabetes mellitus , COPD , anemia , osteoarthritis , gout , peripheral
vascular disease , and hypercholesterolemia.

with normal active bowel sounds. Extremities: Trace pedal
edema. Neurovascular: The patient was alert and oriented x3
with a nonfocal neurologic exam.
LABS ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for a BUN of 40 and a creatinine
of 1.6 ( this is decreased from 2.7 in March 2005 ). BNP was 95.
CK 95 , troponin negative. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with
PACs. Normal axis , ST depressions in V2 through V6. Chest x-ray
showed a left lower lobe infiltrate/opacity. No effusions , no
edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient with shortness of
breath on admission and ST depression in V2 through V6. The
patient had an episode of chest pain at rest on the floor with a
positive troponin to 10.8 on 5/22/2005. No progression of the
EKG changes seen in the emergency room. The patient was started
on IV heparin and cardiology was called to arrange for cardiac
catheterization. However , the patient was noted to have a
decrease in her hematocrit from 30 to 23. She was guaiac
negative. Cath was initially put on hold for the patient to be
transfused. The patient then became chest pain free starting
7/9/2005. Her enzymes trended down. IV heparin was
discontinued on 6/24/2005. The patient had a MIBI on
11/24/2005 , which showed areas of ischemia in the distal LAD and
OM territories. The patient underwent catheterization on
9/18/2005 , which showed chronically occluded RCA with collateral
50% LAD lesion , 95% tubular proximal D1 lesion , 50% tubular OM1
lesion; no stents were placed. She was continued on aspirin ,
beta-blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor. The patient had one
additional episode of chest pain on 8/19/2005. In this instance
chest pain was pleuritic with no associated ischemic symptoms and
EKG remained unchanged. This was thought unlikely to be of
ischemic origin. The patient has no chest pain or shortness of
breath since this time up until the time of discharge. Pump:
The patient was felt to be volume overloaded on admission
( secondary to Lasix noncompliance. The patient was initially
given 80 mg of IV Lasix with a diuresis of 1.5 liters. Diuresis
was then more gentle with an I/O goal of even to negative 500 cc
per day. Lasix was held prior to cath. The patient was thought
to be dry status post her large diuresis. The patient will
resume her Lasix at a lower dose of 40 mg q.d. on discharge. A
transthoracic echo on 1/30/2005 showed an EF of 65-70% , mild
hypokinesis of the distal anterior and septal walls , trace MR ,
mild AI and aortic stenosis ( aortic valve area 0.9 to 1.0 ). The
patient also has a history of hypertension with known unilateral
renal artery stenosis. The patient was initially on lisinopril ,
nicardipine , clonidine patch , and Imdur. The patient's ACE
inhibitor was held prior to cath because she was persistently
hyperkalemic. Her systolic blood pressure remained between
130-160. The patient will be discharged on a lower dose of
lisinopril ( with close followup by her primary care physician ).
Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry. She showed
sinus bradycardia in the 40s to 60s with first-degree block. The
patient was asymptomatic.
2. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath on admission thought to be a
combination of COPD , recent upper respiratory infection with
question of a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray as well
as volume overload. The patient was continued on her nebulizers.
She was also diuresed. She also completed a course of
azithromycin/cefotaxime for community-acquired pneumonia. Her
shortness of breath greatly improved since the time of admission.
Her oxygen saturation was 99-100% on room air ( and with
ambulation ) at the time of discharge.
2. Renal: The patient has a history of chronic renal
insufficiency , microalbuminuria , and renal artery stenosis. She
had a recent episode of acute renal failure in the setting of
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Her creatinine was 1.8 to
2.0 through most of this admission. She underwent renal artery
angiography on 9/18/2005 , which shows moderate stenosis of the
right renal artery. No stent was placed. She was given
Kayexalate as needed for hyperkalemia. Her ACE inhibitor was
held temporarily and restarted at a lower dose given
hyperkalemia. Her K was 4.6 at the time of discharge. In
addition to the patient's ACE inhibitor , Lasix , allopurinol , and
colchicine were held prior to cardiac catheterization. She was
given Mucomyst and intravenous fluids around the time of her
catheterization. Her creatinine improved after cath hydration to
1.6 on the day of discharge.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. She was
continued on Lantus with an insulin sliding scale.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient complained of right great toe
pain. This was thought to be a bunion versus the patient's gout.
Given increased redness , warmth , and swelling the patient was
treated for a gout flare. She was given colchicine ( renally
dosed ) and continued on her prophylactic allopurinol. Both of
these medications were held prior to cath. NSAIDs were avoided
given renal insufficiency. The patient was given Tylenol for
pain with good effect. The patient showed decreased pain and
swelling of her right great toe over the course of this admission
and this was resolved on discharge. The patient will be
continued on renally dose prophylactic allopurinol.
5. Heme: The patient had a drop in hematocrit on 9/24 from 30
to 23. She was guaiac negative. She was transfused and then
maintained to hematocrit of approximately 30 since 7/9/2005.
Her post cath hematocrit was 27.9 ( repeated at 28.9 ). Her groin
site was clean , dry , and intact. No tenderness over the abdomen
and flank.
6. Prophylaxis: Nexium and subcu. heparin.
7. Code was full.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged to home. She will
follow up with her primary care physician. She was also
instructed to avoid foods that were high in salt and potassium.
She was instructed to keep track of her daily weight.
