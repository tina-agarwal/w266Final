PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
HYPERTENSION.
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
PROCEDURES: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING TIMES THREE
WITH RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY AND LEFT ANTERIOR
DESCENDING ARTERY ENDARTERECTOMY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 37-year-old
gentleman with known coronary artery
disease admitted for pre-coronary artery bypass grafting
evaluation. The patient's cardiac history dates back to the fall
of 1989 when the patient began to experience exertional angina.
The patient has been followed for his angina since that time.
Currently , the patient experiences angina at the end of most work
days. In light of his young age , he was referred for cardiac
catheterization and probable coronary artery bypass grafting.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent cardiac catheterization
on 8/10/91 .  This showed severe triple vessel
disease with an essentially normal left ventricle. Thus , the
patient was taken to the Operating Room on 8/26/91 .  Under general
endotracheal anesthesia , the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with bilateral internal mammary
arteries. The left internal mammary was taken to the left anterior
descending and the right internal mammary artery was taken to the
right coronary artery. The saphenous vein graft was taken to the
first obtuse marginal branch. The patient was found to have
extremely pronounced atherosclerosis of his coronary arteries.
There were no apparent complications and the patient was taken to
the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. Postoperatively , the
patient had an entirely smooth postoperative course. He was
maintained on low molecular weight Dextran for 48 hours for his
endarterectomy. The patient was started on enteric coated aspirin
on the first day of his operation. The patient was extubated and
all his chest tubes and mediastinal tubes were removed. The
patient diuresed very well and was started on beta blockers. The
patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia for
the entire postoperative course.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS: On discharge included Tenormin , 75 mg
po q day; enteric coated aspirin , one po q day; Carafate , 1 gram po
q.i.d.; iron sulfate , 325 mg po q day; Percocet and Colace.
