ATTENDING: RANDOLPH DAN OPHEIM MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 66-year-old gentleman who was noted to have an
abnormal electrocardiogram during preoperative testing for his
right shoulder surgery. The patient underwent stress test , which
showed areas of ischemia. The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on 10/1/04 which revealed a left anterior
descending coronary artery with an osteal 90% stenosis , the ramus
coronary artery with an ostial 70% stenosis , first diagonal
coronary artery with a mid 90% stenosis , a 3rd diagonal coronary
artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , left circumflex coronary
artery with a proximal 75% stenosis , right coronary artery with a
50% ostial stenosis , posterior descending coronary artery with a
proximal 90% stenosis , a right dominant circulation and right
renal artery stenosis of 75 80%. Echocardiogram on 4/27/04
revealed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral insufficiency ,
trivial tricuspid insufficiency , low normal to borderline reduced
overall left ventricular systolic function , not quantified. The
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation which was treated in
the past with propafenone which is currently resolved and he has
history of myocardial infarction. He also has a history of class
III heart failure with marked limitation of physical activity.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus , dyslipidemia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,
benign prostatic hypertrophy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ,
no known episodes since 1995 , nephrolithiasis , and bursitis of
his right shoulder. History of hepatitis type unknown and renal
artery stenosis and renal insufficiency. He is status post left
rotator cuff repair in 1991.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has allergies to procainamide which causes diarrhea
and arthralgias and verapamil which causes difficulty
concentrating and constipation.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Toprol 25 mg once a day , lisinopril 10 mg once a day , propafenone
150 mg once a day enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg once a day ,
Rhinocort , simvastatin 20 mg once a day , metformin 500 mg once a
day , and glyburide 5 mg twice a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or
heaves , peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally throughout.
Respiratory breath sounds clear bilaterally , is otherwise
noncontributory.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was brought to the operating room on 4/15/04 where
he underwent an urgent coronary artery bypass graft x5 with left
internal mammary to left anterior descending coronary artery
saphenous vein graft to the first diagonal coronary artery. A
right internal mammary artery to the ramus coronary artery , a
left radial artery to the second left ventricular branch and
sequential to the first left ventricular branch. Total bypass
time was 159 minutes , total cross clamp time 110 minutes. The
patient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass without
incident , was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus
rhythm and stable condition with intravenous insulin.
Postoperatively , the patient did show his atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter which was treated Lopressor , diltiazem ,
propafenone. He was extubated and placed on his preoperative
inhalers for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He did
have a left-sided pleural effusion which was tapped on 1100 cc of
bloody fluid on 6/15/04. Post-tap chest x-ray revealed a small
left residual effusion and no pneumothorax. The patient was
slightly hypertensive due to renal artery stenosis and initially
low urine output. Renal ultrasound revealed equal size kidneys
and no hydronephrosis. His oliguria was blood pressure dependent
and he did resume urination without use of diuretics. The
patient was also followed by the diabetes mellitus service for
his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was put back on
his preoperative dose of glipizide. The patient was transferred
to the step-down unit on postoperative day #6. He did complain
on 2/15/04 of left eye black spot in the middle of his left eye.
The patient was seen by the ophthalmology service which was felt
that this was due to his diabetic retinopathy. The patient will
follow up as an outpatient with his local ophthalmologist; his
symptoms have resolved. The patient required vigorous diuresis
and was sent home on Lasix 20 mg once a day for 5 days.
DISCHARGE LABS:
For the patient on 4/12/04 are as follows: Glucose 147 , BUN of
16 , creatinine 1.3 , sodium 139 , potassium 4.2 , chloride of 106 ,
CO2 25 , magnesium 2.2 , WBC 9.27 , hemoglobin 10 , hematocrit 30.5 ,
platelets of 294 , PT INR 1.3.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Diltiazem 15 mg 3 times a day for his radial artery harvesting
and Lasix 20 mg once a day for 5 days , glipizide 10 mg in the
morning and 10 in the evening , lisinopril 10 mg once a day ,
niferex 150 mg twice a day. Propafenone hydrochloride 150 mg 3
times a day , Toprol XL 25 mg once a day , potassium chloride slow
release 10 mEq once a day for 5 days and Nexium 40 mg once a day ,
full strength aspirin 325 mg once a day , simvastatin 20 mg once
in the evening.
