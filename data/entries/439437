ASSESSMENT: 56 yo woman with MR and PAF admitted with symptoms of heart
failue most likely related to chronic worsening MR.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
**CV:
I: No evidence ichemia , no known CAD. Continued on ASA , statin.
P: MR secondary to RHD. Current sx heart failure likely related to
worsening MR. Ms. Malawy responded very well to diuresis with improvement
in her dyspnea , orthopnea , cough and wheeze. She was discharged on a
standing dose 40 po lasix qd and was instructed to follow up with
Dr. Reaver for discussion of future management options including MVR

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Resume all your normal home medications at the doses you were taking.
2. Your new medication is lasix , which helps remove excess fluid from the
body. Have your blood chemistries checked ( potassium , magnesium )
3. Make an appointment to see Dr. Madina within one week.
4. Ask Dr. Slappy to check your EKG on dofetilide to make sure that your
"QTc" ( heart function ) is not long due to metformin + dofetilide
5. Your sugars have been mildly elevated ( 190s ). Have your sugars
checked as meds adjusted as an outpt
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. follow up ECHO - Dr. Toner will compare in-patient ECHO and priors
to determine interval change in valve function , ?when to undergo repair
vs. replacement
2. optimize medical regimen for management of mitral regurgitation ,
lasix + consider hydral + nitrates for afterload reduction ( pt was
told she had ?'lupus like' symptoms on lisinopril ). ACE-I would be
best if she can tolerate this
