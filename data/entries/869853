Discharge Date: 0/16/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Trudell is a 69 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , status post an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in
March 1996. She had a cardiac catheterization at the time , which
showed an 80% mid left anterior descending artery lesion , and 80%
left circumflex lesion before OM1 , 50% proximal right coronary
artery lesion , and an 80% posterior left ventricular branch lesion.
She was also noted to have inferior and anterolateral HK with an
ejection fraction of 52%. The patient expressed her desire to be
managed conservatively , and was medically managed for the following
year. She had a sub-max exercise tolerance test prior to discharge
and one month later had a full BRUCE protocol going six minutes
with less than 1 mm ST segment depressions in several leads. The
patient did well for the past year without symptoms until 1:00 a.m.
on the morning of admission when she woke from sleep with
substernal chest pain. She took sublingual nitroglycerin with
relief after half and hour but at 3:00 a.m. the pain recurred with
nausea. The patient took two sublingual nitroglycerin with
resolution of the pain by 4:00 a.m. She presented to the emergency
department free of pain and electrocardiogram at the time showed
changes consistent with anterior ischemia. The patient was
admitted with unstable angina for evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for coronary artery disease ,
hypertension , status post cholecystectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include simvastatin 10 mg q.h.s. ,
sublingual nitroglycerin , enalapril
5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: She had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pulse of 62 , regular and blood
pressure 160/80 , respiratory rate 12 , oxygen
saturation of 99% on three liters nasal cannula. There was no
evidence of jugular venous distention , carotids 2+ bilaterally , no
bruits. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm and an S4 was
present. Abdomen was obese , soft , nontender and nondistended with
normal bowel sounds present. Extremities were without edema.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission the patient's initial CK was 111.
Her second CK was 452 , with an MB fraction of
45.1 , third CK was 550 with an MB fraction of 47.9 , and a fourth CK
of 439 with MB fraction of 33.5 , fifth CK of 261 , with MB fraction
of 14.9 , and a sixth CK of 156. SMA seven was normal.
Troponin I was 0.0 on admission. White blood count of 11 ,
hematocrit 39.7. Chest x-ray was unremarkable for any infiltrate
or any congestive heart failure evidence. Electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm at 75 , axis 0 , 2 to 3 ST segment
elevation in V1 through V3 , 1 mm elevation in V4 , less than 1 mm ST
segment depressions in 1 , AVL , and V5 , V6. These changes were new
compared to a previous electrocardiogram from March 1996.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to CCU , at which time
she was pain free and her electrocardiogram
abnormalities had resolved. Her heart rate and blood pressure were
controlled with intravenous medications and she was managed
medically until hospital day three when she was taken of the
cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac catheterization
revealed a 90% plus left anterior descending artery lesion distal
to D1 with evidence of thrombus , 60% proximal left circumflex
lesion with diffuse disease in the OM1 , a 40% right coronary artery
lesion , left ventriculogram revealed anterior lateral apical and
septal HK and AK. The patient returned to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory the following day for PTCA and stenting
of her left anterior descending artery lesion followed by ReoPro
infusion. From the time of her admission to the Cardiac Care Unit
throughout her hospital stay the patient did not have recurrence of
her chest pain. Cardiac enzymes returned to baseline.
Electrocardiogram revealed ST segments also returned to baseline.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Include aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Ticlid 250
mg p.o. b.i.d. for 11 days , Atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enalapril
20 mg p.o. q.d. The patient is instructed to resume a low fat , low
cholesterol diet. Activity as tolerated.
FOLLOW-UP: With Dr. Kroell on 10/10/97 at 3:50 p.m. and will
also follow-up with Dr. Brendlinger in the end of November or
beginning of May , to be arranged.
