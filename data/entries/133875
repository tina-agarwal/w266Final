Discharge Date: 0/14/2007
ATTENDING: LESKY , LONNIE MD
SERVICE:
Cardiac Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Serafine is a 78-year-old gentleman who presented with
increasing dyspnea on exertion and New York Heart
Association Class III heart failure. The patient also complained of fatigue
over the last four years prior to admission. He currently denied
any angina , diaphoresis , nausea , orthopnea , PND , presyncope or
syncope. The patient had been treated with serial transthoracic
echocardiograms which revealed an ejection fraction worsening
from 60% down to 40% along with aortic stenosis. The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization , which revealed no significant coronary artery disease
and elevated left and right
heart filling pressures. Cardiac catheterization was abandoned
prematurely due to the increasing filling pressures. Echocardiogram was
performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 40% , aortic stenosis with a
mean gradient of 31 mmHg , a peak gradient of 50 mmHg , calculated valve
area of 0.7 cm2 , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency , mild left atrial enlargement , moderately
hypertrophied left ventricle , global reduction in left
ventricular function more in the apex of the left ventricle
mildly enlarged right ventricle with preserved right ventricular
function , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve with
significant restriction and leaflet excursion , reduction left
ventricular function compared to previous transthoracic echo one
year prior to this present study.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for class III heart failure with marked limitation of
physical activity , diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent ,
dyslipidemia , cardiac arrest , status post cardiac catheterization
on 4/25/05 .  The patient's course was complicated by marked
bradycardia requiring insertion of a temporary pacemaker via a
right internal jugular and then complete heart block requiring a
St. Jude dual chamber pacemaker and generator.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for permanent pacemaker placement , status post
cholecystectomy , history of skin cancer , and status post
tonsillectomy.
ALLERGIES:
Patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol 12.5 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , metformin 500 mg
b.i.d. , and Humalog insulin 12 units q.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Per physical exam , 5 feet 10 inches tall , 138 kilograms ,
temperature 96 , heart rate 80 and regular , blood pressure right
arm 110/65 , left arm 112/60 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate , and rhythm with 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur. Peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally
throughout. Respiratory: Breath sounds clear bilaterally.
Neurologic: Alert and oriented with no focal deficits ,
otherwise noncontributory.
ADMISSION LABS:
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride of 106 , CO2 27 , BUN of 13 ,
creatinine 0.8 , glucose 156 , and magnesium 1.9. WBC 5.91 ,
hematocrit 46 , hemoglobin 16.4 , platelets of 181 , 000 , PT of 12.9 ,
PT/INR of 1 , and PTT 28.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Delcour was brought to the operating room on 11/0/07
where he underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement
with a 25-mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve. Total bypass
time was 101 minutes , total crossclamp time was 63 minutes. Intraoperatively ,
the patient was found to have a calcified trileaflet
aortic valve. The patient came off bypass without incident , was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit on 3 mcg of epinephrine and insulin and
Precedex. The patient did well and was brought up in stable
condition in normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively , the patient
was extubated and the Electrophysiology Service was consulted to
evaluate his internal pacemaker which was reprogrammed and
functioning well. The patient continued to require vigorous
diuresis with a Lasix drip. He was extubated on postoperative day #1 without
incident. The patient was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day 5. The patient experienced some postoperative
tachycardia and his beta-blocker was increased with good result.
He was also found to have a positive urinary tract infection and
was started on ciprofloxacin for a total of five days. The
patient at one point required 5 liters of nasal cannula to get
his saturations in the 90s. He did continue to require
intravenous Lasix but had weaned Lasix drip and had intermittent
boluses of 40 mg IV to promote diuresis with good result. He was
weaned off his oxygen and the patient began to ambulate and was
cleared for discharge to home with visiting nurse on
postoperative day #9.
DISCHARGE LABS:
Are as follows sodium 139 , potassium 4.0 , chloride of 102 , CO2 of
30 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 163 , magnesium 1.8 , WBC 9.52 ,
hematocrit 33.1 , hemoglobin 10.8 , platelets of 286 , 000 , PT 14.6 ,
PT/INR of 1.1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Are as follows: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg q.6h. for remaining four
doses , baby aspirin 81 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , for three
days along with potassium chloride slow release 20 mEq b.i.d. for
three days , Motrin 400 mg q.8h. p.r.n. pain , NovoLog 24 units
subq q.a.c. , Lantus 60 units subcutaneous q.10 p.m. , Toprol-XL
