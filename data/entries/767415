Discharge Date: 9/28/1991
HISTORY: The patient is a 62 year old rug
salesman admitted with increasing
angina. In 1981 he was first diagnosed with exertional chest
pain and hospitalized for a strongly positive stress test
catheterization at Gapi Nic, Health with an 80%
proximal circumflex and 50% left anterior descending coronary
artery.
Since that time he has been managed medically and recently felt
that his angina consisted of chest aching , throat aching and
dryness of the throat. This worsened.
On January , 1991 he had an exercise treadmill test. He went
eight minutes and 0 seconds and attained a peak heart rate of
110 , 70% of predicted and a peak blood pressure of 198/90. The
test was stopped due to 1 mm ST depression in Leads II , III , F
and V4 to V6. He developed chest discomfort. Normal blood
pressure responds to exercise and the ischemic changes were
similar to previous tests on August , 1989 but a lower exercise
capacity. His exercise discomfort is exertional and he used to
notice it when he carried his golf bag up a hill.
Yesterday he noticed more frequent anginal pain , with throat ,
chest and chest pressure and both arms aching with dull pain
while playing golf. He noticed the symptoms around the third
hole. He was then able to play up to the 14th hole walking. He
took one nitroglycerin and was able to finish to the 18th hole.
On the day of admission he noticed some pain at work while moving
around the office , but it did not last long enough for him to
take a nitroglycerin.
Medications on admission; LoPressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg p.o. t.i.d , Xanax 0.25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. p.r.n. , one aspirin q.d. and p.r.n. nitroglycerin.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. On January he had a
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in which a
proximal circumflex was dilated from 95% to 20%. The only other
lesion was a right coronary artery of 30%.
The patient's post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
course was complicated by nausea and vomiting. A KUB was non-
specific. The patient's nausea and vomiting resolved over a
course of two days and he remained well and was able to tolerate
p.o. intake well. Throughout his episodes of nausea and vomiting
the electrocardiogram remained unchanged and he denied any of his
usual anginal symptoms.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in
excellent condition on LoPressor
50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg
p.o. t.i.d. , one aspirin q.d. and Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
