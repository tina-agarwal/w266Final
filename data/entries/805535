PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure was 140/80. She is 4'10"
tall and 168 lb. In general , she ambulated
with an antalgic gait on the right with a cane. She required
assistance to get onto the examination table. Head , eyes , ears ,
nose , and throat were significant for pupils being equal and
reactive to light with extraocular muscles intact , and normal
pharynx. There was no evidence of carotid bruits. Her lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her heart was regular in rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. There was no murmur. Her
abdomen was protuberant , but nontender with no organomegaly. There
was a well healed midline incision consistent with cesarean
section. There were no focal neurological deficits. Examination
of her extremities revealed bilateral varus with the right greater
than the left. Active range of motion of the right knee was from a
15 degree extension deficit to approximately 70 degrees. There was
palpable crepitus. She had positive medial and lateral joint line
tenderness. The knee appeared stable to valgus and varus stresses.
She had a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior fullness with no

discontinue use of Indocin.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the Operating Room on

arthroplasty with a Kinemax system. Estimated blood loss was 300
cc. The tourniquet time was 90 minutes. She received
perioperative antibiotics and was continued on Coumadin in the
postoperative period. Her pain was well controlled with the use of
a PCA pump provided by the anesthesiology department. Her
postoperative course was , for the most part , uncomplicated. She
did have some low grade temperatures with a T max up to 101.8
postoperatively. This seemed to be related mostly to atelectasis.

blood transfusions. On postoperative day two , her white blood cell
count was 13.7 , but had decreased by postoperative day three to 12.
Her electrolytes were well controlled. She was made therapeutic on
Coumadin by postoperative day two with a PT of 16.4 and an INR of
2.0. She worked with the physical therapy department along the
total knee arthroplasty pathway. Her skin dressings were taken
down and the wound was noted to be clean , dry , and intact with no
evidence of erythema or discharge. The patient was felt to be
doing well , although a little bit slow in terms of her physical
therapy. It was felt that she would benefit from a short stay at a
rehabilitation hospital and a consult was placed with the Maldharp Drugties Bamayhost Memorial Hospital .  The patient was discharged to Tion Pidesf Medical Center pending bed
