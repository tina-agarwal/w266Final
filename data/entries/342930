PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
PSORIASIS.
CERVICAL DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE.
STATUS POST COLECTOMY.
STATUS POST RIGHT HERNIA REPAIR.
KNOWN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
STATUS POST NON Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
IN 1989.
STATUS POST LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING
PTCA IN 1989.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old white
male with known cardiac disease ,
status post non Q wave myocardial infarction in 1989 , status post
left anterior descending PTCA in 1989 , who was admitted following
an episode of post myocardial infarction chest pain from an outside
hospital. Cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,
hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , history of tobacco , history of
myocardial infarction. Cardiac history dates back to 3/14 when the
patient experienced substernal chest discomfort and ruled in for
non Q wave myocardial infarction. A cardiac catheterization showed
95% left anterior descending lesion , left circumflex 70% lesion and
diffuse right coronary artery disease. He had PTCA of the left
anterior descending lesion and did well for approximately two
months but was readmitted at that time in 1/6 with recurrent chest
discomfort. A cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 30%
left anterior descending lesion , 40% circumflex lesion and 80% OMB3
lesion and 50% mid and distal RCA stenoses. He had no angina until
approximately two days prior to admission when he presented to an
outside hospital with substernal chest discomfort. He rule in for
an inferior myocardial infarction with CK peaking at 2316. He was
treated with morphine , IV nitroglycerin , aspirin , heparin and IV
streptokinase. He had recurrent chest discomfort post myocardial
infarction and was transferred to Vu Pe Headcount Hospitals .
HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission , the patient's medications were
optimized to increase his beta blockade.
Eventually , the patient was weaned from IV nitroglycerin and IV
heparin to oral nitrates. The patient had no further chest
discomfort during the admission and had a predischarged modified
Bruce protocol exercise tolerance test. He did have some episodes
of shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure ,
however , this resolved with Lasix. EKG was consistent with
inferior myocardial infarction on transfer. On 5/24 , he had a
modified Bruce protocol stress test for which he went nine minutes
without chest discomfort or shortness of breath. This was read as
evidence of no ischemia. The patient was discharged home on
2/13/93.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home in stable
condition. MEDICATIONS: On discharge included
diltiazem , 120 mg po b.i.d.; metoprolol , 75 mg po b.i.d.; Isordil ,
20 mg po t.i.d.; aspirin , 325 mg po q day; Glyburide , 25 mg po q
day; gemfibrosol , 600 mg po b.i.d.; omeprazole , 20 mg po q day.
