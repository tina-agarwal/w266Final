ATTENDING: DEROCHER , SHAUN ANTONIO MD
ADDENDUM:
ADMISSION TO THE ICU: 0/10/06 .
This will be the hospital course and plan as well as the
discharge medications.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Lower extremity wounds: The patient had several left lower
extremity wounds which by report had been chronic as well as a
deeper acute onset right lower extremity wound which was
ulcerated to the level of muscle. It was thought that this wound
had occurred as a result of a hematoma after incision and
drainage by Surgical Service one to two weeks prior to admission.
There was no obvious evidence of infection , however , it is
certainly possible that there is a soft tissue surrounding that
ulcer. There was some thought of whether that could be
osteomyelitis underlying the ulcer. The patient had tibial and
fibula films which at first there was some consideration of
whether there was abnormality to the bone. On further
consideration , it was felt this is most likely not the case ,
however , to evaluate more specifically a bone scan was performed.
There was no uptake in the area of that ulcer , however , there
was some mild uptake at the left Achilles tendon calcaneal
insertion and marked uptake in the T9 thoracic 9th vertebrae. A
CAT scan of the spine was performed which revealed no evidence of
infection or neoplasm but there was evidence of osteopenia and
possibly a microfracture but no evidence of real compression
fracture. The patient was seen and examined by the Vascular
Surgery Consult Service and Dr. Smallidge , her primary vascular
surgeon. Their recommendation in terms of wound dressing was
three times a day , wet-to-dry dressing changes with 4 x 8 gauze
sponges. It was recommended that the patient follow up with Dr.
Goolden in mid 9/2 .  Please call Dr. Usman 's office for an
appointment. The recommendation for three times a day wet-to-dry
dressings without additional ointments or treatments. The
patient should be followed by wound care service. In addition ,
the patient has small necrotic regions on her heels. These
should be treated with Panafil. In terms of her sacral decubitus
ulcer , the patient was seen by the Plastic Surgery Service , they
debrided the wound twice , there was minimal amount of superficial
necrotic tissue which was excised. Their recommendations for
further care were to apply one-quarter strength Dakin's solution
soaked wet-to-dry dressings to be changed twice a day for 48
hours that will be for 36 hours from discharge and then this
treatment should be changed to standard wet-to-dry dressings
twice daily to that sacral decubitus ulcer. They recommend that
she be placed on an air mattress. She should have turns at least
every 2 hours. They also recommend that her weight be kept off
the sacrum and that her nutrition be optimized. She was placed
on a multivitamin , continued on calcium , started on zinc , vitamin
C supplements as well. The patient should follow up with Dr.
Roscoe Szymonik as an outpatient. This should be scheduled by
calling 561-371-4397.
2. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted with
a low-grade temperature. It was unclear whether she had a
primary infection and what the source of that infection was.
Cultures were taken from blood , urine , and sputum. All blood
cultures were negative. Urine culture grew extended spectrum
beta-lactamase resistant Klebsiella pneumonia which was
intermediate to ciprofloxacin and sensitive to levofloxacin.
Because the patient has so little urine output it was unclear
whether at first this was a colonizer or an actual infection.
Infectious disease consultation was requested. Their
recommendations were to start ciprofloxacin and then this was
changed to levofloxacin when the final susceptibilities came back
and they continued that for a two-week course. She is currently
on levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.48h. This course will finish on
5/24/06 . Sputum cultures grew multidrug resistant Pseudomonas
aeruginosa as well as a few Acinetobacter which were also
resistant to many antibiotics. After close consultation with
Infectious Disease Consultation Service it was decided that these
were most likely colonizers. There was no evidence of an acute
pneumonia or tracheobronchitis and the patient was not treated
for her colonization with Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. In the
past she has had multiple other multiple drug resistant organisms
that grew from her sputum cultures at other institutions and it
was felt that unless she demonstrated evidence of clinical
pulmonary infection these should not be treated. Overall , her
hemodynamic status was stable and she was afebrile throughout her
course. Several days into her admission , however , she did have
one episode of low blood pressure initially treated with
intravenous fluids and then norepinephrine infusion for short
period of time. However , on repeat cuff pressure manually it was
revealed that her blood pressure actually was normal and that
there was dysfunction possibly because of her obesity of the
automatic cuff , therefore it was thought that this low blood
pressure was spurious and probably an artifact of the cuff that
was being used. So in conclusion the only medication on
discharge will be levofloxacin 500 mg q.48h. through 5/24/06 .
3. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease and atrial fibrillation. She was on Toprol 12.5 mg by
mouth two times a day throughout her stay. Her heart rate ranged
from 120s-130s when she was first admitted to 50s-60s on
discharge. This should be readdressed regularly in terms of her
need for rate control. At this point , she will be discharged on
that low dose of beta-blocker. Otherwise , she was admitted on
Coumadin with a INR of 2-3 for her St. Jude's aortic valve. Her
INR was therapeutic on admission. This was actually discontinued
after a couple of days in anticipation of a possible procedure.
It was restarted three days prior to discharge. She was on
heparin as a bridge for anticoagulation in the meantime. She
should be continued on the heparin with a goal PTT of 50-70 until
her INR is therapeutic at 2-3 and this should be rechecked to
make sure that her INR remains therapeutic. Her care was
discussed with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Sean Mesa .
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes.
Her diabetes was controlled with insulin NPH 35 units
subcutaneous every morning with a regular insulin sliding scale
every 6 hours as well. This should be continued and fingersticks
should be done every 6 hours. The patient also has a history of
hypothyroidism. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level was
checked and was found to be elevated at 14.5. Her thyroid
replacement dose was increased from 75 mcg per day to 88 mcg a
day. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level should be checked
again in four to six weeks and dose adjustment accordingly.
5. Pulmonary: The patient was continued on her mechanical
ventilation. There were attempts at lower pressure support and
even spontaneously breathing trials. She was not able to
tolerate these for a long period of time , however , it does seem
that she has improved to some degree in terms of her ventilatory
mechanics. She is currently on pressure support ventilation at
15 of pressure support and 5 of positive end expiratory pressure
with an FIO2 of 0.4. We believe that she could probably be
weaned slowly to significantly decreased pressure support and I
believe most likely she will be able at some point to be taken
off the ventilator , although this is certainly not certain. She
will be continued on her nebulizer treatments.
6. Nutrition: The patient was continued on tube feeds. She is
on full strength Nepro at 50 cc per hour. In addition , she is
getting vitamin C supplementation , ascorbic acid 500 mg by mouth
two times a day , Nephrocaps , zinc sulfate 220 mg by mouth daily
and these should be continued as indicated for her renal failure
and wound healing.
7. Psychiatric: The patient was continued on her home dose of
fluoxetine 20 mg by G tube daily and on Zyprexa 10 mg by G tube
at bedtime.
8. Prophylaxis: Throughout her stay , the patient was continued
on her home esomeprazole 40 mg by G tube twice a day and for deep
venous thrombosis prophylaxis , her INR on Coumadin remained above
1.4 and her PTT was kept therapeutic on intravenous heparin.
Intravenous heparin should be continued with PTT checks on
admission and then every 6 hours unit they were fairly stable
between 50 and 70 and that should be monitored at least daily
until her INR is stably therapeutic. It will be very important
to monitor her INR carefully while she is on levofloxacin as
well.
9. Access: The patient has a left-sided midline which was
placed in mid 0/13 .  This should be removed within the next
one week and another line placed as preferred by the
rehabilitation physician. In addition , the patient's dialysis
catheter while functional does seem to have eroded through the
skin below her clavicle. The hemodialysis service should be
aware and consider replacement as indicated. At this point there
is no indication of infection of either of those lines , however ,
she is at high risk of infection of both.
10. Renal: The patient was continued on her hemodialysis as per
the Renal Service. Please feel free to contact Dr. Napoleon R Lafevre , the patient's ICU physician here at Ciledall Hospital with any questions you may have. As noted in the
dictation , the patient should follow up within the next three to
four weeks with Dr. Mcniel of Vascular Surgery and also with the
Plastic Surgery Service.
