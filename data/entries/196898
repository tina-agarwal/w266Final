Discharge Date: 7/18/1996
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST CORONARY
ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT , RIGHT SIDED CAROTID
ENDARTERECTOMY , AND POST-OPERATIVE ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient was admitted January , 1996
with a history of one to two months of
stable exertional angina which became crescendo angina and an
exercise stress test , thallium , revealed multivessel disease.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery
bypass grafting on January ,
1996 , right carotid endarterectomy on January , 1996 , he had some
post-operative atrial fibrillation/flutter as above , he was status
post a myocardial infarction , he had a history of hypertension ,
insulin dependent diabetes times three years , and gout.
ALLERGIES: He had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Included an eight pack year tobacco history which
he quit approximately thirty years ago and he
drank alcohol socially.
FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for coronary artery disease and
questionable for diabetes mellitus.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He was a well-developed , well-nourished
white man in no apparent distress. On
transfer to Medicine , his vital signs were a temperature of 98.8 ,
heart rate of 140 in atrial flutter , blood pressure 150/70 , and
breathing at 18 with a room air saturation of 94%. HEENT:
Examination showed his extraocular muscles intact , pupils equal ,
round , and reactive to light , his right carotid endarterectomy had
Steri-Strips , his left carotid pulse was 2+ without bruit , he had
no lymphadenopathy , and his oropharynx was benign. LUNGS: Clear
bilaterally. CARDIAC: Examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm and he was tachycardic without a murmur. ABDOMEN:
Examination showed that bowel sounds were present and it was
benign. EXTREMITIES: Examination showed no clubbing , cyanosis , or
edema , posterior tibial pulses were 2+/2+ , and his dorsalis pedis
pulses were trace bilaterally. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showed
that he was alert and oriented times three and grossly non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant for a normal SMA 7 , CBC which
had a white count of 3.7 , a hematocrit of
33.8 with 407 platelets , a sedimentation rate was 48 , his digoxin
level on transfer was 1.3 , his procainamide level was 2.6 , and his
NAPA was 1.1 on transfer. An EKG showed atrial flutter at 140.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He underwent cardiac catheterization on August , 1996 which revealed a left dominant system
with left anterior descending with serial 60% complex lesions , mid
left anterior descending 70% lesion , and a ramus 40% lesion. The
left circumflex was totally occluded proximally and the right
coronary artery was small with an 80% mid vessel stenosis. Left
ventriculogram revealed normal systolic function. On June ,
1996 , he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery with a
LIMA to his left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to his
OM1 , and a saphenous vein graft to his OM2. On March , 1996 ,
he developed atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 180 range ,
blood pressure 160/90 , he complained of palpitations , and was
diaphoretic. He received Lopressor 5 mg intravenously times two ,
his blood pressure responded with decrease to 120/72 , and his heart
rate remained in the 140 range with atrial fibrillation. He
converted to normal sinus rhythm in the eighties. He was loaded
with Digoxin and maintained on Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. That
evening , he had a second episode of atrial fibrillation. On
January , 1996 , he underwent right carotid endarterectomy for an
asymptomatic 90% stenosis. In the PACU , he had atrial fibrillation
in the 150 range with decreased blood pressure to the seventies.
On January , 1996 , he had another episode of atrial fibrillation
lasting approximately thirty minutes which converted to normal
sinus rhythm with 5 mg of Lopressor. On March , 1996 , he
converted into atrial fibrillation at approximately 4 a.m. and his
blood pressure was 160/100 , his heart rate was approximately in the
130 range , and carotid sinus pressure produced no change in his
rate. An ECG revealed a supraventricular tachycardia at 130 beats
per minute , likely atrial flutter , with 2:1 conduction. Verapamil
5 mg q.5 minutes times two intravenously resulted in a heart rate
drop from 120 to 70 which revealed atrial flutter. At this point ,
he was transferred to Medicine for further management. His
medications on transfer included magnesium and potassium sliding
scale , Axid 150 p.o. b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d. , Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , Percocet one to two tablets
p.r.n. , Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Benadryl
p.r.n. , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Procan
SR 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. started on January , 1996 , and Metamucil
p.r.n. Post-transfer , he was maintained on his cardiac regimen
overnight. He remained in atrial flutter throughout the night , was
slight diaphoretic but had no other associated symptoms. He was
cardioverted electrically on June , 1996 into normal sinus
rhythm with a heart rate in the seventies to nineties.
DISPOSITION: He is discharged on July , 1996 after
cardioversion in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 50 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Percocet one to two tablets q.3-4h. p.r.n. , Procan SR
750 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.
FOLLOW-UP: He has follow-up appointments with Dr. Musante
