Discharge Date: 8/26/2006
Date of Admission: 4/16/2006
ATTENDING: MCAFFEE , EDGARDO MD
SERVICE: Cardiac Surgery Service.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Shadler is a
54-year-old female who was found to have an abnormal EKG during a
preoperative evaluation for partial thyroidectomy , which prompted
a cardiac workup. Stress test revealed ischemic changes and
followup cardiac catheterization revealed mid right coronary
artery stenosis of 70% , proximal right coronary artery with 80%
and the left anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal
60% stenosis , left main coronary artery with a mid 70% stenosis ,
left circumflex coronary artery with a proximal 80% stenosis and
a mid 50% stenosis and a right dominant circulation.
Echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55% with trivial
mitral insufficiency and trivial tricuspid insufficiency.
Carotid noninvasives revealed that the left internal
carotid artery could not be assessed due to the patient's body habitus and
large goiter , but did reveal relatively diminished diastolic flow in the right
common carotid artery with a velocity 69 cm per second proximally and 62 cm per
second mid , 53 cm per second distally. Velocities in the left
common carotid artery 92 cm per second approximately , 62 cm per
second mid , and 73 cm per second distally. CT
angiogram of the neck on 3/10/06 revealed the following:
1. High-grade stenosis or possible complete occlusion of the
right cervical ICA at origin , the possibility of a very small
caliber residual voluminous suggested catheterization.
Angiography is recommended for further assessment.
2. Very high-grade narrowing of the left proximal ICA at its
origin by complex calcified and likely ulcerative plaque.
3. Internal carotid artery cavernous segment stenosis on the
left is likely mild-to-moderate.
4. Mild proximal basilar artery stenosis.
5. Vertebral artery origin stenosis cannot be excluded. They
are not well evaluated due to beam hardening related to body
habitus.
6. Large neurogenous thyroid lesions are most suggestive of
goiter , although more aggressive lesions cannot be completely
excluded. Clinical correlation and thyroid ultrasound could be
performed for further evaluation if indicated.
7. Cervical spine degenerative disease and stenosis in the lower
C-spine. The patient underwent repeat CT of the head and neck.
Final report is not available at this time.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for
class III heart failure with marked limitation of physical
activity , hypothyroidism , dyslipidemia , status post brain tumor
in 1973; pathology unknown , remote seizure disorder , migraines ,
goiter status post left partial thyroidectomy preoperative for a
right thyroidectomy after her coronary artery bypass grafting.
She is status post a partial oophorectomy and as stated above
craniotomy for tumor resection in 1973 and status post left
partial thyroidectomy and right breast biopsy.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to penicillin where she
develops hives.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 100 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg
daily , simvastatin 40 mg daily , vitamin C one tab daily , woman's
wellness natural hormone balance two tablets a day and Pepcid-AC
one tab as needed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Five feet six inches , 145.44 kg ,
temperature 98.6 , heart rate 70 and regular , blood pressure right
arm 140/70 , left arm 146/74. Oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or
heaves. Peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally in the
carotid , radial , femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally in the dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibialis pulses. Respiratory , breath sounds
clear bilaterally , is otherwise noncontributory.
ADMISSION LABS: Sodium 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride of 103 , CO2
29 , BUN of 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 205 , magnesium 1.9 , and
BNP is 62 , WBC 7.51 , hematocrit 38.4 , hemoglobin 12.4 , platelets
of 312 , PT 14.9 , PT/INR of 1.2 , and PTT of 26.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent left carotid artery stent
placement on 2/3/06. Coronary artery bypass grafting was
canceled due to the high-grade carotid stenosis. Operative
report is not available at this time. Postoperatively , the patient had
developed diplopia and a distant visual disturbance. CT of the
head was negative for any acute event. Neurologically , the patient's mental
status was intact , alert , oriented. The patient's neurologic
symptoms improved and she was transferred to the Step-Down Unit
on 0/14/2006 and was cleared for discharge to home on 7/0/06.
Mrs. Michand will follow up with the vascular surgeon , Dr.
Ziff , in two weeks and Dr. Liebermann will perform her coronary artery bypass
graft in four weeks. She is discharged to home in stable condition.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Plavix 75 mg , enteric-coated aspirin 325
mg a day , Motrin 400-800 mg q.6 h. p.r.n. pain , Toprol-XL 100 mg
daily , simvastatin 40 mg nightly.
DISCHARGE LABS: Glucose 101 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1 , sodium
139 , potassium 4.4 , chloride of 102 , CO2 28 , magnesium 1.9 , WBC
is 7.07 , hemoglobin 11 , hematocrit 33.3 , platelets of 274.
DISPOSITION: Ms. Hartwigsen will be discharged to home in
stable condition , will follow up with Dr. Nathan Mascot for her
coronary artery bypass grafting next month and Dr. Sandra as
stated above in two weeks for her postoperative left carotid
artery stent placement.
