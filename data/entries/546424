BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
PCP: Grady Knickelbein , Inpatient attg: Archie Derosso ,
Allergy/Immunology Attg: Morello
Primary Immunologist: Federico Kotch
ENT: Krysinski
.
RFA: Hereditary angioedema abdominal flare
.
CC: Abdominal pain
.
HPI: 83 F with hereditary angio-edema ( C1-esterase inhibitor
deficiency ) and multiple prior attacks characterized by abdominal pain
and distension and airway compromise s/p tracheostomy. She was in her
USOH until this morning when she developed worsening abdominal pain ,
periumbilical , constant. The pain was associated with abdominal
distension and typical of prior attacks. No new foods - typically these
episodes are without an identifiable precipitant. No associated
nausea/vomiting or diarrhea. + flatus , had bowel movement this AM.
Typical BM's are either watery or "pencil thin" due to colonic stricture
( s/p multiple dilatations. ) No respiratory distress , rash or hives.
She called her Allergist/Immunologist who advised her to take 2mg
Stanozolol ( instead of 1mg ) and come to the ED. In the past , abdominal
attacks have responded to FFP. Yet , given a history of hives to FFP , she
requires premedication with Benadryl.

Consults: Followed in-house by attg Loughman ( Allergy/Immuno )
Impression: Abdominal pain due to hereditary angioedema.
1. ALLERGY: Patient was admitted with abdominal pain that was similar in
nature to prior episodes of hereditary angioedema flare. She was treated
with ffp x 2units on admission with benadryl premedication. She did
develop a few facial hives without any respiratory distress by the end of
the second unit of FFP. This resolved after FFP infusion stopped and she
was given additional benadryl. She tolerated benadryl well , yet had a
sensation of restlessness afterwards. On 2/11 she got another 2 units FFP
with premedication of benadyrl 25 iv prior to each bag as well as ativan
0.5 mg po prior to transfusions. This was a good combination as she did
not get hives , nor the anxiety that accompanies benadryl. By 0/12 , her
abdominal distension had improved markedly and her pain had largely
subsided. Given the fact that prior episodes have taken a few days for
complete resolution of distension , she was discharged with instructions to
contact her immunologist should symptoms worsen or persist.
She will be discharged on a stanozolol taper as outlined by
allergy/immuno. Please see patient instructions full regimen.
.
During the hospital stay , she had no upper air way symptoms and was given
tracheostomy care.
.
ELEVATED HCT: On admission , HCT was 59 ( baselin is low 40's ). Part of the
elevation was attributed to intravascular volume depletion. Lasix was
held for 3 days and HCT was 42% on discharge. No prior documented history
of polycythemia. Please consider further evaluation as outpatient for
this erythrocytosis.
.
AFib: continued on digoxin and atenolol with good rate control ( HR 70-80s
throughout hospital stay. )
CODE: Discussed with patient. FULL CODE. Daughter hcp.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: You were hospitalized for abdominal pain due to your condition of
hereditary angioedema. You received a total of 4 units of FFP with
benadryl and pepcid premedication.
.
MEDICATION CHANGES:
Please continue all medications that you were on prior to this admission
with the following changes:
1. Please follow the stanozolol taper as outlined by Dr. Gehlert and
colleagues during your stay:
2 mg every 8 hours for 1/10/07 , then
2 mg every 12 hours for 10/2/07 , then
2 mg every day for 1 week , then
2 mg every other day.
Then you should adjust further as an outpatient in consultation with Dr.

.
Followup: schedule , with Dr. Areizaga .
Please contact Dr. Demski to discuss how you are doing.

Your abdominal pain worsens , you become more bloated or distended , you
develop nausea , vomiting , facial swelling , difficulty breathing , or any
other concerns.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:

2. Stanozolol taper
