Discharge Date: 2/11/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. ANEMIA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Christin is an 80 year old female who
presents to an outside hospital with
chest pain. She states the night prior to admission she felt some
shortness of breath and tightness in her chest upon laying down.
She took one sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. Thirty
minutes later took another sublingual Nitroglycerin , again without
relief. Shortness of breath was accompanied with increasing
feeling of chest tightness rated approximately 8/10. Took a third
Nitroglycerin without relief and felt her breathing became wheezy.
She then drove herself to an outside hospital for evaluation. She
was there treated with intravenous Lasix , morphine and
Nitroglycerin with resolution of her pain. EKG at outside hospital
showed anterolateral ST depression and her enzymes were negative
ruling out for myocardial infarction. She has cardiac risk factors
of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia and age. Her cardiac
symptomatology began in the fall of 1999 when she began to
experience chest discomfort with exertion and rest. Evaluation by
Dr. Jose Esparza showed high cholesterol with an LDL 141 , EKG with LVH
and nonspecific T wave flattening. A Thallium stress test in
November of 1999 was three minutes , fifty-two seconds duration ,
stopped secondary to shortness of breath , and there were
inferolateral ST depressions with inferior apical ischemia on
imaging. She had her symptoms managed medically with cholesterol
lowering and antihypertensive therapy.

hypercholesterolemia , angina , Paget's
disease , anemia , osteoarthritis.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed , she lives alone. Has many friends
and support in the area. Owns her own store. No

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a sodium of 140 ,
potassium of 4.4 , BUN of 40 , creatinine
of 1.6. CK of 459 with an MB of 28.7. White blood cell count of
8 , 000 , hematocrit 26.9 , platelet count 238. Urinalysis was
negative. EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats
per minute with ST segment depression V4 through V6 approximately 1
mm and approximately 1 mm ST depression in lead II.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Dison was admitted to Ster Hospital for evaluation of her angina after
ruling out at an outside hospital , however , on presentation her
laboratory values were consistent with a myocardial infarction and
her hospital course is summarized as follows.
1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Ms. Berish ruled in for a myocardial infarction
with a peak CK of 459 with an MB of 28.7. This decreased to 328
with an MB of 15.4 the following morning. Her troponin was 15.
She , however , remained asymptomatic and pain free throughout her
hospitalization. She underwent cardiac catheterization on May , 2000 which showed an okay left main , LAD with proximal 90%
stenosis , which underwent PTCA and stenting with good result , an
osteal D-1 80% lesion which underwent PTCA with good result , a
totally occluded proximal left circumflex and a right coronary with
a proximal 30% to 40% stenosis. She tolerated this procedure well
and without complications. Her medical regimen was altered to
include beta blockade , ACE inhibition and antihypertensives and
ischemics , as outlined below. Of note , left ventriculogram on her
catheterization showed anterior hypokinesis with 3+ mitral
regurgitation.
2. ANEMIA: Ms. Flewellen has a known normochromic , normocytic anemia
which was worked up during this hospitalization. She had a
hematocrit of 26.9 on admission for which she was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells. Her workup showed an iron of 74 , a
TIBC of 244 , a ferritin of 224 , B-12 of 241 ( borderline low ).
Folate and Epogen levels were pending at the time of discharge.
She also had a TSH which was normal at 2.86 , reticulocyte count of
3% and a pending serum protein electrophoresis. She was seen by
the Hematology Consult Service and was scheduled for follow-up with
Dr. Esteves in the Hematology Clinic. Her hematocrit at the time
of discharge was 30.
Ms. Bottoni was stable for discharge on February , 2000. Follow-up
with Dr. Porter Luckenbaugh in SH Cardiovascular Group on January at
1:00 p.m. and with Dr. Sammy Kleindienst in the Greenetons Opi Hospital Hematology Clinic.
