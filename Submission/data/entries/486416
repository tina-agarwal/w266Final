Discharge Date: 2/17/2005
ATTENDING: DOUGLAS SANTO FEATHEROFF MD
Of note , the patient was admitted to the CCU and then transferred
over to the Heart Failure Service mid admission.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory distress.
OTHER DIAGNOSES: CHF , hypertension , bronchospastic asthma ,
nonischemic cardiomyopathy , and pulmonary hypertension.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 63-year-old female with
hypertension , asthma with baseline PAF , peak flows of 150 to 175 ,
and history of previous nonischemic cardiomyopathy with most
recent EF of 55% on 4/14/04 as well as pulmonary hypertension
with the pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 96 mmHg , who was
in her usual state of health until three or four days prior to
admission when she developed cough and symptoms of an upper
respiratory infection. She had no reported fevers or chills. On
the day of admission , the patient was at her friend's house.
When she became acutely short of breath , EMS was called and per
report , the patient was in a tripod position , sweaty , and felt to
be in respiratory distress. In the ED , she was given 80 mg IVF
Lasix , several nebulizer treatments , and actually that was done
in field. Shortly after arrival to the ED , the patient appeared
to be in worsening distress and she desaturated in terms of her
oxygen saturation to the 70% to 80%. She was urgently intubated
and at the time of intubation , there were significant amount of
secretions/emesis in the secretions. She was given 120 mg IVF
Lasix. Chest x-ray at that time showed an infiltrate on the left
consistent with pulmonary congestion. Her BNP on admission was
591 , up from 204 on 4/14/04 . The notable labs were CK of 115
and MB fraction of 2.8 , a troponin of 0.62 , and a white blood
cell count of 11.7. Her ABG post intubation was 7.4/54/453 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. Hypertension , asthma , tobacco
use , nonischemic cardiomyopathy , and pulmonary hypertension.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Albuterol , atorvastatin , aspirin 325
mg , Flovent b.i.d. , potassium 20 mEq t.i.d. , Lasix 200 mg b.i.d. ,
lisinopril 40 mg q.d. , magnesium oxide , multivitamins , Norvasc 10
mg q.d. , Serevent two puffs b.i.d. , and Valium.
ALLERGIES: Metoprolol to which she gets bronchospasm.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She presently smokes cigarettes approximately
half a pack to one pack per day x 30 years , unknown whether she
drinks alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ARRIVAL: Temperature of 100.1 , she had a
heart rate of 53 in sinus , blood pressure 150/90 , and initial
vent settings included assist control with a tidal volume of 500 ,
breathing at 12 with an FIO2 of 100% , 93%. Exam notable for a
JVP of 8 and 9 , reactive pupils , diffuse expiratory wheezes on
pulmonary exam , irregular tachycardia , S1 , S2 , 3/6 holosystolic
murmur at the left upper sternal border , soft abdomen with
positive bowel sounds , warm extremities , 1+ pitting edema , and
notable labs were as above.
Her CCU course can be summarized by the following:
1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her pump , she as noted had
pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray and during her CCU stay ,
diuresed approximately 4.7 liters and her weight went down 6 kg.
On transfer to the floor of Cardiology Heart Failure Service , she
still appeared somewhat volume overloaded to despite 100 mg IV
Lasix q. day. In terms of her rate , she was normal. On transfer
from the CCU , she had normal sinus rhythm with occasional signs
of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , which was thought possibly due
to her pulmonary process. In terms of her ischemia , she had some
troponin leak , it was thought to be in the setting of CHF , but
that was trending downward and her blood pressure was difficult
to control likely due to medical noncompliance , longstanding
hypertension at home. She was on captopril , hydralazine , and
amlodipine.
2. In terms o her pulmonary status , there was a question of a
left infiltrate on her chest x-ray , so she was started on
levofloxacin and she was continued to be treated with Solu-Medrol
IV with switching to prednisone 60 mg p.o. Her ABG showed mild
retention that would be expected in the setting and we continued
levalbuterol nebulizers q.4h. as well as Atrovent nebulizers
q.4h. and did not start a steroid taper.
She was transferred from the CCU to the floor on the ACE , March
2005 , after five-day stay in the CCU.
Briefly , summarized her floor course by the following problems:
1. Cardiovascular: In terms of her pump , she was continued to
be diuresed down to what was thought to be a goal dry weight
between 82 and 84 kg. We were able to accomplish this diuresis
with Lasix 120 mg b.i.d. p.o. and did not need to initiate any
form of drips. We attempted to diurese her down to euvolemic
weight of approximately 84 kg on discharge. Rhythm: On the 30 of April
of March , she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular rate into the 130s and was placed on the diltiazem IV
drip titrated up to a heart rate below 100 , maximal rate reached
140 to 150. We switched to diltiazem drip over to diltiazem p.o.
t.i.d. up to a dose of eventually 150 mg b.i.d. that was then
sequentially brought down later during the admission. We also
started digoxin p.o. and started heparin for anticoagulation. It
was at that time decided that electrical cardioversion would not
be optimal in her stay , so it was decided that she would be
chemically cardioverted using the drug dofetilide. Otherwise ,
Tikosyn and we initiated the doses of dofetilide on February ,
2005 , first with the loading dose of 250 mcg and then with 500
mcg b.i.d.. She was watched carefully with EKGs before every
dose of dofetilide because of the risk of torsade de pointes and
we kept her magnesium well repleted. She tolerated the chemical
cardioversion and went back into mostly sinus rhythm without too
much ectopy or signs of any other arrhythmia , then we were able
to decrease her diltiazem down to 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. Ischemia:
She had small troponin leaks that eventually resolved , thought to
be due to failure. In terms of her cardiovascular status , a
right heart cath was done on the January , 2004 , which showed
the following pressures: RA pressures of 10 , pulmonary capillary
wedge pressures of 12 , and pulmonary artery pressures of 60 with
cardiac output of 6. Swan-Ganz catheter readings also showed
similar pressure suggesting that the causes of her respiratory
distress were more respiratory disease in nature as opposed to
CHF heart failure nature. We , of course , continued gentle
diuresis but proceeded to aggressively manage her respiratory
disease. Blood pressure: She was maintained on a regimen and
eventually discharged in regimen of hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d. ,
Isordil 40 mg t.i.d. , diltiazem 60 mg t.i.d. , and lisinopril 20
mg q.d. As her blood pressures had been hard to control , she
left here with blood pressures in the ranges of 120 to 150s/40s
to 70s.
2. Pulmonary wise , her respiratory distress seem to be more due
to her significant component of bronchospasm and slowly improved
throughout the course of admission. We did not begin the taper
of her prednisone until after she was discharged. She was
discharged on 60 mg p.o. q.d. of prednisone and we will begin to
taper after four days to 50 mg q.p.m. p.o. q.d. and then after
four days of that to 40 mg p.o. q.d. , after which the Pulmonology
Service will then determine whether she needs further tapering
and how fast to do it. She is also continued on Flovent 220 mcg
four puffs b.i.d. as well as Advair 500/50 mcg b.i.d. inhalers in
addition to her Atrovent inhalers in the morning five puffs. She
will be arranged for followup in the Pulmonary Clinic , 372-1820 ,
for management of her asthma , COPD , and pulmonary hypertension.
The pulmonary fellow input was greatly appreciated.
3. Heme: She was started on heparin because of the risk of clot
formation during her atrial fibrillation with RVR and then
transitioned to Coumadin with a dose of 5 mg of Coumadin. Should
be followed up in the Coumadin Clinic at ARVCA HEALTH NETWORK ( Onhop Fants Ho Medical Center ) who will draw her INR first starting on the
21 of January of March when she has an appointment with her PCP. Her
renal issues are creatinine , were initially bumped to 1.9 , but
came down steadily to a discharge level of 1.5. She had good
urine output and no other major electrolyte abnormalities after
her initial low sodiums. She did have persistently elevated
bicarbonate levels as would be expected. Her white count was
somewhat high , but she was on steroids and was not thought to be
infected.
She was visited often by many family members and the following
follow-up appointments were made in terms of her disposition:
She has an appointment with Dr. Kent Odonal , her primary care
physician at LISWOOD HEALTH on March , 2005. She has an appointment
with her primary cardiologist , Dr. Roman Harrington on July ,
2005. She has an appointment with the Electrophysiology Service
to follow up on her arrhythmia issues on March , 2005 , and
she will be making an appointment with the Pulmonology Service
and to followup in a few weeks for her bronchospastic issues.
She also has visiting nurses' support setup for her as well as
connection with the Coumadin Clinic at DE MEDICAL CENTER .  She was discharged
in a stable condition on August , 2005 with followup. Her
exam was essentially improved respiratory wise and unchanged
cardiac wise. She felt ready to leave.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler two puffs q.4h. ,
Atrovent inhalers two puffs four times a day , Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , diltiazem 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Flovent 220 mcg inhaled
b.i.d. , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Isordil 40 mg p.o.
t.i.d. , Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. , and simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s.
In terms of disposition , she again needs Pulmonary followup and
appointment , which the fellow said that she will be called form
the Or-low Chadi Hospital .
