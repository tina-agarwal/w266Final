HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Loften is a 62 year old woman with
cardiac risk factors including
hypertension , diabetes mellitus , postmenopausal , who presents with
exertional angina x four months. On the day prior to admission ,
she had a nondiagnostic exercise tolerance test , and was admitted
for cardiac catheterization on January , 1995. Upon further
questioning when the patient presented for catheterization , it was
found that she had a previous allergic reaction to intravenous
contrast dye that caused laryngeal edema. For that reason , the
patient was admitted for premedication overnight prior to
catheterization.
The patient , again , is a 62 year old , and is a patient of Dr.
Mayer , with multiple cardiac risk factors including hypertension ,
diabetes , elevated cholesterol , a positive family history , and
being a postmenopausal woman. She first noted exertional
substernal chest pain about four months prior to admission. The
pain radiates to her left arm , and is associated with shortness of
breath , but no diaphoresis or nausea or vomiting. The pain is
relieved by rest within two minutes , or by a sublingual
Nitroglycerin , which she has used in the past week x two. Her
exercise tolerance is limited by this pain , and is diminished to
+/- 50 yards on the flat surface at present. The patient had one
episode of pain at rest three nights prior to admission. She
denies shortness of breath , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.
She was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction on November ,
1995 , and ruled out by enzymes and electrocardiogram. She had an
echocardiogram done which revealed an ejection fraction of 60
percent , with no regional wall motion abnormalities. She had 2+
mitral regurgitation , 1+ aortic regurgitation , and 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation. The day prior to admission , she underwent an
exercise tolerance test. She went two minutes on standard Bruce
protocol , stopped secondary to diaphoresis and shortness of breath
without chest pain , and she had nondiagnostic electrocardiogram
changes. The patient was admitted for premedication for her dye
allergy and subsequently catheterization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for:
1. Hypertension.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. She has a history of a deep venous thrombosis in 1994.
5. She has chronic renal insufficiency , with a GFR of 48 , and the
twenty-four hour urine shows 3.8 grams of protein.
6. She is status post cholecystectomy.
7. She has vitiligo.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Aspirin q.d.
2. Enalapril 20 mg b.i.d.
3. Cardizem 300 mg q.d.
4. Insulin mixed 70/30 with 60 units in the morning and 30 in the
evening.
5. Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES: Her allergies include contrast dye which gives her a
rash and laryngeal edema , Penicillin which gives her
edema.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone , but has two very
supportive daughters. She has no smoking or
alcohol history.
FAMILY HISTORY: Her family history is significant for brothers who
had myocardial infarctions in their 50's and 60's ,
and a mother who had a myocardial infarction when she was 69.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination , this is a very pleasant
Clarkant Prings U woman , who speaks predominantly
Spanish , who is in no acute distress. Her vital signs were a
temperature of 98.6 , heart rate 71 , blood pressure 168/70 ,
respiratory rate 18. The remainder of her examination was
significant for flat jugular venous pressure , but questionable
bruit in the left carotid. Cardiac examination was significant for
a normal S1 and S2 , with an S3 noted , no murmur. Her extremities
showed trace edema bilaterally , 2+ pulse in the left femoral , no
pulses palpated on the right , and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Her labs are significant for a creatinine of 1.7 ,
an elevated cholesterol at 294. Her urine showed
3+ protein , 1+ glucose. Her electrocardiogram was normal sinus
rhythm at 78 , with normal axis and interval , and lateral V4 through
V6 T wave flattening.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was catheterized on January ,
1995 , with results showing proximal left anterior
descending stenosis of 50 percent , mid left anterior descending
stenosis of 70 percent. The distal left anterior descending was
diffusely diseased , and her first diagonal showed a discrete
stenosis of 80 percent. On the right , she had in the proximal
right coronary artery a discrete lesion of 50 percent , and in the
mid right coronary artery diffusely diseased at 50 percent. The
patient underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the mid left
anterior descending artery stenosis from 70 percent to 10 percent.
The patient's post catheterization course was complicated by a loss
of 150 cc of blood after her right groin sheath was removed , but
the bleeding was stopped after 90 minutes of compression. Her
hematocrit on admission was 35.9 , which dropped to 30.1 after the
sheath removal , but remained stable and she was discharged with a
hematocrit of 30.8. The patient also had one mild occurrence of
chest pain post catheterization which was relieved with two
sublinguals , and showed no electrocardiogram changes.
Upon discharge , the patient was noted to have elevated liver
function tests , with an ALT going from 16 to 156 , an AST going from
16 to 65 , an alkaline phosphatase going from 87 to 171. The
patient's primary medical doctor , Dr. Schummer , was notified and
agreed to workup the elevated liver function tests. The patient
was discharged on her admitting medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
