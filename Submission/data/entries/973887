Discharge Date: 8/17/2006
ATTENDING: DRAPEAU , TRINIDAD MD
DISPOSITION:
To home with VNA service.
PRINCIPAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post MVP with 30 Cosgrove ring , AVR with a 25 CE and PFO
closure and MAZE.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
Hypertension , diabetes mellitus type 1 , gout , paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation , prolapse mitral valve with moderate MR.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with past medical history
significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation , severe aortic stenosis and moderate MR. His
symptoms also consisted of dyspnea on exertion. He states that
he gets short of breath walking on an incline after one to two
blocks. He has no angina , orthopnea , no neurologic symptoms.
Stress echo on 10/27/06 showed no evidence of ischemia but
importantly a fall in BP with exercise and was not able to go
beyond 2.5 minutes due to fatigue. Echo also demonstrated an
aortic stenosis with a neck area of 0.9 cm2 with a peak gradient
35 , mean of 21 , and a junctional moderate MR from myxomatous
prolapse. Cardiac cath at GMH on 0/11/06 showed single-vessel
CAD involving LAD. The patient was initially scheduled to
undergo AVR , plus MVP and MAZE on 2/29/06 .  Preop chest x-ray
revealed pulmonary fibrosis and mild pulmonary edema , which was
also confirmed with CT of chest without contrast. PFTs were
suggestive of restrictive lung disease. Pulmonary service was
consulted and it is considered that the patient's fibrosis has
not progressed and that new chest x-ray changes may be likely due
to his interstitial pulmonary edema. It was suggested that the
risk of pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery would be
moderate. Carotid ultrasound showed 65-70% RCA occlusion , which
is asymptomatic. The patient is rescheduled for AVR , plus MVP
and plus MAZE on 2/5/06 . 
PREOPERATIVE CARDIAC STATUS:
Elective. The patient presented with valve dysfunction with
history of class II heart failure. Recent signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure included dyspnea on exertion/pedal
edema. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.
PREVIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS:
None.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Multiple shoulder replacement revision , status post laminectomy ,
status post cholecystectomy , status post appendectomy , status
post inguinal hernia repair.
FAMILY HISTORY:
No family history of CAD.

The patient lives at South Carolina , has remote history
of smoking , quit 30 years ago. He is a social drinker. The
patient is retired manager of Avallemina La Sto

CSS and stabilized for surgery. Date of surgery 11/5/06 . 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , aortic stenosis , and mild
mitral regurgitation.
PROCEDURE:
An AVR with a 25 CE pericardial valve. MVP with a 30
Cosgrove-Edwards ring , cleft repair , posterior leaflet , ring
annuloplasty , leaflet resection , posterior leaflet , sliding
valvuloplasty , PFO closure by atrial MAZE procedure. Left atrial
appendage resection and right atrial appendage resection.
Bypass time: 219 minutes. Crossclamp time 156 minutes. There
were no complications. The patient was transferred to the unit
in stable fashion with lines and tubes intact. In the ICU ,
starting postop day #1 , the patient was extubated , postop day #2
remains AV paced. Transferred to Step-Down Unit on postoperative
day #2.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEM:
Neurologic: Pain control , Toradol.
Cardiovascular: On Coumadin , captopril issues was being AV paced
through a.m. with transfer and now in first-degree AV block ,
holding Lopressor.
Respiratory: No issues , have been extubated postoperative day
#1.
GI: Passed speech and swallow. Diet was advanced as tolerated ,
Nexium for GI prophylaxis.
Renal: Started Lasix 20 b.i.d.
Endocrine: Diabetes insulin treatment with subq insulin.
Hematology: Anticoagulation with Coumadin , recent MAZE
procedure/atrial fibrillation.
ID: No issues.
Transferred to the Stepdown Unit where he
proceeded to progress well. Postop day #2 , chest tubes removed
wires left in. Postop day #3 , slow junctional rhythm with rates
in the 40s being externally V paced , rate of 88 and wires not
working. EP states if further rhythm is not recover by postop
day #4 to #5 to reconsult. Foley reinserted for retention of 400
mL output. Started Flomax. On low-dose Coumadin for MVP/MAZE in
case pacemaker was needed. We will need rehabilitation upon
discharge. Post-day #4 remains to be V paced with junctional
rhythm. The wires are in and do not conduct or capture. EP
feels the patient may require pacemaker , we will observe for now.
Upper extremity noninvasive studies for left greater than right
arm swelling , negative for DVT. Holding Coumadin pending
possible pacemaker placement. Past video swallow today for
regular diet.
Postop echo pending for MVP. Rehabilitation when medically
ready. Postop day #5 , postop showed slow junctional rhythm with
EP following for possible pacemaker , and they set a pacemaker at
heart rate of 40. The patient in junctional rhythm/afib , heart
rate in the 60s , A wire and do not conduct or capture. V wire
set at a backup rate of 40. EP just came by and feels patient is
likely recovered conduction. Possibly an atrial fibrillation
versus accelerated junctional with heart rates in the 80s and
thinks pacemaker will not be indicated. Plan to discontinue
wires in a.m. if the patient's rhythm remain stable.
Postop echo done for MVP. EF 55% , No comment on MR. Foley
discontinued last night after insertion voiding well today on
Flomax. Low-dose Lovenox anticipate eventual discharge to
rehabilitation on Lovenox/Coumadin and bridge after pacemaker.
White count up slightly to 11.1 low-grade temps. UA negative.
Rehabilitation when medically ready given possibility of
pacemaker requirement. Postop day #6 , spoke with EPS as the
patient is in stable sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block ,
okay to remove wires implanted for pacemaker , ambulating well for
room air. We plan to send to rehab when bed available. Postop
day #7 , the patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to
be stable to discharge to home with VNA service with the
following discharge instructions.
DIET: Low-cholesterol , low saturated fat. ADA 2100 calories per
day.
