BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 66 yo woman with a hx of CAD , emphysema , HTN , and DMII
who presents with a 2 month hx of progressive dyspnea on exertion who
was found to desat on ambulation today to the mid 80s. The patient had
a prior CABG in 1994 and underwent cath with additionally stenting in
2001. She had a recent MIBI ( 9/5 ) with nl EF and mild reversible
defects in peri-infarct territory. She had been doing well until
recently when she noted the onset of progressive dyspnea on exertion
over the last 2 months. She denies chest pain , cough , orthopnea. She
does report PND and new LE edema.
VS: 96.6 61 140/70 24 94 RA
PEx: Lungs: bilateral basilar crackles. CV: rrr , nl s1 and s2 , +s3 ,
II/VI SEM. Extr: bilateral edema over shins , non-pitting.
Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: The differential diagnosis for this patient's dyspnea
includes cardiac and pulmonary causes. Based on physical exam it was
not felt that she was in heart failure. However , with hx of CAD , this
was investigated with Echo which showd nl EF and heart function. The
Echo also showed nl RV fxn and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Chronic PE and lung parechymal diseases were investigated with chest CT
which was negative for PE. It also showed moderate to severe
centrilobular emphysema with no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. She
had PFTs the day of admission which showed decreased lung volumes all
consistent with a restrictive lung pattern. Given the diagnostic
dilemma , the Pulmonary service was consulted , which did not feel that
doe was due solely to pulm etiologies. Thus , desat is unexplained. Pt
will be sent home on o2 to be used during exertion only.
2. CV: The patient has a hx of hypertension and is being followed by
her Cardiologist Dr. Stouch . Per Dr. Hehr recommendation , her norvasc
was discontinued as was her atenolol. Desats could be
due to transient diastolic dysfunction w/ exertion. She has been
started on labetalol 400 bid at the time of discharge. Titrate up as BP
tolerates
3. PULM: will be d/c'd on albuterol inh.
4. F/U: She is discharged to home with follow-up w/ urgent care next wk
for re-exam of BP , volume status and sats w/ ambulation. Titrate
labetalol as tolerated. If LE edema persists and pt continues to desat
w/ exertion , can try lasix. If DOE still persists , consider R/L heart
cath or cardiopulmonary exercise testing
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: if you have any worsening shortness of breath , call MD immediately.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Follow-up with Dr. Paasch on March as scheduled.
2. Call Dr. Fupocyupanqui to schedule follow-up.
3. Call doctors if symptoms worsen.
4. The following are med changes:
- stop norvasc
- stop atenolol
- start labetalol 200 mg twice a day
