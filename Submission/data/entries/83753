Coags within normal limits. BNP 46 , CK-MB 0.9 , troponins
negative. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , T-wave inversions , V3
through V5. Chest x-ray shows enlarged heart with right middle
lobe opacity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary: The patient with possible right middle lobe
pneumonia versus CHF versus exacerbation versus COPD versus PE.
The patient is found to have pneumonia. She is afebrile with
normal white blood cell counts but continues to be hypoxic to the
mid 80s on room air. Sputum cultures were sent and the patient
was treated empirically with Levaquin. Levaquin was given for a
total of 8 doses in-house and the patient will continue for a
total of 14-day course. The patient had a PECT , which was
initially read was positive , however , the final read was negative
for PE. The patient initially received a dose of Lovenox 100 mg
b.i.d. but was discontinued given negative PE. The patient was
seen by Pulmonary Service who performed the bronchoscopy on
9/7/05 , which showed a copious blood-tinged mucosa and
collapsed right middle lobe lung with narrow orifice. Brushings
and cytology were taken and sent to Pathology and the results are
still pending. The patient's pulmonary function test showed
severe obstructive disease with the FEV of 0.9 with some aspects
of restrictive disease. She also underwent a bubble study , which
was negative for heart septal defects. The PA pressure was
estimated at 42. The patient then underwent a right heart
catheterization to check for vasodilator response and heart
function. This was performed on 10/28/05 , which showed high
right-sided heart pressures and a pulmonary wedge pressure of
16-18 and suggested that the patient was not in acute left heart
failure. The patient was also seen by the Ookter Highway ,
Pulmonary Hypertension Consult Service , whose impressions were
that the patient's poor pulmonary function is due to COPD and
pectus cavernosum as well as radiation for breast cancer and is
chronic condition. No indication was present for treatment with
primary pulmonary antihypertensive agents. The patient then had
a repeat chest x-ray on 10/28/05 to evaluate for the right middle
lobe , which continues to be collapsed. The patient was stable on
2-3 L of nasal cannula oxygen , saturating at about middle 90s.
The patient was re-evaluated by physical therapy on 5/18/05 and
was found to not need any particular treatments at home. The
patient was discharged to home with home O2 2-3 nasal cannula and
instructed to keep O2 saturations above 88%. The patient does
work in the hospital. The patient's work situation and
disability regarding her lung condition was discussed by the
attending physician.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient is stable with no evidence of
acute CHF , complicating dyspnea. The BNP was normal and JVP
remained relatively flat throughout her hospital course. The
patient was continued on her outpatient hypertensive medications ,
which was captopril and that was given t.i.d. with good control.
The patient was also on Lasix 40 mg daily , which was then
increased to 60 on day of discharge to encourage gentle diuresis.
3. Endocrine: The patient has diet-controlled diabetes at home.
She was on insulin sliding scale and house and required only
several units of insulin a day. Her blood sugars remained in the
mid 100s.
The patient was on Levoxyl 225 mcg daily in-house and was found
to have a increased TSH of 10.5 , therefore dose of Levoxyl was
increased to 250 mcg. The patient is instructed to follow up
with her primary care provider and her endocrinologist in two
weeks to recheck a TSH.
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient complaining of leg cramps ,
chest spasms , and back pain. Back pain appears chronic. Chest
spasms appeared to be musculoskeletal in etiology and not
cardiac. The patient was on oxycodone 5 mg q.4h. p.r.n. and then
transitioned to OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d. with good pain control.
5. Social Services: The patient was seen by Social Services
regarding prescription coverage , ability to handle copayments.
Additionally , her concerns regarding short-term disability and
long-term disability for work were addressed. The patient is to
inquire with her benefit office to determine for services.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Discharged to home with home O2.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Levaquin 500 mg daily for six more days ,
captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 60 mg p.o. daily ,
levothyroxine 250 mcg p.o. daily , Xanax 0.25 mg t.i.d. p.r.n. ,
OxyContin 10 mg p.o. q.12h. , Combivent 1-2 puffs q.i.d.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient to call if becoming short of
breath , has chest pain , fever over 100.5 or any other concerns or
questions.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: Include 9/29/05 at Bayhead Medical Center for
sleep study where the patient is to arrive before 09:00 p.m. that
night , 9/24/05 with Dr. Chesterman at 02:30 p.m. for primary care
follow-up , Dr. Hilse on 3/6/05 at 04:00 p.m. for follow-up of
pulmonary issues and a two weeks' time follow-up with her
endocrinologist regarding her thyroid condition.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: COPD , pneumonia , secondary pulmonary hypertension ,
hypothyroidism , hypertension , non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
