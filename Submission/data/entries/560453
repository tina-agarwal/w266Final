This is a 50-year-old female with a history of hypertension ,
diabetes , obesity , as well as a schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder , presents with right knee swelling , redness and pain for
one week. The patient lives alone at home and has two brothers
who periodically check in on her. She was visited by her brother
yesterday and found that her right knee had been swollen red and
tender for about a week. After he noted this , he brought her to
the emergency department. The patient states that the leg has

4. MetroGel p.o. at bedtime.
5. Lithium 900 mg at bedtime.
6. Acebutolol 200 mg daily.
7. Risperdal 0.5 mg at bedtime.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives at home alone. She smokes tobacco , but denies
ethanol. She does drink several bottles of soda per day. Her
brother , Willard Kloock , did involve in her care; his phone number
is 427-986-1973 , he can also be reached at 243-754-1828. Her
other brother , Merrill Luersen , is also involved in her care and can
be reached at 938-506-7946.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 97.5 , pulse 42 , blood pressure 107/58 , respirations
20 , and oxygen saturation 97%. In general , this is an obese
female , she is Spanish-speaking mostly. She appears unkempt and
in discomfort somewhat because of her right knee pain. She is no
acute distress. Cardiovascular exam shows bradycardia , with
normal S1 and S2 , and 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at
the left upper sternal border. Her chest exam showed some low
soft rumbling sounds with inspiration and expiration , otherwise ,
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was distended and
obese. There are positive bowel sounds , and no palpable liver
and spleen. Extremity exam showed uncut nails on upper and lower
extremities bilaterally. Her right leg was greater in size than
her left , however , both show significant 2-3+ pitting edema. On
the right ankle area , there appears to be chronic venous stasis
changes with hyperpigmented patch on the lower extremity. There
are less chronic venous stasis changes on the left lower
extremity. There was some mild erythema around the right knee.
This area of redness was poorly demarcated and mildly blanching.
There was painful passive motion on her right knee. Neuro exam
was grossly intact and nonfocal. She did have a coarse tremor in
her upper and lower extremities when asked to use these
extremities for motion.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA:
Electrolytes were significant for a potassium of 5.8 and a
creatinine of 1.6 that was raised from previous creatinine in
2004 of 1.0. Her liver enzymes were unremarkable. Her
hematocrit was 45.5. A UA done on admission was bland , however ,
urine cultures grew greater than a 1000 CFU/mL of coag-negative
Staphylococcus. Her right knee film showed mild effusion , no
fracture. This effusion was tapped and showed 20 white blood
cells , 810 red blood cells. Of the white blood cells , 21% were
PMNs and 75% were lymphocytes. There were no crystals seen.
There were no organisms seen.
ASSESSMENT:
Ms. Fought is a 50-year-old female with a history of bipolar
disorder , schizophrenia , obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension ,
and diabetes , was admitted for one week of worsening right knee
redness , swelling and pain causing immobility.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM/PROBLEM:
1. Leg swelling: The differential diagnosis that was considered
for her leg swelling included deep venous thrombosis versus
cellulitis versus septic joints versus gout versus chronic
lymphedema with an acute worsening. Infectious causes were
considered less likely given the fact that the patient's white
count was not significantly elevated , ( it was 10.5 with 75%
polys , and 80% lymphs ) , and in fact that she has not had any
fever. The patient was treated empirically , however , as this
diagnosis was unable to be ruled out initially with vancomycin
and Unasyn and then with levofloxacin. The patient was treated
with therapeutic doses of heparin because of the concern of pain
and swelling asymmetrically of the lower extremities. This
continued until lower extremity Doppler studies showed no deep
venous thrombosis in the right femoral or left popliteal veins.
Uric acid levels were checked and shown to be elevated at 8.6 and
again at 8.0. These values suggest that gout may be involved in
this problem , however , there are no crystals and the synovial
fluid making this diagnosis also less likely. Over her hospital
course , the swelling , tenderness and redness of the right knee
decreased significantly. However , the patient's left knee began
to cause her significant pain , requiring oxycodone , Tylenol and
lidocaine patch. Because of concerning renal function with a
creatinine of 1.6 from 1.0 , NSAIDs were held initially , however ,
her creatinine trended down to 1.2 on the day of discharge , and
so she will be discharged with NSAIDs , which are expected to help
her musculoskeletal pain. While in the hospital , she received
Physical Therapy who evaluated the patient and suggested that the
patient would benefit from continued direct physical therapy to
address functional mobility retraining. Short-terms goals
included ambulate 50 feet with minimal assistance with
restrictive device , and to tolerate out of bed to chair for 30
minutes with reports of fatigue.
2. Lithium toxicity: Because of the patient's coarse tremor ,
bradycardia , hypotension , and the fact that she was taking
lithium , encouraged her lithium level to be checked which came
back elevated at 2.7 , ( normal levels between 0.5 and 1.3 ). This
level was concerning because lithium has a very narrow
therapeutic window. Her lithium was held and she was treated
with IV fluids , which allowed her creatinine to decrease. It was
thought that she was also somewhat dehydrated on presentation to
the emergency department. Her lithium toxicity could in part
explain for her bradycardia and hypotension as well as her
hypokalemia and renal failure. A psych consult was obtained to
address the question of when and how to restart the lithium. The
psych consultant suggested to check lithium levels daily until
they fell below 0.5 and then should restart the lithium at 300 mg
at bedtime. On the day of discharge , her lithium level was at
1.12. This level should be checked at the nursing facility and
lithium should be restarted at 300 mg at bedtime when the level
is 0.5 or below.
3. Cardiovascular: From a pump standpoint , the patient was
hypovolemic and hypotensive on presentation to the emergency
department. She responded well to normal saline fluid boluses
and given a total of 3 liters over her hospital course. From a
rhythm standpoint , the patient's bradycardia was resolved of
either over beta blockade or lithium toxicity. Her beta-blocker
was held as well as her lithium and her heart rate improved to
the 50 and 60s. We would recommend holding the beta-blocker
until follow up at her primary care physician's office for her
next appointment. From an ischemia standpoint , EKG was performed
which was a poor study that showed perhaps some T-wave inversions
in aVL. However , ACS is unlikely at this time. The patient had
no chest pain.
4. Renal: Acute renal failure on presentation with a creatinine
of 1.6 and 1.0 is likely prerenal versus lithium toxicity versus
a combination of these. A creatinine improved to 1.2 on the day
of discharge.
5. Endocrinology: The patient had a history of diabetes
according to her medical records. Her glucose while admitted
here was in between 90 and 132. These were random glucose draws.
Hemoglobin A1c was checked which came back at 6.2. At this
time , diabetes may or may not be an appropriate diagnosis for her
and she should follow up with her primary care physician with a
fasting blood glucose test.
6. Infectious disease: On initial presentation , the patient
presented with hypotension in the setting of bradycardia and beta
blockade with decreased volume status. There was a concern
initially that this may be cellulitis and she was covered broadly
with Unasyn and vancomycin. However , as she improved , and the
redness and swelling decreased , she was switched to levofloxacin
and committed to complete a seven-day course. She will complete
six more days after discharge from the hospital of levofloxacin.
7. Deconditioning: As mentioned above , Physical Therapy was
consulted and the patient will go to nursing facility for a
temporary rehabilitation. Upon discharge to her home from rehab ,
home safety evaluation should take place to make sure that the
patient is okay to go back home and can give the services that
she needs.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.
2. Klonopin 1 mg p.o. at bedtime.
3. Oxycodone 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain , please hold
if respiration rate is less than 12.
4. Risperdal 0.5 mg p.o. at bedtime.
5. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. daily for six days after the day of
discharge from Wilgeimante Eycis Health on 0/19/05.
6. Ibuprofen 600 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pain.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged in stable condition to a nursing
facility. Please draw blood for lithium level checks daily until
it is below 0.5 , at which time , she should be restarted on
lithium 300 mg p.o. at bedtime. She will follow up with her
primary care physician , Dr. Aurelio Gilberto Hencheck at Li County Hospital , phone number is 156-903-7650. A message
was left in the voice mail of her physician's office to schedule
her an appointment and to contact her brother , Oren Dad , at
phone number 427-986-1973 or 683-173-8613 , or Daren Perella at
990-786-9092 to inform them at when the appointment will be. It
was requested that she be seen within two to three weeks.
