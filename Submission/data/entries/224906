Discharge Date: 0/12/1994
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA/CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1 ) HYPERTENSION.
2 ) HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
3 ) TOBACCO USE.
4 ) DIABETES MELLITUS.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54 year old woman
with longstanding hypertension ,
coronary artery disease ( status post two vessel coronary artery
bypass graft in 1992 ) , hypercholesterolemia , positive tobacco use ,
positive family history for coronary artery disease , adult onset
diabetes mellitus , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , peptic
ulcer disease ( with history of gastrointestinal bleed ) , and stable
angina who presented with rest angina in a crescendo pattern not
relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient had no chest
pain history until 1992 when she presented with chest pain and had
a markedly positive exercise tolerance test. She had recurrent
typical chest pain and fatigue at 3 minutes and 45 seconds on
standard Bruce protocol with a maximal heart rate of 129 , maximal
blood pressure 120/80 , and 1 mm ST depressions. Patient was
treated medically but returned with chest pain at rest. Cardiac
catheterization revealed single vessel coronary artery disease ( 80%
mid right coronary artery ) for which a PTCA was attempted but was
complicated by dissection so the patient had an emergent saphenous
vein graft to the right coronary artery and LIMA to the left
anterior descending. Patient was on an intraaortic balloon pump
when she developed a cold right lower extremity and had an emergent
right femorofemoral bypass. The patient did well until 2/23 ( with
rare episodes approximately four per year of rest angina which
began approximately six months post-coronary artery bypass graft
and were all relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin ) when she
developed worsening right lower extremity claudication requiring
angioplasty. In 3/0 , recurrent right lower extremity
claudication prompted a femoropopliteal bypass. The patient was
now currently contemplating repeat femoropopliteal bypass. On the
day of admission , the patient had an approximately four hour
episode of chest pain while visiting with her daughter. The
patient did not have sublingual nitroglycerin with her at the time.
Upon returning home , the patient obtained relief with one
sublingual nitroglycerin ( patient had described the pain at 9/10
with left chest to axilla pain and no other radiation ). The
patient was able to sleep. The patient awoke in the morning and
shortly thereafter , had chest pain which was not relieved with one
sublingual nitroglycerin. Therefore , the patient came to the
Emergency Department. The patient had repeat episodes of chest
pain while in the Emergency Department and no EKG changes were
noted. Two sublingual nitroglycerins resolved each episode.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Longstanding hypertension. 2 ) Peptic
ulcer disease/upper gastrointestinal bleed
in the 1970s. The patient had an upper GI series/colonoscopy which
were negative per the patient. The patient had an ongoing stable
pattern of gastritis/gastroesophageal reflux disease that was
minimized by avoiding fatty foods. 3 ) Adult onset diabetes
mellitus. 4 ) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no
hospitalizations or intubations and currently not on any therapy.
5 ) Hypercholesterolemia. 6 ) Vascular disease as above. 7 )
Status post herniated disc.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lopressor 50 mg/25 mg/50 mg , Pepcid 20
b.i.d. , Procardia XL 60 q.d. , enteric coated
aspirin 500 mg q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. , Elavil 50 mg
q.h.s. , and K-Dur 20 mEq q.d.
ALLERGIES: 1 ) Amoxicillin which caused hives and a rash. 2 )
Fish which caused nausea , vomiting , and pruritus.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was a retired operating room
technician. 2 ) Patient had significant tobacco
use of three packs per day times 35 years decreased to one pack per
day in the last two years. 3 ) Alcohol was none since 1992 with
one beer per night prior to that.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother who died of a cerebrovascular accident ,
otherwise non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This revealed an obese middle-aged woman who
was feisty but in no acute distress. Her
temperature was 98.2 , heart rate 84 , blood pressure 122/74 , and
respiratory rate 16. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact , pupils
equally round and reactive to light ( but left slower to react ) and
oropharynx benign. NECK: No lymphadenopathy , thyromegaly without
nodular feeling , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugular venous
pressure approximately 7 cm. LUNGS: Coarse dry crackles at the
bilateral bases with decreased breath sounds throughout. CARDIAC:
Point of maximal intensity was not appreciated , regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 , S2 was split , and no S3 , S4 , or murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , non-distended , obese with no
hepatosplenomegaly , and no femoral artery bruits with 1+ palpable
pulses bilaterally. EXTREMITIES: Trace pretibial edema
bilaterally with 1+ right dorsalis pedis pulse and trace left
dorsalis pedis pulse. RECTAL: Occult blood negative ( per
Emergency Department physician ). NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly non-focal
except for 4/5 right lower extremity proximal muscle strength , 1+
deep tendon reflexes throughout , and toes downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was notable for a hematocrit
of 49 and first CK of 19. Chest x-ray
showed no active disease. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm of 90 ,
axis 70 degrees , normal intervals , no ST or T wave changes , no left
ventricular hypertrophy , and no change as compared with 3/0 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was first ruled out for a myocardial
infarction and the patient did , in fact , rule
out. The patient did have some recurrent chest pain episodes
in-house , again with no EKG changes , relieved with sublingual
nitroglycerin. Her anti-ischemic regimen was intensified and the
patient underwent a dobutamine MIBI which revealed inferior
ischemia with a minimal work-load. Cardiac catheterization
revealed that her saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery
had stenosed which was successfully PTCA to 20% residual stenosis.
Slow competitive flow was seen in the LIMA but the LIMA to the left
anterior descending was patent. The patient did well
post-procedure.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home with close follow-up by
her primary physician.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Atenolol 100 mg q.d. 2 ) Lasix 40 mg
q.d. 3 ) Vasotec 10 mg q.d. 4 )
Nitroglycerin sublingually p.r.n. 5 ) Axid 150 b.i.d. 6 ) Serax
