Discharge Date: 3/7/1990
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1 )MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
2 )CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
3 )HYPERTENSION.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 60-year-old white
male who presented with a two week
history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion
admitted with new EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction
for rule out MI. The patient's cardiac risk factors are diabetes ,
hypertension , distant smoking history. There is no history of
increased cholesterol and no family history of heart disease. The
patient noted the onset of exertional shortness of breath around
the beginning of 7 of August .  At that time the patient was experiencing
increased stress because of the recent death of the patient's
sister-in-law. The patient consulted his local physician , Dr.
Bret Langner , on 7 of April .  An EKG at that time showed no change
from an EKG of a year earlier. Over the next week the patient
reported feeling weak , general malaise , experienced occasional
chills with continuing dyspnea on exertion. There was one event on
20 of February where the patient experienced chest pain with severe
diaphoresis and a chill which he attributed to the flu although the
patient did not seek medical attention at that time. Over the last
10 to 14 days prior to admission the patient noted increasing
exertional dyspnea , three episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
associated with right chest discomfort. There was no nausea ,
vomiting , diaphoresis , cyanosis. The patient also noted edema in
his lower extremities over the last two weeks. The last episode of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea was this past weekend. On the day of
admission the patient saw Dr. Mugrage once again and EKG
demonstrated marked anterolateral changes that were new since the
EKG taken on 7 of April .  The patient presented to the Lacon Hospital Emergency Ward. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant
for hypertension of approximately 10 years , non-insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus of approximately 12 years , left Bell's palsy in
1985 treated with prednisone , type IV hypolipoproteinemia. The
patient was also admitted for right face and arm pain at the
Skastem, Medical Center in 1 of October .  This was attributed to TIA. Carotid
non-invasives at that time along with a head CT were reportedly
negative. The patient also had a right cranial nerve III palsy in
30 of April .  MEDICATIONS: Micronase 10 mg po bid , Persantine 60 mg po
tid , aspirin one po q d , Lisinopril 5 mg po q d , and Atenolol 50 mg
po q d. ALLERGIES: None known. SOCIAL HISTORY: There is
approximately 20 pack year history of smoking. The patient quit
cigarettes 20 years ago. Ethanol history was social. The patient
is married , has two grown children. He currently works in a short
term storage warehouse office , apparently recently lost his tobacco
shop business and there is certainly a potential stress regarding
his employment situation and recent death of his sister-in-law
following a prolonged illness. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient reports
his parents are still living , has single sibling who is alive and
well. He denies family history of coronary artery disease ,
hypertension or diabetes. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Non-contributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a thin white male in no
acute distress sitting up on the stretcher.
Vital signs demonstrated he was afebrile , blood pressure 140/90 ,
pulse 88 , respirations 18. His room air O2 sat was 96%. HEENT
exam normocephalic , atraumatic. Left pupil was 5 mm and contracted
to 3; right pupil was 4 mm and contracted to 3. His extraocular
movements were intact. Fundi were poorly visualized secondary to
possible partial cataract. Oropharynx was only remarkable for
extensive upper bridge work. Neck was supple , no adenopathy. His
carotids were 1+ bilaterally without bruits. His chest exam was
remarkable for decreased breath sounds halfway up , right greater
than left , with absent breath sounds at the bases. The chest was
dull to percussion halfway up , however , there were no rales ,
wheezes or rhonchi noted. Cardiac exam revealed jugular venous
pulse was approximately 7 cm at 30 degrees , regular rate and
rhythm , S1 and S2 with loud S4 , otherwise no murmur or rub.
Abdominal exam demonstrated bowel sounds were present , non-tender ,
liver span 8 cm in midclavicular line. There was no spleen tip
palpable. Rectal exam normal tone with a firm prostate without
masses and stool was guaiac negative. Back exam revealed no spinal
or CVA tenderness noted. There was slight buffalo hump present ,
however. Extremities - Radial pulses 3+ , femoral 2+ , posterior
tibial 2+ on the right and 1+ on the left , dorsal pedis 1+
bilaterally. There are no femoral bruits. There was 1+ pitting
ankle edema bilaterally. Neuro exam was non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission sodium 141 , potassium 4.6 , chloride
105 , CO2 24 , BUN 19 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 178.
ALT 20 , AST 18 , LDH 177. CK 107. Alk phos 98 , bili total 0.5 ,
direct 0.2. Cholesterol 236 , triglycerides 320. Total protein
7.0 , globulin 4.6 , albumin 2.4 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 3.8. White
count 6.6 , Hct 39.8 , platelets 260 , 000 , three point differential
revealed 26% lymphocytes , 5.8% monocytes , 68.2% granulocytes. PT
was 12.6 , PTT 31.0. UA was pending. EKG showed normal sinus
rhythm at a rate of 84 , PR interval 160 , QRS 84 , QTC 0.44 , axis
+30. The EKG was remarkable for Q wave in T and F and extensively
across the precordium , T wave inversions in 1 , 2 , and R. ST
elevations of 2 to 3 mm in V2 , V3 , and V4 with T wave inversion in
V2 through V6 , all of these changes new since 1 of October .  Portable
chest x-ray demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with fluid in
the minor fissures , question of cardiomegaly , increasing pulmonary
vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medical
Service Ri Jotonmavilleceance Lisker and subsequently ruled out for MI
by enzymes. His initial CK was 107. Eight hours later his CK
drawn was 45 and final CK was 89. However , the patient underwent
echocardiography and the echocardiogram demonstrated a moderately
dilated left ventricle with decreased global contractile function ,
roughly estimated at around 25%. There were extensive wall motion
abnormalities with mid to distal septal akinesis , anterior ,
anterolateral , and septal apex dyskinesis consistent with a large
anterior myocardial infarction. However , there was no mural
thrombus seen although occult thrombi could not be excluded at that
time. Because of the echocardiogram result and the fact that the
patient ruled out for a recent MI the clinical picture was
consistent with an evolved myocardial infarction within the time
between the patient's initial presentation to Dr. Connelley in 7 of August
and the patient's presentation in 21 of January .  Consequently the plan was
made to manage the patient with gentle Lasix diuresis. The
patient's beta blocker was held because of the concern for wall
motion abnormalities and possible aneurysm formation. The patient
was anticoagulated on heparin and subsequently was loaded on
Coumadin. In addition the patient's afterload reduction was
increased and changed to Captopril. In addition the patient
underwent an exercise tolerance test with thallium scan on
26 of January .  During this procedure the patient exercised for 6
minutes on modified Bruce protocol. The test was stopped secondary
to leg fatigue. The patient's heart rate rose from 98 to 150 ,
blood pressure rose from 126/72 to 148/76. The patient had no
chest pain. There was no evidence for ischemia. Thallium images
showed a moderately severe perfusion defect at the apex sustained
to the low anterior wall , inferolateral wall , and septum. This
defect was unchanged on late images. There were , therefore , no
signs of ischemia , however , there was some mild transient loss of
uptake consistent with CHF. The overall impression was of a fixed
defect consistent with an evolved myocardial infarction. Because
of the evidence for an evolved myocardial infarction the decision
was made that this patient would not be a candidate for coronary
artery bypass grafting and so cardiac catheterization was deferred
at this time. The patient was discharged to home on 19 of April .  At
the time of discharge a UA and sediment were pending.
