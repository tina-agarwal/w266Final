Discharge Date: 3/19/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1. TYPE II DIABETES X15 YEARS.
2. HYPERTENSION.
3. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.
4. LEFT CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM.
6. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
7. SILENT INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN
1990.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67 year old female
with multiple medical problems ,
including coronary artery disease , status post stent to the left
circumflex in 1999 , silent MI in 1990 , hypertension , type II
diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia , who presented to an outside
hospital with acute onset of shortness of breath that occurred
while the patient was watching T.V. This dyspnea was associated
with chest heaviness , but the patient denies nausea , diaphoresis ,
or radiation. The patient reports similar symptoms when she
presented in 4/10 to an outside hospitalization and was ultimately
stented for a left circumflex lesion. On the day of admit , the
patient was seen at the Odaughters Nyco Centspan Hospital , where she was
apparently in respiratory distress , and treated with oxygen ,
nitroglycerin , aspirin , Lasix , CPAP , and morphine. Chest x-ray , by
report , showed CHF. The patient improved with diuresis and was
admitted on a R/O protocol for flash pulmonary edema. Her
troponin-I and initial two CKs were flat. She was then transferred
here for cardiac cath , as cardiac ischemia was the suspected
culprit for her presentation. The patient states she sleeps with
one pillow. She has no PND or palpitations. She further denies
fevers , chills , constipation , nausea , vomiting , cough , bright red
blood per rectum , melena , or dysuria. The patient denies diet or
medicine indiscretion. The patient has had no further chest pain
or shortness of breath since the day she was admitted to the
outside hospital.

infarction in her 90s.

metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Levoxyl
0.1 mg p.o. q.d.; Zocor 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 20 mg x1 p.o. q.d.

years. She has a 60 pack year history of tobacco
use. ( Three packs per day x20 years ). The patient reports rare
alcohol use and denies any drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temp 98.6 , heart rate 74 , BP
122/79 , respiratory rate 20 , satting 94% on
room air. GENERAL: The patient is alert and oriented x3 , pleasant
female sitting in the bed in no apparent distress. HEENT: PERRL.
The patient has dentures. No lesions in her pharynx. NECK: JVD
approximately 7 cm. HEART: II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard
best at the base. No S3 , S4. LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles.
ABDOMEN: Obese , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender ,
non-distended. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. Her
feet skin is intact. She has bilateral bruits in her groins. She
has a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse on the right. No dorsalis pedis
pulse was appreciated on the left. NEURO: Non-focal.
LABORATORY DATA: Na 136 , K 4.3 , Cl 100 , bicarb 25 , BUN 36 ,
creatinine 1.5 , glucose 162. ALT 6 , AST 10 , CK
45 , alk phos 40 , T. bili 0.3 , D. bili 0.1 , albumin 3.6 , mag 1.7 ,
troponin-I 0.05. White count 8.4 , hematocrit 31.3 , platelets 298 ,
MCV 88 , RDW 13. PT 11.6 , INR 0.9 , PTT 25.1. Urinalysis showed 1+
protein , 3+ blood , 2+ leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 35-40
white cells , 80-85 red cells , 1+ bacteria , 1+ epi , no casts. EKG ,
on admission , showed a normal sinus rhythm at 70 , LVH with probable
strain laterally. No significant changes from an EKG done on
5/26/99 .  Of note , an EKG done at the outside hospital on 1/28
showed inverted Ts in I , L , and V2-V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to this hospital with a
recent episode of flash pulmonary edema. When
this had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealed
an occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. There were ,
therefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion either
of the stent or of one of her other vessels. Her metformin was
held. She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then she
underwent cardiac catheterization. The results of this study were
as follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% mid
D1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her prior
catheterization. The patient left circumflex stent was widely
patent. The patient's RCA was noted to be occluded and was filling
with collaterals from left to right. At the time of the
catheterization , the patient's renal arteries are also evaluated.
There was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis.
However , no other renal disease was noted.
Because the patient's catheterization was unchanged from a prior
study , it was unclear as to the significance of her D1 lesion. For
this reason , the patient underwent an ETT MIBI , the results of
which are as follows: The patient underwent a modified Bruce ,
heart rate of 66% of maximum predicted heart rate. She exercised
for 4 minutes 30 seconds and stopped secondary to dyspnea. She had
no new EKG changes and no chest pain. The MIBI portion of the test
showed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarct
ischemia involving 3-5 segments. At the time of this dictation , it
is felt that the patient's CAD is an unlikely explanation for her
presentation. Dr. Dibernardo will review the MIBI results and decide
whether a repeat catheterization with PCI is warranted. The most
likely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunction
given her age and history of diabetes. Dr. Hake is interested in
enrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptor
blockers in treatment of this disorder.
The patient had an echo during this hospitalization. The left
ventricle is mildly dilated with an EF of 50%. The patient has
apical , septal , and lateral hypokinesis. Her right ventricle size
and function is normal. The patient also has a dilated left atrium
with mild mitral regurgitation.
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with her primary care
physician in two weeks and her primary
cardiologist in four weeks.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home.
Please note that an addendum to this discharge summary will be
added with the patient's discharge medications.
