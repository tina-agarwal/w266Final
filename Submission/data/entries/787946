elevated white blood cell count.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kubler is a 77-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems including history of
cerebrovascular accident with resultant expressive aphasia ,
seizures after this cerebrovascular accident , chronically
ventilator dependent , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis as
a complication likely of gentamicin in August 2006 , history of
peripheral arterial disease with multiple toe amputations and
atrial fibrillation who was recently admitted at Ahooldi Health for an increasing BUN and creatinine ,
who was transferred from Ark Hospital Medical Center after she
developed an ulcer on her right lower extremity. At baseline ,
the patient is bed bound , but is alert , able to smile and
communicates by mouthing words occasionally. She developed a
right calf hematoma several weeks prior to this admission that
was incised and drained by the Surgical Service about one to two
weeks prior to admission. Since then she has had daily dressing
changes at her rehabilitation and at first her skin was noted to
be intact. On 5/5/06 , the patient had an increased temperature
to 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit and then four days prior to
admission , she was noted to have a white blood cell count of
22 , 000. She was placed on empiric vancomycin , levofloxacin and
metronidazole on 5/5/06 for possible treatment of
ventilator-assisted pneumonia and she had remained
hemodynamically stable. There was no note of increased
secretions or other problems with ventilation. On the day of
admission , the patient was on hemodialysis and a blister erupted
over her right calf wound , which revealed an underlying deep
ulcer down to the muscle. At that point , the patient's son
