Discharge Date: 10/29/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Delgrosso is a 68 year old female
with known heart murmur since the
1950s. She has a been closely followed since approximately 1990
for multi-valve disease. In early February of 1998 she presented
with chest pressure and was seen at Ga Medical Center for
cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronary
artery disease but markedly increased filling pressures. Her right
atrial pressure was 14/16/10. Right ventricular pressure was
75/100 , pulmonary artery pressure was 75/35/50 and her pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 32/36/30. Echocardiogram on 2/11/98 ,
revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mildly decreased
systolic function with an ejection fraction of 45 percent , normal
right ventricular size and function , moderate mitral stenosis and
three plus mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency and
aortic stenosis , three plus tricuspid regurgitation and a dilated
inferior vena cava.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for rheumatic fever ,
hypothyroidism , borderline diabetes
mellitus , atrial fibrillation , breast cancer for which she had
radiation therapy.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a right lumpectomy in the
1990s. She has had an appendectomy in 1993
and a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in the past.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin ( causes rash and itch ).
PHYSICAL EXAM: Unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Copes was brought to the operating room on
0/9/98 where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement with a #19 St. Jude valve , a mitral valve replacement
with a #27 St. Jude valve and a tricuspid valvuloplasty with a
DeVega annuloplasty. The patient intraoperatively was found to
have a tricuspid valve with a dilated annulus but normal leaflets.
Transient right ventricular dysfunction requiring epinephrine and
nitroglycerin. The patient came off of bypass and was paced. The
patient went back into atrial fibrillation. The patient was
brought up to the intensive care unit in stable condition. Ms.
Kelty was extubated on postoperative day number one. She was noted
to have bradycardia postoperatively which required pacing and she
was found to have no significant underlying rhythm. She was seen
by the electrophysiology service who had suggested we continue
following her and hope to find a recurrence of her AV node
function. She was discharged to the step-down unit on
postoperative day number two. She was found to have an intrinsic
rhythm of atrial fibrillation with a left bundle branch block with
a heart rhythm of 55-65. Ms. Old continued in atrial
fibrillation with a rate in the 80s and was able to come off of her
external pacemaker. The patient was started on Dextran to augment
anticoagulation which increased her INR for discharge planning.
She will be discharged to home in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Coumadin as directed; Captopril 25 mg
q 8h , Digoxin 01.25 mg q day , Colace 100
mg three times a day: Levoxil 50 mcg once a day , Lasix 80 mg once a
day , potassium chloride 40 mg once a day.
LABORATORY DATA AT DISCHARGE: On 2/3/98 , her glucose was 112 ,
BUN 10 , creatinine 0.9 , sodium 133 ,
potassium 4.2 , chloride 99 , C02 of 25 , magnesium of 2.4 , digoxin
level was 0.6. White blood cells 10.6 , hemoglobin 11.4 , hematocrit
35.1 , platelets 319 , PT 18.3 , INR of 2.3.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE: Ms. Cheeks will be discharged to home in
stable condition with visiting nurse.
She will follow up with her cardiologist in the next 1-2 weeks and
Dr. Gerringer in the next six weeks.
