COMPLICATIONS:
There were no complications.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was transferred to the unit in stable fashion with
lines and tubes intact. On postoperative day #1 , 9/29/05 , the
patient was pressor-dependent , slow to extubate. On
postoperative day #2 , 7/23/05 , atrial fibrillation , Lopressor
increased to 25 mg q.i.d. , became subsequently hypotensive. On
4/7/05 , postoperative day #3 was given 1 unit of packed red
blood cells for hematocrit of 24 , transferred to the Step-Down
Unit on postoperative day #3.
SUMMARY BY SYSTEMS:
1. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3 , appropriate , follows
commands , given Toradol and oxycodone , Tylenol for pain.
2. Cardiovascular: Started on Lopressor. Preoperative EF of
65% , mean arterial pressure 65 , normal sinus rhythm , rate of 66 ,
bradycardic overnight , but stable morning transfer , Lopressor 25
mg q.i.d. , atrial and ventricular wires in place. The plan is to
discontinue in the next few days.
3. Respiratory: Stable on 2 liters of oxygen delivered via
nasal cannula. Chest tubes discontinued postoperative day #2.
Chest x-ray was pending.
4. GI: Tolerating p.o. without difficulty , given Nexium and
Simvastatin.
5. Renal: Continue diuresis with Lasix 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
started on insulin sliding scale for blood glucose , received 1
unit packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 24 with
post-hematocrit of 28.3 , started on aspirin , given prophylactic
antibiotics with chest tubes , transferred to the Step-Down Unit
on postoperative day #4 , 4/26/05 doing well. Plan to get PA and
lateral chest x-ray may need rehab , will screen when rate
controlled atrial fibrillation for one hour , now in normal sinus
rhythm. On 11/4/05 , wires discontinued flipping back and forth
for normal sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation , diuresing well.
We will try and get in normal sinus rhythm for 24 hours before
sending home. On 2/17/05 in normal sinus rhythm all day.
Planned to send home in the morning 7/6/05 to go to home , went

Coumadin. On 11/28/05 kept one more day for his atrial
fibrillation , seems to be better rate controlled in 90s , started
on Coumadin , has been having low-grade temps but appears to be

patient was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery Service to be stable to
