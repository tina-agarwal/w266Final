hospitalization , please see the dictation by the Vascular Surgery
team. The patient was transferred to the Medical Service for
further management on 2/7/07. Briefly , this is a 59-year-old
female with diabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis ,
history of recurrent MRSA infections including vertebral osteo
status post compression fracture and fusion admitted to Therm Clinic on 2/23/07 from rehab after rupture of her
right forearm AV fistula. The patient underwent surgical
ligation of her brachial artery. The patient had a significant
drop in her hematocrit to 14 , and she received several units of
packed red blood cells and underwent surgical ligation of the
brachial artery. She subsequently remained intubated on Levophed
in the Surgical ICU. She was then weaned off Levophed and
transferred to the Surgery Service. The patient completed a
course of linezolid for treatment of her recent bacteremia , which
ended on 4/27/07. She was started on fluconazole 400 mg once
daily for treatment of recent candidemia , course ending 11/6/07 ,
and she was also started on vancomycin 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
ongoing suppressive treatment of recurrent C. diff. The
patient's hospital course was subsequently complicated by severe
deconditioning , refeeding syndrome , poor nutritional status and
decubitus ulcers.

3/21
2. Type I diabetes with neuropathy , nephropathy , retinopathy and
gastroparesis.

compression status post fusion in 9/10
10. History of C. diff colitis recurrent and unresponsive to
metronidazole.

upper extremity with absent radial pulses and atrophy and
contracture. Ulnar pulse was positive. Right upper extremity
was cooler than left. Left upper extremity with radial and ulnar
pulses present. Skin significant for sacral decubitus ulcers
stage II and III with pink granulation tissue , no evidence of
purulent discharge. Neuro exam , alert and oriented x1.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for a potassium of 3.4 , BUN and
creatinine 23 and 2.5 , calcium 7.7 , phos 2.8 , mag 1.6. White
blood cell count 13.3 , hematocrit 27.5 , platelets 137 , 000.
Albumin 2.1.
HOSPITAL COURSE: A 59-year-old female with diabetes , end-stage
renal disease on hemodialysis , history of recurrent infections
including MRSA vertebral osteo , bacteremia in 6/11 and
gram-negative rod sepsis in 9/13 with T5-6 osteo and cord
compression status post fusion in 9/13 admitted on 2/23/07 for
AV fistula rupture and bleed now status post brachial artery
ligation.
Hospital course complicated by severe deconditioning , poor
nutritional status and decubitus ulcers.
1. Infectious disease: The patient started to become afebrile
48 hours after transfer to the Medical Service with temperatures
as high as 102.5. Vital signs were stable. Blood cultures are
still no growth to date. Chest x-ray without any evidence of
infiltrate. The patient is anuric , likely source decubitus
ulcers versus recurrent osteo. Blood cultures were obtained on a
daily basis , which were no growth today at the time of this
dictation. Fluconazole and vancomycin p.o. were continued ,
course ending on 2/13/07. The ID. Service was asked to consult
for further help with management of the patient's fevers.
Plastics consult was obtained to evaluate decubitus ulcers.
.
2. Renal: The patient was followed by Renal Service and had
dialysis on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays.
3. GI: The patient was maintained on Reglan for gastroparesis
and continued on Nexium.
4. Heme: The patient had guaiac-positive stools. Her
hematocrit was 28 and dropped to 25.8 upon transfer. She
received two units of packed red blood cells transfusion on
6/14/07 during dialysis.
5. Endocrine: The patient had uncontrolled hyperglycemia likely
secondary to the stress of her hospitalization. She was
initially on 40 units of NPH b.i.d. and this was titrated up to
maintain normal glycemia.
6. Derm: She had decubitus ulcers followed by the wound care
nurse , Vicente Desai She was continued on Panafil and XenoDerm.
A Plastics consult was obtained regarding need for further
debridement.
7. FEN: The patient's course was complicated by refeeding
syndrome with severe electrolyte imbalances requiring aggressive
repletion of her electrolytes including phos , K and mag. She was
maintained on tube feeds. A Speech and Swallow evaluation was
obtained , which determined that she can be started on pureed
diet. However , it was unlikely that she would be able to
maintain adequate p.o. intake.
8. Prophylaxis The patient was maintained on heparin prophylaxis
for DVT and Nexium given her guaiac-positive stools.
At time of this dictation , the plan is for a family meeting to
