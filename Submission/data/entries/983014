gentleman who has a history of asthma
and hypertension. No known history of coronary artery disease.
The patient presented with acute onset of wheezing on the morning
of admission. He was in his usual state of health until he
developed this shortness of breath while driving which he is
believed is secondary to an asthma flare. He received Albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizers in the emergency room , as well as IV
Solu-Medrol for oxygen saturation in the 80s , with some
improvement. He was also noted to have an elevated triponin level
at 0.12. The CK was 241 with MB of 0. Subsequent CK was 393 with
MB of 50.1. He was transferred to the cardiology service for rule
out myocardial infarction and for further evaluation and treatment.
At that time he denied any chest pain or radiation of pain.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Remarkable for tobacco use of one to two cigars a
day. Ethanol use.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension. Asthma. Nephrotic
proteinuria. Insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus. Elevated cholesterol.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post thoracotomy in 1986 for
retrocardiac/atrial cystic mass. Status
post vasectomy.
ALLERGIES: Penicillin.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin NPH 33 units
subcu q.a.m. and 15 units subcu q.p.m. , Lisinopril 20
mg q.d. , Losartan 100 mg q.d. , Zocor 20 mg q.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o.

crackles , as well as wheezes , throughout. Heart: Regular rate and
rhythm. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops. Abdomen: Large , obese.
Tympanitic. Good bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits. Serum
glucose 269. CBC: WBC 12 , hematocrit 49 ,
platelet count 261.
HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction and he , indeed , was found to rule in
for a myocardial infarction with triponin of 7.77. He had an
echocardiogram which revealed inferior septal hypokinesis , left
ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 40%. He had normal
PA systolic pressures. He underwent cardiac catheterization on
4/15/98 which revealed stenosis of the left anterior descending
artery of 90% and left circumflex artery of 90% and right coronary
artery total occlusion. It also showed ejection fraction of 25%.
Based on these catheterization results and his ruling in for
myocardial infarction , he was taken to the operating room on
4/7/98 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft.
The left internal mammary artery was grafted to the left anterior
descending artery. The saphenous vein graft and radial artery were
used to graft the aorta to the obtuse marginal and to the posterior
descending artery. At the time of the procedure there was drainage
of a bronchogenic cyst which was identified by echocardiogram. The
contents of the cyst were found to be sterile. During the
procedure he had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed.
Postoperatively he had some bleeding from his chest tubes. The
chest was left open postoperatively and covered with Esmarch
bandage. Several hours postoperatively he had some bleeding and
required re-exploration of the chest. We removed a small amount of
bleeding from the cavity. One pack was left in.
He remained on several inatropes and pressors and remained on an
intra-aortic balloon pump. He was transfused with multiple blood
products , including platelets and fresh frozen plasma for continued
leaking. He remained intubated and was gradually weaned off of
pressors. He also remained on a Lasix drip for diuresis and he
continued to receive multiple units of blood products.
On 8/5/98 he underwent sternal closure in the operating room. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. He was again taken to
Intensive Care Unit. He remained intubated and on an intra-aortic
balloon pump. On 1/22/98 the patient had been extubated and
intra-aortic balloon pump had been removed. Gradually his cardiac
drips were weaned. Postoperatively he had atrial fibrillation and
he was begun on Coumadin. He had an atrial arrhythmia which was
controlled medically. He continued to progress slowly and was
begun on oral medications as his drips were weaned.
The patient was noted to have a 3 cm upper sternal opening which
was initially thought to be possibly infected and this was opened
as concern for his diabetes mellitus and possible infection.
Plastic surgery was consulted and there was no gross infection to
be found. He had gram stain and culture obtained of the wound.
The gram stain revealed sterile wound and culture had grown out
nothing. The plastic surgery recommended two week course of IV
Vancomycin to cover possible organisms; however , there was no
clinical evidence of infection. The patient had a PICC line placed
for long term antibiotics and he is being discharged on Vancomycin
IV at a dose of 1 mg IV q18h with peak and trough to be checked at
rehabilitation facility. He will also continue with wet to dry
dressing changes on the sternal wound t.i.d.
