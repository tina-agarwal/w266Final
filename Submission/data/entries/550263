A/P: 8 Y/O M w/ mult med problems , s/p recent AVR , transferred from
rehab w/ fever , +U/A , +blood cx's , with concern for
endocarditis given recent AVR. Patient was started on ceftaz and vanco
empirically , then was changed to ceftriaxone and gentamycin once Gemella
morbillorum was identified on in-house blood cultures. Patient remained
afebrile in-house and did not exhibit any significant leukocytosis , or
stigmata of endocardititis. Surveillance cultures drawn after starting
antibiotics have remained negative to date.
--------
1. Cardiovascular ischemia: No CP/CT/CD. Hx of CAD s/p CABG continue
w/ aspirin 325mg PO QD rhythm: pt w hx of AF w/ SVR. Patient placed
on telemetry for observation. Is bradycardic at
baseline , asymptomatic has refused PPM in the past per report. Some runs
NSVT up to 14 beats , checking BID lytes keep Mg&gt;2 and K.4 , no nodal
agents given bradycardia. Pump: hx CHF documented , last EF 60%. pt
appears fluid up , responded well to 60 IV lasix x1. Pt then appeared
euvolemic and lasix was held , for sev days and became hypervolemic ,
lasix 60mg IV repeated and patient restarted on home lasix dose ( 80mg
QAM ). Patient's discharge weight is 96.7kg. His dry weight is
approximately 93KG. Discharge weight is 96.7kg. His in/out goal is 500cc
neg daily. -TTE neg for veg , but given high risk , TEE obtained on 1/21
to assess for possible endocarditis. Was negative for ring abscess or
valvular vegetationn. Pt will still require treatement for
endocarditis as cannot be entirely ruled out. Held losartan
due to acute worsening of renal function as well as initiation of
gentamycin. Pt can resume use once gent is discontinued.
2. Renal: Cr slightly elevated above
baseline ( 1.1-1.3 ) on admit , likely 2/2 CHF and poor forward flow has
declined to near baseline and was 1.4 at time of d/c.
3. GU: Pt has hx of BPH and has a suprapubic cathether that was inserted
at the time of surgery due to difficulty to pass foley. At BRMC pt has
been clamped repeatedly over the last week w/ PVR checked. Pt
without difficulty in house w/ PVR of 50cc. Urology consulted and
suprapubic catheter pulled without difficulty. Cont dry sterile dressing
daily to wound.
3. ID-Gemella morbillorum in blood , Pseudomonas in urine although
only 10k colonies. Pt treated with 5 days of ceftaz , and 4 days
vanc. Decision was made to d/c ceftaz given only 10K colonies
Pseudomonas in urine and some coverage with ceftriaxone and gent ( started
5/25 ) d/c'd vanc 4/13 Will need 6 wks ctx and at least 2 wks gent for
presumed endocarditis. PICC placed 5/25
4. GI -continue protonix 40 Q12 all stools guaiac negative in house.
5. Endocrine -hx of IDDM will titrate up insulin to 36U qHS
w/ insluin aspart SS
6. FEN -cardiac diet -cont MVI -BID lytes w/ goal to keep K/Mg January
7. GI -continue senna and colace
8. Pulm -cont flovent 2 puffs BID and albuterol q12h
9. Heme: cont niferex BID for iron deficiency anemia.Pt also with mild
eosinophilia on diff , should be monitored.
10. Derm: skin tear on right hand , placing neomycin ointment and sterile
dry dressing daily.
