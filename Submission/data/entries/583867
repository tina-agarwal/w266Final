CONSULTS: ---------
CC: exertional SOB
HPI: 77yoM w/ hx CAD s/p CABG 2003 , p/w 2 weeks of increasing exertional
dyspnea. At baseline can walk 4-5 blocks , over last couple weeks can
only walk about 1 block before becoming SOB. Was also getting SOB w/
minimal activity at home including showering. Sleeps on one pillow , no
orthopnea , no PND. Has had some pedal edema over the few weeks.
Increased urination and increased thirst , no reported change in diet.
Recently stopped HCTZ but no other change in meds. Also w/ some dull
chest pain over left side that radiates in a band like fashion across his
stenum to back , 3-4/10 in intensity , not brought on by activity , lasts
for seconds at a time when present , pleuritic. Reproducible w/
palpation. Pt had fallen on his right side several weeks earlier. Some
dull abdominal discomfort in lower quadrants usually improved with bowel
movements , last BM yesterday. No n/v. No calf tenderness , no recent
surgery , no recent travel. January wt 158lbs by records , pt has not
noticed any weight gain.
Pt reports not having this pain previously , however by records pt was
evaluated in 10/29/05 for similar atypical chest pains that was
ultimately a neg workup , with ECHO 3/24 w/ diastolic dysfn EF 60-65% , no
WMA , mod MR , mod TR , stress test 0/4 w/ no changes c/w ischemia on EKG
or ECHO ( but non-diagnositic due to peak HR 64 BP 140/66 ). He was seen
by Dr Decuir at that time who felt that ACS/ischemia was unlikely , and
that symptoms may have been 2/2 CHF and MR ( and his ECHO also showed new
AI at that time ) , and pt was apparently started on ACE at that time for
afterload reduction. He is not on an ACE right now and it is unclear
why. Further w/u of ischemia was suggested if the pt had persistent
symptoms but the symptoms seemed to have resolved by these notes.
In ED 97.8 55 176/64 18 98%RA. BNP 1196 , trop-I 0.10. d-dimer 272. Got
ASA . EKG sinus brady no ST/TW changes. D-dimer 272. CXR no obvious
acute cardiopulmonary changes.

IMPRESSION: 77yoM w/ hx htn , DM , CAD s/p CABG 2003 , ESRD s/p transplant
11/17 , p/w 2 weeks of increasing exertional SOB , pedal edema , and left
sided reproducible chest pain occ radiating across right side of chest to
back , pleuritic , exam notable for elevated JVP but no crackles , CXR not
obvious for congestion , labs notable for BNP 1196 , trop 0.1 , Ddimer neg.
Suspect CHF as cause of increasing SOB. Suspicion for ACS low given
previous neg w/u w/ similar atypical chest pain presentation , at that
time also thought to be 2/2 CHF.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
--CV: I: h/o CAD s/p CABG , but suspicion for ischemia low. Ruled out by
enzymes and EKG x 3. Suspect elevated troponin 2/2 demand ischemia from
CHF. On ASA , BB. Not on statin , but lipid panel in 8/15 w/ LDL 87 and
total chol 166. Started on low dose ACE lisinopril 5mg. MIBI no
reversible changes. P: CHF , goal dry weight 158 lbs , admission weight 164
lbs. On Lasix 60mg daily at home. Diuresed , responded well to IV Lasix
60mg , w/ improvement in SOB and clinical exam , dc weight 160.5lbs. Will
send out on 60mg BID x 1 week and then back to 60mg daily. Concern that
worsening MR may be constributing to CHF and possibly flash in setting of
htn , but ECHO showed mid/mod MR not changed from 3/24 .  Also w/ trace
AI , mild/mod TR , diastolic dysfunction w/ restrictive defect , EF 65% , no
WMA , PAP 58+RAP ( which has preogressive increased from previous ECHO
reports , was 41 in 3/24 ) , likely cor pulmonale from left sided heart
failure. MIBI did not show any reversible ishcemia. Was on labetalol
and norvasc for htn and BPs suboptimal in 160s -180s , previously on
captopril 37.5 TID but stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. started on low
dose lisinopril 5mg daily for afterload reduction especially in setting
of MR , will need to f/u K closely. Pt tolerated 2 doses captopril ( 25
and 37.5 ) without hyperkalemia in hospital but on higher doses of lasix.
Imdur 30mg daily also added. Pt also on clonidine. R: on tele , sinus
brady , asymptomatic , no other events.
--RESP: satting fine on room air with resolution of SOB after diuresis.
--GI: constipation , cont colace and senna. On pepcid given on
prednisone.
--RENAL: ESRD s/p transplant 0/30 .  cont tacrolimus , cellcept ,
prednisone. Tacrolimus levels nl. Followed by renal transplant team
who agreed w/ management of BPs above.
--HEME: anemia , Hct stable.
--ENDO: diabetes. Continued initially on home nph regimen w/ novolog
sliding scale. Pt became hypoglycemic overnight both nights to the 40s
and to less than 20s ( the latter in the setting of not eating dinner ) ,
both around 3-4am. Pt says that in the morning he is sometimes low and
sometimes high in 100s. Suspect this may be happening chronically w/
possible rebound hyperglycemia in AM Will be sent home on decreased NPH
regimen at night 8U , resume AM dose 24U.
--FEN: 2L fluid restriction , low sodium/chol/fat/diabetic diet
--PPx: heparin , pepcid
FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: We have changed the following medications: 1 NPH 24U in the morning and
8U in the evening , as your overnight sugars have been low 2. Take Lasix
60mg twice a day for one week and then go back to one time a day on 2/15
3. lisinopril and imdur have been added to help control your blood
pressure.
Please drink only 2L fluids daily and keep daily weights. Your weight
goal is 158 lbs , if your weight is over this or increases by more than
2-3 lbs , call Dr. Ruths .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
VNA: 1. monitor BP 2. monitor weights and CHF symptoms-dry weight 158lbs
3. fingersticks
MD: 1. monitor BP and K--started on lisinopril and imdur 2. goal dry
weight 158lbs 3. titrate insulin regimen--night nph decreased 2/2
persistent hypoglycemia o/n
