BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
*CC: Chest , shoulder pain
*HPI: 43y diabetic man with 3vD , discharged from MCH on 9/4 after
3vCABG , initially manifested as chest tightness and L shoulder pain.
CABG was notable for complex anatomy ( LIMA-LAD , LRad-Ao-OM1 ,
LVB/SVG-PDA ) with small-caliber grafts and a postop course complicated by
MI and pneumonia. Mr. Meisch currently presents with 12 hours continuous
6/10 chest pressure at rest , also sharp L shoulder pain. In the ED , his
pain was relieved by NTG/narcotic. His EKG and cardiac enzymes suggested
against an acute coronary syndrome. He was admitted with suspicion of
pericarditis / pericardial effusion based on history and exam.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable in - house but noted to be
hypervolemic with JVP 12cm , clear lungs , and s4 gallop without rub on
cardiac exam , and displaying mild peripheral edema. A sestamibi -
adenosine stress study displayed a small inferobasal area of reversible
perfusion defect without wall motion abnormality. A cardiac
echocardiogram showed a mildly dilated left ventricle with inferior
hypokinesis , an EF of 70% and free of effusion. These tests were
unchanged or improved verses similar tests performed during his prior
admission.
Mr. Constantino was diuresed with 20mg Lasix IV x1 followed by 20mg Lasix PO
x1 to which he responded well. At the time of discharge , his chest pain
had complety resolved and he was nearly euvolemic. Also on this
admission , he was noted to develop a bad taste in his mouth as a result of
captopril use. He was then switched to lisinopril with resolution of
symptoms.
Of note during this admission , Mr. Parone agreed to see a consultant from
the WC department of Psychiatry for numerous issues within his personal
life which have been causing him distress. Formal recommendations from
psychiatry after extended conversions with Mr. Knapick include a referral
to Family Services at Pin Chiblan Hospital Center for couple's
therapy for him and his wife as well as referral to VGMC outpatient
psychiatry for individual and possibly pharmacologic therapy.
