ATTENDING: JOSEF CROTTEAU M.D.
The patient was admitted Watylake Hospital Cardiology
Service and Coronary Care Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Myocardial infarction.
2. Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Diabetes type 2.
3. Peripheral vascular disease.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Depression.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ).
8. History of GI bleed.
9. Obstructive sleep apnea.
10. Status post cholecystectomy.
11. Status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valve

12. History of transfusion reaction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old male
with coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass
graft in 1982 , also status post Bjork-Shiley aortic valve
replacement for bicuspid aortic valve , status post redo CABG in
1995 with SVG to OM2 and SVG to LAD , who presented to Nalcon Memorial Hospital after developing chest pain unrefractory to
nitroglycerin. En route to the ER , he suffered a ventricular
fibrillation arrest , was defibrillated x1 with 120 Joules to a
rhythm of pulseless electrical activity. He then received fluids
and lidocaine bolus and he recovered his pulse and blood pressure
and was intubated in the field.
Of note , the patient had an AVR Bjork-Shiley and saphenous vein
graft to LAD and left circumflex sequential grafting , original
surgery in 1982. In 1985 , he underwent reoperation with
saphenous vein graft to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM2. He
has had multiple admissions to Estatewentlung Lufirm Community Medical Center in the past
year. In July 2003 , he was admitted with chest pain. He ruled in
for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was taken to the
catheterization lab. At the cath lab in July 2003 , at Dotonh/ Medical Center he had a left main with a tight ostial lesion.
He had saphenous vein graft to LAD , it was patent , saphenous vein
graft to OM2 was patent with a tight 95% stenosis proximally in
OM2 at the touchdown site inhibiting retrograde profusion. It
was determined at this point that PCI would be inappropriate. At
that time and echo showed an EF of 25% with moderate mitral
regurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressures of 47. He
was medically managed on nitrates , an ACE inhibitor ,
beta-blocker , digoxin , and Lasix. Per his wife , he had been
doing well since May of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens on
occasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch with
his son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , but
this time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. He
called EMS who arrived at the scene and he had the following code
status mentioned above with a VF arrest and then a PEA arrest.
On arrival to Tonwa Medical Center he had a heart rate of 132 , blood
pressure 89/61 , and respiratory rate 28. He was given normal
saline 2 liters , dopamine drip , Lopressor 5 mg IV push , and he
was paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patient
would likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspected
myocardial infarction. He was transferred the Specce Health Care Cardiac Cath lab emergently.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Coronary artery disease , status post CABG as noted above; history
of multiple non-Q-wave MIs in 1985 and subsequently history of
diabetes type 2 , peripheral vascular disease , depression , chronic
renal insufficiency , hypercholesterolemia , COPD , history of GI
bleed , peptic ulcer disease , obstructive sleep apnea , atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response , status post
cholecystectomy , status post aortobifem bypass graft in 1987 ,
history of transfusion reaction resulting in hemolysis.
ALLERGIES: He has no known medical allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Included insulin , Isordil , digoxin ,
aspirin , folate , Lasix , Lipitor , lisinopril , metoprolol ,
Protonix , and Coumadin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a current smoker. He is a retired truck
driver and he is married.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and
diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On presentation to Thara Healthcare , he had a pulse of 70 , blood pressure 87/54. He was
intubated and had a saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. He was
intubated and sedated. His JVP was 12 cm of water. He had a
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2. No murmurs , rubs ,
or gallops. He had a mechanical S2. His abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bilateral lower extremities were
cool and clammy with 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally. He had
ecchymosis as a result of his Coumadin use.
Initial labs were significant for a glucose of 220 , a CK of 565
with an MB of 74 and troponin of 14.0. Hematocrit was 48. His
INR was 1.7. Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.
EKG with sinus rhythm and a left bundle-branch block with right
axis deviation. Also with inferior T-wave inversions and 1-mm ST
elevation in V3 and 1-mm ST depressions in I and O.
Echocardiogram previously on 6/28 revealed an EF of 39% with
inferior HK and AK , lateral HK , inferoapical DK. He had mild MR
and aortic radiant of 27/16. The right ventricular systolic
function is normal.
In summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chronic
coronary artery disease , now status post a VF arrest in the
setting of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated ST
elevation in V3. He was admitted for critical care to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Lungken Medical Center . 
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia: The patient was transferred
emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where
catheterization revealed severe native 3VD and vein graft
disease. His left main is moderately sized with a distal 60%
lesion. The mid LAD was proximally occluded after the first
septa. His left circumference is proximally occluded. The
distal LAD after vein graft is without significant disease and
the distal OM branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseased
with focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. Saphenous
vein graft to LAD is patent , saphenous vein graft to OM has 99%
lesion in distal anastomosis with _____ flow and a tilting disk
aortic valve that appears to be functioning normally. In
summary , the patient had what was considered to be a
nonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admitted
for medical management. He received optimal medical management
for his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and Plavix ,
statin , beta-blocker , ACE inhibitor as tolerated. His ischemic
EKG changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of the
Coronary Care Unit and he has been chest pain-free for the
remainder of that day. His CK peaked at 1090 on 5/14/03 . Pump:
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin for a goal PTT of
6084 for his Bjork-Shiley valve. His Coumadin was held in the
setting. He had a TTE on 5/14/03 , which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with inferoposterior HK ,
left atrial enlargement , mild to moderate MR , and well-seated
AVR. The patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine during his ICU stay and he was transferred out to
the floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. Rhythm: As
noted above , the patient admitted with status post VF arrest. He
was successfully defibrillated out of that with shock x 1.
However , his course was complicated by an episode of atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160s
associated with hypotension for which he was electively
cardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which he
was loaded with a 10-g amio load , and he has remained in normal
sinus rhythm since that episode. However , after the patient had
been transferred to the floor and was stable , he received a
single lead AICD given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy ,
coronary artery disease , and status post VF arrest.
Pulmonary: The patient was initially intubated in the CCU for
airway protection. He was rapidly weaned on the sedation. He
was successfully extubated on 8/3/03 . However , his chest x-ray
was complicated by left lower lobe infiltrate , which was
concerning for pneumonia. He ultimately has sputum culture that
grew out pseudomonas and he has been treated with a 14-day course
for pseudomonal pneumonia. Please see ID section below for more
details.
Infectious Disease: The patient with hypotension and question of
sepsis , septic physiology on 8/3/03 . He was started on empiric
levofloxacin and Flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia by
chest x-ray. He was also given one dose of gentamicin and then
covered his broad into ceftaz , vanc , levo , and Flagyl while
awaiting results. He ultimately had no growth from any blood
cultures , although did have on sputum culture positive for
pseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant to
levofloxacin. He was ultimately switched over to single agent
ceftazidime for a total of 14-day course for pseudomonal
pneumonia/bronchitis.
Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.6 and 2.0. In the Intensive Care Unit ,
he had a rise of his creatinine up to a peak of 2.8. At the time
of discharge , he still has slightly elevated creatinine at 2.2 ,
although it seems to be normalizing. It is likely that this is
contributed by his Dilaudid received at the time of
catheterization.
Heme: The patient anticoagulated at home with Coumadin and then
during his hospitalization with unfractionated heparin for his
Bjork-Shiley valve with a goal PTT of 60 to 80. At the time of
discharge , he is being recoumadinized with a goal INR of 2.5 to
3.5. Previously , his home dose of Coumadin had been 2 mg p.o.
q.d. He will need to have his heparin dripped to 10 units
therapeutically with PTT 60 to 80 until his INR is therapeutic on
Coumadin. Hematology continued the patient also with a
macrocytic anemia , currently on folate therapy. At the time of
discharge , his labs were pending for a B12 level , methylmalonic
acid , and homocysteine did need to be followed up while the
patient is at rehab.
Endocrine: The patient with diabetes. He was continued on NPH
with a Regular Insulin sliding scale with good control of his
sugars. At the time of discharge , he should remain on his NPH
with sliding scale coverage.
FEN: The patient was placed on ADA diet and his electrolytes were
repleted p.r.n.
Prophylaxis: The patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. He was
also placed on a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic GERD.
Tubes , lines , and drains: The patient had an NG tube for a short
time during his Intensive Care Unit stay while was intubated for
enteral feeding. This was subsequently removed and the patient
has been able to take adequate p.o. intake. However , he has a
dual lumen peripherally inserted central catheter placed in his
right antecubital fossa on 11/19/03 for intravenous access for IV
heparin as well as to continue his 14-day course of ceftazidime.
Pertinent labs at the time of discharge include a BUN of 53 ,
creatinine of 2.2 , white blood cell count of 11.4 with 73% polys ,
20% lymphocytes , 6% monos , 2% eosinophils , and 1% basophils.
Hematocrit of 33.3 , which is stable , platelets of 175. His MCV
was 96.8 and his RDW was 18.0. His last PTT was 66.1 and INR was
1.3.
