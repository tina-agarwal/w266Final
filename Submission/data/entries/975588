**********
Hospital Course
Pt was admitted for observation and ROMI with stress test. There was low
suspicion for ACS given her history. However , pt with multiple CRF and
felt that inpatient stress was warranted ( last MIBI 2002 ).
Pt underwent chemical-MIBI on 6/25 ( hx of PVD can only walk 2 block
equivalent ) that was negative for any acute , reversible changes ( final
P ).
Unclear etiology for her pain. The diagnosis of potential pericarditis
was entertained , but again , the history was not consistent , no viral
prodome , no EKG changes , no pulsus/rub appreciated. No reproducible/MSK
pain.
Her pain was only controlled with oxycodone. She was pain-free at
discharge.Pt was continued on all her outpatient medications. no changes.
Pt will be discharged to home with follow-up already scheduled with Dr.
Hassenger , her cardiologist at the end of the month.
Of note pt had an elevated WBC ( 15.2 ) which seems to be chronic in nature.
No fevers , localizing signs/symptoms of infection.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: please continue to take the same medications as you were before this
admission. call your PCP to make an appointment in 1-2 weeks ( number
above ). Your cardiology appts with dr nik and surgery appointment
with dr. prosonic , also listed above.

breath , palpitations.
