Discharge Date: 4/2/2006
ATTENDING: STMARTIN , JASPER M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
65-year-old gentleman with history of insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia who
presented to his primary care physician with complaints of
exertional chest tightness for the past one to two months that is
relieved by rest. The patient underwent exercise
tolerance testing that elicited 2 mm diffuse ST depression as well
as a drop in systolic blood pressure and chest pain after 5
minutes of exercise. He was referred for cardiac
catheterization , which revealed 80% left main , 80% OM1 , 80%
diagonal 1 , and 70% serial LAD lesions as well as an 80% LPLV ,
and 70% RCA. He was referred for surgical revascularization.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension , diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy , and
hypercholesterolemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
None.
FAMILY HISTORY:
May be positive for coronary artery disease. Father died in her
early 50s from multiple medical issues.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Positive for alcohol use but the patient has not used in recent
months.
ALLERGIES:
Sulfa with unknown reaction.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. daily , aspirin
325 mg p.o. daily , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily ,
simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily , and Lantus 50 units subcutaneous
nightly.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Height 6 feet 0 inches tall , 68 kilos. Vital Signs: Temperature
is 97 , heart rate 53 , blood pressure 140/60 in right arm , 132/60
in left arm , and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. HEENT:
PERRL. Oropharynx benign. Neck without carotid bruits. Chest:
Without incisions. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , no
murmurs. Respiratory: Breath sounds are clear bilaterally.
Abdomen: Without incisions , soft , no masses. Extremities:
Without scarring , varicosities or edema , 2+ pedal and radial
pulses bilaterally. Allen's test in both upper extremities is
normal by pulse oximeter. Neuro: Alert and oriented , grossly
nonfocal exam.
PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:
Chemistries include sodium of 139 , potassium of 5.0 , BUN of 32 ,
and creatinine of 1.6. Hematology includes white blood cell
count of 6 , hematocrit of 36 , and INR of 1.1.
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm at 47 with ST elevations in V2 and V3
and biphasic T waves and aVL. Chest x-ray is normal.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 1/19/06 and underwent cardiac
catheterization with results as previously described. He also
underwent echocardiogram on 8/6/06 , which estimates ejection
fraction at 60% and finds trivial mitral insufficiency , trivial
tricuspid insufficiency , and mild left atrial enlargement. The
patient was taken to the operating room on 5/5/06 where he
underwent CABG x5 with LIMA to LAD and a sequential graft of SVG1
connecting the aorta to PDA and then LVB1. Left radial artery
connects to D1 and then OM1. The patient was taken to the
Intensive Care Unit following surgery in stable condition. He
was extubated later on his operative day and was noted to have a
slight
rise in his MB fraction. He was started on dopamine on
postoperative day #2 for low blood pressure and low urine output
as well as rising creatinine. His CK-MB was noted to have peaked
and was trending down. Postoperative day #3 , the patient was
weaned off of dopamine and his creatinine began to
trend down. On postoperative operative day 4 , the patient was
off all drips making good urine and given 1 unit of packed red
blood cells for a low hematocrit. He was transferred to the
Step-Down Unit later that day. At time of transfer , he was
hemodynamically stable and had been started on diltiazem for
spasm prophylaxis of his radial artery graft. The plan was to
avoid hypotension for renal perfusion and up titrate
beta-blockade carefully. He was saturating well on room air and
his diet was being advanced and was well tolerated. His
creatinine had fallen at time of transfer to 1.6 from its peak of
2.4 and continued to improve to its baseline levels by time of
discharge. The patient was followed perioperatively by the
Diabetes Management Service for glycemic control. He continued
to progress daily , remained in sinus rhythm and on room air for
the duration of his stay. His creatinine remained at baseline
level of 1.6. He continued to ambulate without problems and
was discharged home in good condition on postoperative day #7 on
the following medications: Diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be
continued for three months postoperatively for radial artery
graft , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n. constipation ,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , NovoLog insulin 8 units
subcutaneously at 8:00 a.m. , Lantus insulin 40 units
subcutaneously at 10:00 p.m. , Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. daily ,
Niferex 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n.
pain , Zocor 80 mg p.o. nightly , NovoLog insulin 4 units
subcutaneously with lunch and supper.
The patient is to have
follow-up appointments with his cardiologist , Dr. Luckner , in one to
two weeks and with his cardiac surgeon , Dr. Harclerode , in four to
six weeks.
