end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , hypertension , diabetes ,
prior stroke as well as a non-ST elevation MI with a right
coronary artery stent placed in May of 2005 who presents
with a one week history of cough and shortness of breath. On the
day of admission the patient experienced approximately 25

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Temperature 97 , heart rate
53 , blood pressure 143/52 , respiratory rate 20 and satting 100%
on room air. General: The patient was in no apparent distress ,
alert and oriented x3 with slow speech and a mild right-sided
facial droop. HEENT: Pupils were equal , round and reactive to
light , extraocular muscles intact , moist mucous membranes , JVP at
8 cm. Cardiovascular: Significant for 3/6 harsh systolic
ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border heard to the
carotids and also at the apex. Chest: Decreased respiratory
effort. No egophony , no crackles , no rhonchi. Abdomen soft ,
nontender , nondistended , normoactive bowel sounds. Back: The
patient has a decubitus ulcer on the sacrum. Extremities warm
and well perfused with 1+ pedal edema. Neurologic examination:
Cranial nerves II-XII intact , she did have some right lower
extremity weakness that has been chronic. Sensation testing was
intact throughout.
LABORATORY DATA: significant for potassium 3.3 ,
BUN 13 , creatinine od 2 , BNP 7900. One set of negative cardiac
enzymes. White blood cell count 3.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets
248 , INR 1.2 , EKG showed some new ST depressions in the inferior
and lateral leads that were new from prior. Chest x-ray; PA and
lateral showed a new ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe
likely representing pneumonia. Chest CT without contrast showed
no evidence of cavitary lesion within the lungs , a small area of
consolidation within the right upper lobe consistent with
possible pneumonia. A nodule in the right upper lobe that was 8
mm in size and stable from 2005 , but should be followed up
approximately every 6 months with follow up with CAT scan of the
chest. There were coronary calcifications.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious disease , the patient was admitted with a right
upper lobe pneumonia somewhat concerning for aspiration
pneumonia , pneumonia given that she was found to have a large
amount of secretions upon admission. She was initially treated
with vancomycin to cover for MRSA as well as ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. She had nasal swabs that were negative for
influenza A&amp;P. She also had a PPD placed on March , 2006 ,
that was negative. She had two sputum cultures that were sent
for AFB smears that were negative for acid fast bacilli. Her
vancomycin was discontinued after 24 hours. She has completed a
5-day course of azithromycin. She has to complete another 5
doses of cefpodoxime have outpatient that should be admitted
administered three times a week after hemodialysis. The patient
had a chest CT that showed no evidence for a cavitary lesion.
She does however have a pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe
that should be followed with interval CAT scans as an outpatient.
The patient also had a beta glucan and serum tests that are
currently pending. The patient has had negative culture data.
She was initially placed on tuberculosis precautions , however ,
given the absence of cavitary lesion on chest CT , negative PPD
and negative sputum cultures , the likelihood of TB was thought to
be extremely low and her precautions were discontinued.
2. Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient had a speech
and swallow evaluation for concern of aspiration. She was placed
on mechanical soft honey thick liquid diet that she should
continue upon discharge. She will likely need a repeat speech
and swallow evaluation while at rehabilitation and may possibly
need a video swallow examination if she continues to show signs
of aspiration. In addition , the head of her bed should be kept
elevated. The patient was also noted to have hypercalcemia
during this admission. The patient should have a serum protein
electrophoresis as an outpatient for further evaluation.
Currently , her calcium supplementation during dialysis has been
discontinued. In addition , her PTH level is currently pending
and should be followed up as an outpatient.
3. Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis. She undergoes hemodialysis Monday , Wednesday and
Friday and she should continue this upon discharge at the Alllou Lorda Hospital 
at Son Prai , 193 047 9532. She was
admitted to the renal service. She continues on Nephrocaps.
4. Cardiovascular: The patient had three sets of negative
cardiac enzymes and ruled out for myocardial infarction. The
patient is status post recent non-ST elevation MI was continued
on aspirin , Plavix , statin , ACE inhibitor , Beta-blocker. She
appeared euvolemic on examination.
5. GI: The patient was placed on a bowel regimen.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient received PPI and heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
7. Wound care: The patient was seen by the wound care consult
service for a stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer. She should have
DuoDERM dressing applied to this ulcer every three days. She
also benefits from an air mattress and vitamin C supplementation
as well.
8. Endocrine: The patient's TSH was normal at 1.12.
9. Hematology: The patient had evidence of anemia of chronic
disease. Folate was normal , B12 was normal.
10. Psych: The patient continued on Prozac for depression.
11. Neuro: The patient continued on Trileptal for her seizure
disorder.
CODE STATUS: The patient is full-code and her health care proxy
is her son.

needed for pain , not to exceed 4 grams a day , aspirin 81 mg p.o.

TO DO LIST:
1. Continue wound care for sacral decubitus ulcer.
2. Follow up with primary care provider to have serum protein
electrophoresis as outpatient as well as monitoring of her right
