1. ID , her blood cultures grew out coag-negative staphylococcus.
Her Hickman line was pulled and thought to be the source of
infection. She was started on vancomycin intravenously to
complete a 2-week course of vancomycin.
2. Musculoskeletal , the patient had has chronic hip and knee
pain secondary to avascular necrosis and also from her MVA that
she experienced , which likely exacerbated the pain. The
