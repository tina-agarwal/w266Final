w/o h/o MI/high cholesterol/DM. +smoking w/15 packyr smoking. Lipid
panel sent and pending on discharge. Dobutamine MIBI completed
showing moderate size anterior septal wall defect consistent with a
diagonal lesion. Due to the patient's size , this was a technically
very limited study and these results could only be stated with medium
probability. Pt unable to start ASA B/C of vWD but is already
medically managed with atenolol and lisinopril. Will need outpatient
follow up. HTN -- controlled on outpatient regimen of ATenolol 100
mg QD , Lisinopril 40 mg QD , Amlodipine 10 mg QD with SBP 120-150.
