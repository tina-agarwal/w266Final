CHIEF COMPLAINT: Back pain with radiation to left leg.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68 year old black
female who is status post a motor
vehicle accident in approximately 1968 and then again a fall in
1978. She complained of increasing lower back pain with radiation
to the left lower extremity for several months. This pain is now
accompanied by numbness in the left lateral aspect of the upper
leg , lower leg and foot with increasing pain and weakness. She was
unable to stand for long periods of time secondary to the pain and
the weakness and wears a brace on the leg. A CT scan in 3/18
showed spinal stenosis secondary to a disk bulging and facet joint
degeneration at level L4 to L5 with a grade I L4-5
spondylolisthesis and an L5-S1 central disk herniation with a left
nerve root impingement. PAST HISTORY: Hypertension; cardiomegaly;
total abdominal hysterectomy; tonsillectomy; right toe surgery.
She is gravida 0. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Isordil 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; Dyazide 50 mg p.o. daily. ALLERGIES: Aspirin causes GI
bleeding. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke; moderate alcohol.
No dietary restrictions. She is a divorced retired laundry worker.
FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension and myocardial
infarction. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unremarkable except for dyspnea on
exertion and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and the complaints noted
above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Afebrile; vital signs stable; height 5'11";
weight 185 pounds. She presented as a
moderately obese black female in no apparent distress. The skin
was clear. The nodes were normal. The extraocular motions were
intact; pupils equal , round and reactive to light. The oropharynx
was benign. The lungs were clear. The cardiac exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm; S1 and S2; no rubs , murmurs or gallops.
The peripheral pulses were intact. The abdomen was obese; positive
bowel sounds; no masses or organomegaly noted. Cranial nerves
II-XII were intact. Motor was grossly intact. Sensation was
decreased in the distal left lower extremity. She had global
hyperreflexia. Toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had a
positive left straight leg raise causing lower back pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room on
5/13/90 , where she underwent an L3-4-5 spinal
decompression laminectomy for spinal stenosis. At surgery there
was no any significant disk bulging noted , therefore , a diskectomy
was not performed. Postoperatively she did very well. Her only
significant complaint was of a burning sensation in the left
lateral thigh and occasionally in the right lateral thigh episodic
in nature. She claimed that she had had a burned injury to her
left lateral thigh in the past that had caused these burning
sensations to exist prior to her recent surgery. These sensations
were also relieved somewhat by ambulating , and it was felt that she
may have had some transient pressure on her lateral cutaneous
nerves during surgery and during her bedridden course following the
operation.
DISPOSITION: She was discharged following physical therapy
treatment on 1/22/90. FOLLOW UP will be in three
weeks in the orthopedic clinic with Dr. Dejulio MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE: Same as on admission plus Tylenol #3.
