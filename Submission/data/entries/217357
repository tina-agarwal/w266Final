HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to our service on 8/4/03
and stabilized for surgery. Date of surgery was

removed without incident. Patient's ambulation increased and
oxygen was successfully weaned off to room air. Patient was
saturating at 93%. Patient continued with an uncomplicated
hospital course. Gentle diuresis was continued and ambulation was
increased until the patient was evaluated to be stable to discharge
