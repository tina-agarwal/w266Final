BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mrs. Marnett is an 81 y.o. woman who presents with one day of
chest pain , difficulty speaking , nausea , and lightheadedness. She had
URI symptoms about two weeks ago and then 5d pta developed minimal
ly productive cough and then SOB for the past 2-3 days. She denies any
noctural dyspnea or increase in number of pillows. She lives alone ,
and a reverend checks up on her daily; the day prior to admission he
suggested she go to the hospital. She does not feel that she had any
speech difficulties at that time , but when she awoke she noted
heaviness of her tongue and workd finding difficulties. In addition , she
had sweating and chest pain that radiated to her shoulder ( L&gt;R ) , and
back. This was different than her usual anginal symptoms ( which do not
involve back radiation ). The pain was pleuritic in nature , and she
denied palpitations. She also noticed nausea and had several episodes
of dry heaving. While leaving the bathroom she had a single episode of
"lightheadness." This did not involve any sensation of vertigo , or any
vision changes. She sat down immediately , and felt better within a few
seconds. There was no fall and no LOC. Around 8am , her housekeeper
came , and immediately noticed a change in Mrs. Cooney 's voice. Mrs.
Solberg describes the change as a "thickening of my tongue" and some
problems finding words. She has been taking all of her medications as
prescribed over the last week.
ROS: On arrival to the floor , Mrs. Shoman noted a raised , painful
area on her L forearm. She does not recall any trauma to the area. She
denies any fever.

Hospital course by system:
Neuro: Speech difficulties: resolved by the time pt was in ER , making
diagnosis difficult. Possible etiologies include TIA or illness
exacerbating deficits from old stroke. Head CT in ER showed old
infarcts , but no acute process. Patient did not have any speech
difficulties throughout admission or other neurologic findings.
CV: ischemia: No ST changes on EKG , one set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. Given low probability of ischemia , no further enzymes were
drawn. Pump: EF 55% , patient was normotensive even after d/c of
some of her home HTN meds ( see renal ). Rhythm: pt was on telemetry for
first day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib.
Pulm: PNA: pt had left lower lobe opacity on CXR. Decision was made to
start antibiotics. Pt had a positive d-dimer , but PE was very unlikely
in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient has a
history of CHF , but had no signs of CHF on exam during this
hospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema.
Renal: ARF: Creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of
1.2-1.3. Given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam ,
this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. Her
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute to
further ARF , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1L ) and her
creatinine improved. However , after restarting her medications her Cr
again bumped to 1.8. Her UA was unremarkable. She was d/c home off
lasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a Cr of 1.8 presuming that sh
e was still prerenal. The plan is for VNA to check her chem7 in 3days
days , results to go to Dr. Skibo for monitoring and deciding when to
restart her medications.
MSK: Pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hosp
for the first night. A radiograph was negative for fracture and it was
felt to be a small hematoma. The pain remitted with Tylenol. At
discharge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced.
Heme: Anticoagulation. She was maintained on her home dose of INR was
maintained in a theraputic range. This will have to be closely
monitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. Her INR was 3 after 2
days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by VNA 3 days
after discharge , results to be followed by Sheldon Dingmann
Endo: D.M. Pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd given
her worsening renal insufficiency. Fingersticks remained in acceptable
range ( 100-148 ) during admission.
Dispo: to home with close VNA followup ( daily ). Pt will have weight
and BP checked qd. She will have Chem-7 and INR drawn on Thursday and
Monday , and the results will be called to Dr. Benamati ( TERT VALLEY HOSPITAL CENTER ). She will
finish 6 more days of Levo ( total 10 ).
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: If you develop a fever , become short of breath , have increasing left arm
pain , or any other symptoms that concern you , call your doctor.
The visiting nurse is an important followup to your
hospitalization.Your diabetes medication was changed to glipizide -stop
taking the micronase. Your lasix , lisinopril and colchicine have been
stopped , don't restart them until Dr. Schoville tells you to restart. Your othe
medications are the same. Weigh yourself daily and if your weight increa
ses more than 2lbs in 2 days call Dr. Szesterniak
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. VNA will check BP and weight qd. Any BP &gt; 140/90 or wt gain of 2
lbs in 2 days will be called to Dr. Kempf ( BROTHERSCIAL GITER HEALTHCARE OF 773-511-3611 )
2. Thursday ( 3 of May ) and Mon ( 26 of January ) VNA will draw a Chem-7 and INR
and call results to Dr. Maria ( WA ASSPUNX HOSPITAL ); INR should be communicated to Blaine Lindquist at 207-809-4454.
3. Pt has followup appointment on 24 of September at 10:30am with
Dr. Speranza 4. There are 6 more days of Levofloxacin course.
