ATTENDING: MOHOROVICH , BARRY MD
DATE OF ADMISSION: 10/30/06
DATE OF DISCHARGE: 6/1/06
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This patient is a 72-year-old female with a left plantar fifth
metatarsal ulcer since 3/22 The patient previously had an
ulcer in the same area , which healed successfully. The patient
had recurrence of her neuropathic ulcer and it has worsened and
deepened with progression to osteomyelitis involving the
metatarsal phalangeal joint. The patient's wound healing has
been confounded by longstanding lower extremity edema and as
well as congestive heart failure and venous stasis. The
ulcer has been previously treated with debridement , however , in
2/15 , it became infected and the patient developed left lower
extremity cellulitis , which progressed to the knee. The patient
was treated with antibiotics and subsequently developed profuse
diarrhea and was found to have a Clostridium difficile infection.
The patient was treated with oral Flagyl and vancomycin. She
presents on admission with continued loose stool. The patient
had previously undergone a three-phase bone scan , which was
positive for osteomyelitis and then confirmed by a gallium scan.
The patient has had decreased sensation from bilateral mid tibia
extending distally and denies pain. The patient is admitted from
a rehabilitation facility where she undergoes physical therapy.
At baseline , the patient has poor ambulation and is wheelchair
bound. The patient's cardiovascular risk factors include her
diabetes , venous stasis , coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
elevated cholesterol , and neuropathy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Lower extremity edema and venous stasis.
2. Right knee gout.
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy , requiring AICD.
4. Status post removal of thyroid tumor.
5. Status post triple bypass coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.
6. Status post multiple myocardial infarctions.
7. Status post placement of coronary stents.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. at night , gabapentin 300 mg p.o. at
bedtime , allopurinol 150 mg p.o. daily , torsemide 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , fentanyl patch 50 mcg an
hour q.72 h. , potassium chloride 80 mEq daily , omeprazole 20 mg
daily , Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , vancomycin 250 mg orally three times
a day , Flagyl 500 mg three times a day , NPH insulin 25 units in
the morning , and oxycodone 5 mg q.4 h. p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES:
Sulfa causes angioedema.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
On 8/20/2006 , the patient underwent debridement of her left foot
and amputation of the left fifth metatarsal phalangeal joint. On
10/4/2006 , the patient underwent closure of her wound.
OTHER TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES:
CT angiogram:
1. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease with multiple focal areas of
mild-to-moderate stenosis seen in the origin of the SMA ,
bilateral renal arteries , common and superficial femoral arteries
and popliteal arteries.
2. Occlusion of the mid third of the posterior tibial artery
with distal reformation on the right side.
3. Three-vessel run off in the left leg.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service on
8/20/2006 after undergoing her amputation. No concerning
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative
note for details. She was transferred to the floor from the PACU
in stable condition. The patient had adequate pain control and
was tolerating a regular diet by postoperative day #0. She was
placed on a fluid restriction in light of her congestive heart
failure. The patient's wound was clean with no evidence of
hematoma collection. She underwent wet-to-dry dressing changes
t.i.d. The patient underwent a CT angiogram to evaluate her
lower extremity vasculature; please see the results noted above
in the procedure section. In summary , the patient's three-vessel
run off to the left lower extremity indicated that she would not
likely need a bypass for wound healing at this time. In
addition , because the patient's wound was clean , Dr. Fregeau deemed
that it is appropriate to proceed the closure of the wound. As a
result , on 10/4/2006 , the patient returned to the operating room
and underwent closure of her wound; please see Dr. Visage 's
dictated operative note for details of this procedure. Following
both of the patient's procedures , her pain was well controlled
with oral pain medications. The patient's cardiovascular status
remained stable postoperatively. She did continue on her
home/rehabilitation facility medication regimen for her
cardiovascular issues. The patient remained stable from a
respiratory standpoint. The patient did continue to have loose
bowel movements during her hospital stay. She continued on her
admission regimen for Clostridium difficile , which consisted of
oral Flagyl and oral vancomycin. There were multiple attempts to
save a stool specimen; either the patient did not save the stool
at times or it was mixed with copious amounts of urine. As a
result , a Clostridium difficile test is pending at the time of
discharge and will need to be followed up for test of cure while
at rehabilitation. The patient's hemodynamic status was
monitored closely as well as her fluid status. The patient was
placed on a 1500 mL fluid restriction due to her CHF. The
patient did have a slight rise in her creatinine from 1.4 to 1.8 ,
at the time of discharge , the patient's creatinine was trending
back down to 1.4. The patient's electrolytes were monitored and
repeated as necessary during her hospital stay. The patient
received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis while as an
inpatient. The patient's cultures from the operating room were
positive for MRSA , and as a result , she continued on IV
vancomycin. The patient is to continue her IV vancomycin regimen
through follow up with Dr. Gittins in clinic. The patient was seen
by the Diabetes Management Service for evaluation of her diabetes
as her blood sugars were elevated on her admission regimen. As a
result , the Diabetes Management Service recommended a regimen
consisting of 25 units of NPH in the morning , 8 units of NPH at
bedtime , a standing NovoLog regimen of 4 units with meals in
addition a NovoLog sliding scale with meals and at bedtime. The
remainder of the patient's hospital course was relatively
unremarkable and she is to be discharged in stable condition back
to rehabilitation with adequate pain control. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow up in clinic with Dr. Kegerries in one to two weeks.
