LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION: Sodium 133 , potassium 5.7 ,
chloride 98 , bicarb 24 , BUN 32 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose 536 ,
calcium 7.6 , magnesium 2. albumin 3. ALT 99 , AST 54 , alkaline
phosphatase 229 , total bilirubin 0.3 , amylase 16 , lipase 20 , CK
218 , MB 4.3 , troponin less than assay. Second set of enzymes
were CK 327 , MB 6.1 , troponin less than assay , serum OSM 329.
White count of 10.06 , hematocrit 41.5 , platelets 274 , PT 13 , PTT
27 , INR 1.0. D-dimer greater than 4000. ABG: On BiPAP , was
7.23 , 65 , 97. Urine tox showed barbiturates , benzos and opioids.
UA 1.025/5.5/2+ protein , 3+ glucose , trace ketones , 1+ blood , +
nitrate , 5-8 white blood cells , 2-4 red blood cells , 4+ bacteria ,
0-2 epithelial cells. EKG: Showed sinus rhythm at 90 , normal
axis , normal intervals , flat Ts in precordium , Q and III
unchanged from 0/16 Chest x-ray was limited due to soft
tissue , left upper lung clear , rest of study non-diagnostic.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Pulmonary: Maintained on BiPAP and nasal canula with sats and
the ABG improving on transfer from MICU. On 10/28/2003 , ABG at
the time showed , was 7.31/74/71 , consistent with chronic
hypercarbia. Given the asymmetric leg swelling , PE and DVT was
suspected , however , unable to obtain further imaging due to
patient's size. D-dimer greater than 4000 , empirically
anticoagulated with Lovenox. Ten-A levels were supratherapeutic
initially trending down. PICC line placed in order to obtain
more regular Ten-A levels but then had to be removed ( see below ).
Given patient's size and risk for DVT , patient sent to rehab on
Lovenox.
2. CV-Ischemia: The patient had a troponin bump to 1.09 on third
set of enzymes without EKG changes. Thought to be secondary to
pulmonary disease , ? right heart strain in setting of PE.
Troponin trending down on second assay. Aspirin , beta-blocker ,
statin continued.
Pump: Echo showed an EF of 65% with moderate right ventricular
stain consistent with prior echo and pulmonary hypertension ,
evidence of fluid overload , patient diuresed on IV Lasix with
good improvement.
Rhythm: No active issues.
3. Heme: Anticoagulated empirically for presumed DVT/PE on
Lovenox. Hematocrit stable.
4. Infectious Disease: UA was 4+ bacteria initially on
levofloxacin , Foley removed 10/6/2003.
5. Endocrine: Initially maintained on insulin drip in MICU ,
transported to floor and maintained on NPH/RISS. Blood sugars
remained 150s-250s on stable NPH regimen.
6. Renal: 2/25/2003 with high bicarb , 37 , in setting of heavy
diuresis , suspect contraction alkalosis. Spironolactone added to
regimen with good effect.
7. Pain: Patient has chronic pain medications , left on home
doses of Vicodin , and diazepam and Percocet.
8. Access: PICC line placed 10/28/2003 for lab access , unable to
get reliable access , but arm swelling on 7/27/2003 , removed PICC
line , patient started on Keflex , 5-day course , for
thrombophlebitis , question cellulitis , suspected in setting of
left arm swelling greater than right and tenderness.
9. Disposition: PT/OT feels patient unsafe to go home. Patient
needs consistent exercise , diet regimen , in addition to greif
counseling ( patient lost 15-year-old son two years ago and
reports increased weight gain after his death , in addition to
symptoms of depression ).
