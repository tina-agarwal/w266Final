BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
88 year old man who comes in from rehab with ?hypothermia and rigors. 6
weeks ago the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the finger. He
had a PICC line placed and was discharged with IV abx. At the tail end of
his antibiotic regimen he spiked a fever and was admitted to VOWH .  His
course of antibiotics was extended and he was discharged to rehab on
ceftriaxone and vanc. Today at the nursing home he was observed to be
"shaking" and the staff was concerned for rigors. However , the patient
says his hands were just quivering. At the time , his temp at rehab was 92
degrees. He was sent to the ED for evaluation.
In the ED , his temperature was normal. He was not complaining of further
chills or rigors. However , his EKG demonstrated new ST depressions in
V3-V5. The patient denied any CP/N/SOB/diaphoresis. His first set of
enzymes were negative. He was given aspirin.
