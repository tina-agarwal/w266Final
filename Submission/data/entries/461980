Discharge Date: 11/29/1995
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY
2. ASTHMA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41 year old
Afro-American woman who has the
diagnosis of inferior wall myocardial infarction on 3/23/95
transferred from Rahert Hospital for postmyocardial infarction
angina.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension , smoking , family history of
coronary artery disease , and CVA. No
diabetes. She is not postmenopausal , no history of elevated
cholesterol. No previous myocardial infarction history.
Two and a half weeks prior to admission while sorting mail , she had
20 minutes of Cushing substernal chest pressure , increased
shortness of breath with diaphoresis and radiation down the left
arm and across to the right chest. Initially , she thought she had
gastrointestinal distress. Pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours after
eating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable if
affected by position. There were no EKG changes. In the intervening
period she had several additional episodes of this pain and
presented to HMC where she was treated with Disalcid and Tagamet.
The pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until 3/23/95 when she
presented to LSSHA with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chest
pressure. She was sent to Ai Community Hospital where she ruled in for
myocardial infarction with a CK equal to 1508 MB fractions. MB of
126 with a peak of 1900 on 0/13 EKG demonstrated Q waves in 3 and
ADF. T waves aversions of 2 ST segment depressions in V2 through
V5. She was treated with IV nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,
diltiazem , Metoprolol and aspirin. She apparently had additional
pain while on this regimen and was transferred to the Campte Hospital for catheterization and management.
MEDICATIONS: Her medications as an outpatient were only
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. Upon transfer her
medications included Colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once a
day , Diltiazem CD 240 mg once a day , Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , IV
nitroglycerin , IV heparin , and Percocet for pain.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies , but has an allergy to seafood
- she gets hives.
FAMILY HISTORY: As above. Coronary artery disease and
cerebrovascular accident in the early 40's in both
her father and mother.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She smokes one pack a day of cigarettes for the
past 20 years with occasional alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit at
the Mouth- Butlham Hospital is notable
for a blood pressure of 130/85 , the pulse is 79 , respiratory rate
of 16 to 20 on three liters of 100% face mask. HEENT exam -
sclerae are anicteric , pupils equal and reactive to light ,
extraocular movements are intact , oropharynx were clear. There were
no carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. Chest -
there was a poorly healed scar on the anterior chest. Lungs were
clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. No CVA
tenderness. Cardiac exam - PMI nondisplaced , regular rate and
rhythm , normal S1 , split S2. There is a 2 out of 6 whooshing
crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border that radiates to the apex. There was an S4. Abdomen - obese
with a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. No
hepatosplenomegaly. Femoral pulses are intact with a right bruit.
Extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Reflexes were intact. Toes were
downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY ON ADMISSION: Notable for potassium of 3.8 , a white
blood cell count of 13.6 , hematocrit of
37.8 , platelets of 179 , magnesium 2.3 and CK of 201 , PT-PTT 13.2 ,
59 with an INR of 1.2. Urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 white
blood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+
leukocyte esterase. There were no effusions or evidence of failure
on chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman with
multiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for
an inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing
postmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina
versus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support
this. In the IH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,
aspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IV
nitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled for
a catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer with
pretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfish
allergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 7/27/95
with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,
pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM
( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive with
good distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries were
deemed normal. On the 4 of June , the patient was transferred
out of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note ,
postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruit
on the right which was there prior to catheterization. An
echocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%
with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the
4 of June , the patient was noted to have a white blood cell
count of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T wave
inversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG's from
5/4 The patient's MI was felt to be consistent with a lesion
from the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at this
time that the increased white blood cell count was most likely
secondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior to
catheterization. The patient's does of Lopressor was increased to
75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. She was
continued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin and
continued on cardiac monitor. On the 9 of June , the patient
had an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left
arm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight
diaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was being
weaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse
of 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new
murmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be a
sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and R
which were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2
which were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given one
sublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up.
She was likewise given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor for recontrol and
Serax 15 mg x one. Her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 with
these interventions with no radiation in the arm. She described it
as a heaviness. Blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. EKG at
this point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. T
wave inversions in 3R ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 , V3 , V5
with T wave sinusoidality and V6 T wave slightly inverted. IV
nitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was divided
and oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. Patient was
pain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg IV Lopressor
was given for better late recontrol. Duration of total episode was
approximately 20 minutes. The pain-free EKG was notable for a rate
of 78 wit V5 T wave more upright than sinusoidal and V6 T wave
upright , else no change. The IV TNG was dialed up further for a
blood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. A second bolus of IV
morphine was obtained at this time. CK and Isoenzymes were sent
and Cardiology attending was made aware. The patient was made NPO
in case of any need for catheterization the following morning if
symptoms were to recur. The CK following this event was magnified
with a triponin I of 14.1. On the 9 of June it was deemed
appropriate to continue with the IV heparin one more day and
control symptoms with IV nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were to
increase , it was still deemed appropriate to considering this
patient for recurrent cath. On the 6 of September , the patient
returned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%
distal left circumflex stenosis. There was a PTCA performed of this
distal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. A stent was
placed in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.
The lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%
stenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in the
proximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for a
total of three stents in place in the left circumflex. EKG's were
stable postcatheterization. There was no remarkable hematoma in the
right groin. CK postcatheterization was 64. On the 28 of January
the patient's Lopressor was changed to Atenolol and the patient was
started on Coumadin for the stents. The patient at this time on
5 of January had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with a
blood pressure of 120/75% , O2 sats were 99%. As the patient was
being coumadinized on the 11 of March , she had a
supertherapeutic response coumadinization with an INR of 5.7. The
plan was to recheck the INR to secure a downward trend as well as
to start planning for discharge. On the 2 of July , the INR
was 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximum
INR , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.
DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged home on November with
followup with Dr. Mathur and Dr. Stailey at the For Nali Hospital
