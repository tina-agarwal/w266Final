Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: WAXMAN , MARCELLUS H. MD , PHD
SERVICE:
CCU Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease and aspirin allergy.
LIST OF PROBLEMS:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Peptic ulcer disease.
5. Colonic polyps.
6. Prostate adenocarcinoma.
7. Pancreatic cancer , metastatic.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Galle is a 67-year-old man with cardiac risk factors
including hypertension , hypercholesterolemia. His CAD history
begins one year ago when he began to experience resting jaw pain
responsive to two to three sprays of nitroglycerin. On 10/9/05 ,
he presented to Woodterra Raville Center with this pain and he was found to
have T wave inversion , ST depressions in V6 , V1 and aVL. At that
point , his cardiac markers peaked at troponin of 29.6. He was
taken to the catheterization lab where he was found to have a 90%
RCA stenosis. He underwent angioplasty and bare metal stent
placement. After the catheterization , he had six weeks without
pain but over the last two weeks he had begun to experience
increasing jaw pain that was minimally responsive to
nitroglycerin spray. He presented for elective recatheterization
on 9/11 the day of his admission and was found to have 70% LAD
lesion and a 40% proximal RCA lesion. A Cypher stent was placed
in the LAD. He was started on Integrilin for 24 hours and sent
to the CCU for aspirin desensitization. He has taken aspirin for
headaches in his teens and developed rashes. He had taken
aspirin a few times in his 20s and 30s without any recalled side
effects. However , he did take 12 years ago , a dose of
indomethacin and reportedly had to be inducted into a coma in the
hospital for severe adverse reaction to the indomethacin. He
cannot elaborate further on what this reaction was. Therefore ,
given the need to be on aspirin for his new Cypher stent , he was
admitted to the CCU for a course of desensitization.
PREADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
Include Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily , Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. ,
captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m. ,
Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily , Creon six tablets p.o. daily , Lantus 4
units subcutaneous q.h.s. , Humalog subcutaneous with meals , as
needed nitroglycerin sublingual tablets.
ALLERGIES:
Include aspirin , penicillin and NSAIDs which produce rash.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No tobacco , alcohol or other drug use history. He lives with his
wife and performs clerical work and can perform activities of
daily living without issue.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Mother had esophageal cancer , his father had renal cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 96.9 , pulse 87 , blood pressure 130/60 , O2 saturation
97% on room air. His exam was significant for being thin ,
fatigued man with mild icterus , mildly bleeding gums. JVP at 11
cm. III/VI harsh systolic murmur at the base. III/IV diastolic
murmur at the base. His lung exam was clear bilaterally. His
abdomen was soft , nontender with two ventral hernias without
issue. He was alert and oriented x3 and had mild 1+ edema
bilaterally.
LABORATORY VALUES:
His white count was 5.4 , hematocrit 30.2 , platelets 251 , 000.
Creatinine was 1.2 after catheterization. His INR was 1.3. CK
was 42 , troponin 0.12.
PROCEDURES:
Catheterization went without event with stenting of his LAD 70%
lesion with Cypher stent.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac. Mr. Celeste cardiac catheterization went
smoothly with identified 70% mid proximal LAD lesion and proximal
40% RCA lesion. A Cypher stent was placed in the LAD , and he was
started on Integrelin and sent to the CCU. His Plavix and Imdur
were continued as per his home dose. His beta-blocker and ACE
inhibitor were held for anticipation of aspirin desensitization.
He did not experience any further chest pain or jaw pain during
his stay and was stable hemodynamically.
2. Allergy. It was agreed that his aspirin should be taken
given that he now has a Cypher stent. Given his vague history of
possible aspirin allergy and question of anaphylactic shock
induced by NSAIDs , it was decided to desensitize him to 81 mg of
aspirin. This was done as per protocol defined by Allergy
Consult Service with doubling increments starting at 5 mg and
going to 81 mg of aspirin over the course of two hours every 30
minutes. Epinephrine and Benadryl were kept at bedside but were
not required because he had no adverse reaction to any of the
doses.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on all his
home medications as previously prescribed plus aspirin 81 mg each
day. He was instructed that it was important to take his aspirin
every day because if he missed a dose he may have an allergic
reaction that his desensitization was designed to avoid.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. to be started one day after
discharge.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.
4. Imdur 90 mg q.a.m. and q.p.m.
5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. Creon six tablets p.o. daily.
7. Lantus 4 units subcutaneous q.h.s.
8. Humalog subcutaneous with meals.
9. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual as needed.
10. Aspirin 81 mg every day.
FOLLOW UP:
The patient was instructed to call the Asound Hospital
Allergy Service for outpatient appointment within two to four
weeks. He was to contact the Onco/Allergy fellow if he
experiences any itching or rash in the next few days.
