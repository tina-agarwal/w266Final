Discharge Date: 4/28/2003
CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 72-year-old man with a history of
significant coronary artery disease , status post
CABG x 2 , stents and brachytherapy who was admitted for an NSVT
leading to fatigue and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient's symptoms first developed
last July , 2002 when he noticed
fatigue and shortness of breath. He had recently developed
bacteremia after a colonoscopy and never felt that he had quite
recovered. He was being treated with atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. at
the time for his coronary artery disease. His wife and son , who
are a nurse and a PA , respectively , felt his pulse and it was
frequently in the 30s , but was also occasionally normal. He
decreased his atenolol to 25 mg once a day but his symptoms
persisted. He was seen as an outpatient and found to have frequent
PVCs on EKG.
Over the past few months the patient has also noticed increased
angina , both with and without activity. He has had increased
difficulty walking up the stairs causing chest pain and shortness
of breath that are relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. Then two
days prior to admission the patient also noticed pain at rest but
was again relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. On the morning of
admission he felt chest heaviness that woke him up from sleep. He
did not take any nitroglycerin but his wife told him that he was
"gasping for breath". Over the past month he had been seeing his
cardiologist , Dr. Verdun . Because of his shortness of breath he
was started on Lasix for 3-4 days but this also did not relieve his
symptoms. He had Holter monitoring with exercise , going up and
down the stairs , at clinic and this also showed frequent PVCs. He
had an electrocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 30%.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. He had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1974 and 1982. He had
PCI of his left main coronary artery 3/23 and PTCA and
brachytherapy secondary to in-stent restenosis in May , 2002.
Intervention 3/23 his left main was radiated. His bypass
vessels are LIMA/LAD , SVG/marginal 1 , LIMA/LAD , SVG/RPDA.
2. He had a significant GI bleed secondary to aspirin and
Plavix in 2002. His hematocrit went to 17. The patient has
remained on aspirin and Plavix secondary to his coronary
artery disease.
3. History of prostate cancer treated with radiation , complicated
by radiation prostatitis.
4. Diabetes.
5. Status post right carotid endarterectomy. No history of TIAs
or strokes.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin 81 mg; Plavix 75 mg; atenolol 25
mg once a day; Isordil 60 mg twice a
day; lisinopril 20 mg once a day; Norvasc 5 mg once a day; Lipitor
10 mg once a day; gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day; hydroxyzine 25 mg
twice a day; Glyburide 10 mg twice a day; metformin 1 , 000 mg twice
a day; Nexium 40 mg once a day; iron sulfate 300 mg once a day;
calcium 1250 twice a day; multivitamin once a day; vitamin E; folic
acid; Colace.
FAMILY HISTORY: He has several siblings with coronary artery
disease in their 60s.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former engineer for Ssand Lare , but
stopped working when he was in his 40s because of
his coronary artery disease. He denies any tobacco , alcohol , or
drug use. He lives with his wife.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Two-pillow orthopnea that is stable , no
palpitations.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 95.1 , heart rate
58 , blood pressure 112/50 , breathing 22 ,
satting 98% on room air. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact.
Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation. JVP
was 10.0 cm with a right carotid endarterectomy scar.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal S1S2. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft , nontender , nondistended , positive
bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: No lower extremity edema. NEURO:
Cranial nerves II-XII intact.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission. Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 ,
chloride 104 , bicarb 23 , BUN 35 , creatinine 1.5
his baseline is 1.4 , glucose 148 , white count 9.0 , hematocrit 37 ,
platelets 297. Liver function tests were within normal limits. CK
125 , MB 1.6 , troponin 0.02.
Electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and 2-3 beats of
normal sinus rhythm interspersed with NSVT.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: Ischemia: It was unclear
whether the patient's worsening chest pain was
from progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this was
demand ischemia from his frequent NSVT. He was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction by enzymes but given the persistence of his
arrhythmia , he was taken for catheterization. His catheterization
showed an LAD 100% lesion , diag 1 80% lesion , left circumflex 100%
lesion , the ramus was widely patent , RCA showed a 100% lesion ,
right PDA 100% lesion. Overall , his LIMA graft to the LAD was
widely patent , his SVG graft to marginal 1 and SVG graft to RCA
were both occluded but had collaterals. What was new from his
previous catheterization was disease in his PDA. It was determined
to further treat the patient's coronary artery disease with medical
management. After his heart rate was controlled with amiodarone
and with a pacemaker , he did however continue to have some fatigue
and shortness of breath. As a result he had an adenosine MIBI to
evaluate for functional ischemia given the findings on his
catheterization. The MIBI showed a moderate sized perfusion defect
throughout the inferior and basal inferoseptal and inferolateral
walls showing a moderate amount of reversibility. His ejection
fraction was estimated at 50% with akinesis of the inferior and
inferoseptal walls with reduced thickening. He did not have any
EKG changes during the procedure. His beta blockade was increased
to Lopressor 50 b.i.d. and he continued on his nitrates. He was
actually able to tolerate ambulation without feeling any pain or
shortness of breath. It is possible that the symptoms that he had
later on in the hospitalization were secondary to volume overload
which responded well to diuresis. He will follow up with Dr.
Rafi . It is unlikely that any intervention will be able to be
done but he will explore this as an outpatient.
2 ) Pump: The patient did experience some shortness of breath
several days into his admission. He had been approximately four
liters positive over several days. He was given 20 mg of IV Lasix
and responded well. He was sent home with 20 mg of Lasix q. Monday
and Thursday.
3 ) Rhythm: The patient's electrocardiogram and telemetry strips
were concerning because while he was technically in normal sinus
rhythm , he was usually only in normal sinus rhythm for 3-4 beats at
a time at most , and in between that , had several runs of NSVT. The
NSVT never progressed to sustained V-TAC and the patient was always
hemodynamically stable. However , there was concern that this could
ultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He
was loaded on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. which he tolerated
well. He also required an additional 150 mg IV x 1 load to
stabilize his rhythm. He had an ICD and DDI pacemaker placed on
5/26 without complication. After the pacemaker was placed he was
still experiencing some fatigue and it was thought that he may have
been overpaced. As a result his settings were adjusted to increase
his AV delayed 240 and he was changed to DDD mode. He also had a
number of beats shortened that would be required to detect the VT ,
to 24. By the time of discharge his amiodarone was decreased to
400 mg q.d. This may ultimately be decreased even further to 200
but will be decided by Dr. Swymer .
4 ) Endocrinology: The patient has a history of diabetes. We held
his metformin on admission because of his catheterization but
restarted it upon discharge. Any elevated blood sugars were
covered with an insulin sliding scale.
5 ) Pulmonary: As mentioned above the patient did have some
shortness of breath which was likely due to volume overload. He
responded well to 20 mg IV Lasix. He always maintained his oxygen
saturations. He will have pulmonary function tests as an
outpatient to establish a baseline given his new treatment with
amiodarone.
6 ) Heme: The patient does have a history of a GI bleed on aspirin
and Plavix. We monitored his hematocrit closely. He came in at
37. It did decrease to 31. During his hospitalization he had an
episode of bright red blood per rectum. Given his history of
radiation proctitis and proctatitis it is not surprising that he
had this. He always remained hemodynamically stable and did not
require any transfusions. At baseline his hematocrit is probably
closer to 33 and it is likely that the 37 was an elevation from
decreased p.o. intake. Follow up stools were guaiac-negative.
FOLLOWUP: He will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. Halvorson and
Fabus on 7/11/03 . He will also have pulmonary
function tests on 0/29 .
