Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: PASCULLI , MONTY M. M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Acute coronary syndrome.
DIAGNOSIS AT DISCHARGE: Includes the following; ST elevation
acute myocardial infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS AT DISCHARGE: Post-MI pericarditis , mural
thrombus , type II diabetes mellitus , colonoscopy with colon
polypectomy in 1991 , hypercholesterolemia , status post umbilical
hernia repair , and questionable hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Scorzelli is
72-year-old female with a history of hypercholesterolemia , type
II diabetes mellitus , past smoking , and questionable
hypertension , but no known cardiac disease , who presented to this
hospital with vague epigastric pain/chest pain exacerbated by
deep inspiration and on lying flat. The pain persisted for more
than 48 hours , 10/10 in intensity and prevented her from sleep
finally leading to her presentation to the emergency department
on August , 2005 , where EKG showed Q waves in the anterior
leads with ST elevation in inferior leads II , III , and aVF. She
had elevated enzymes. Her troponin peaked to 20. A bedside
transthoracic echo showed anterior wall motion abnormality. She
was started on aspirin , heparin , Plavix , Integrilin , and
Lopressor , and the patient was taken to the catheterization lab
where she was found to have a 100% proximal LAD lesion and a hazy
90% lesion to the ramus. Two Cypher stents were deployed to the
LAD. The procedure is complicated by no-reflow phenomenon. One
Cypher stent was placed in the ramus branch. Right heart
catheterization revealed RA of 12 , RV 36/7 , PA 38/18 , and no
step-up in oxygenation in the right heart. The patient was
transferred to the CCU where her chest pain persisted. The pain
was positional , increased by deep inspiration and it was felt to
be likely post-MI pericarditis. Her EKG changes persisted , but
her enzymes clearly were trending downwards. The diagnosis of
post-MI pericarditis is consistent with echo findings showing
adhesions between the myocardium and pericardium. An
echocardiogram obtained after the percutaneous coronary
intervention showed an LVEF of 35%. The left ventricular size
was normal. The right ventricle was normal in size and the
thickness of the right ventricle was also normal. There was mild
tricuspid regurgitation. There was mild pericardial thickening
with the areas of adhesions at the pericardium near the apex and
there was a trivial pericardial effusion. Also , a mural sessile
thrombus was observed near the apex of the heart. Her EKG
changes continued to show ST elevation in lead II , III , aVF , V2
through V6 , Q waves in D2 , D3 , and aVF , and she also intermittent
right bundle-branch block morphology. She was treated for
ischemia with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers titrated to
achieve a pulse in the 70s to 80s. We did not increase it
further because of her low ejection fraction she was unlikely to
tolerate such high doses. She was started on aspirin and Plavix ,
which she continued for her myocardial function. She was placed
on eplerenone and Lasix to achieve a dry weight estimated to be
78 kilograms. This should be her goal weight. She has also been
receiving captopril , ACE inhibitors , for left ventricular
remodeling. Rhythm wise , there has been no arrhythmia noted on
telemetry on which she has been throughout her hospital stay.
For her pericarditis , she initially received 650 mg of aspirin 4
times a day. She was continued on this , but later the dose was
reduced as other anticoagulants were started. She was given
tramadol for her pain with improvement of her pericarditis pain.
Given her mural thrombus , she was anticoagulated initially with
heparin achieving the therapeutic PTT of 80 seconds
approximately. She was later bridged to Coumadin with a target
INR of 2. A higher INR should be avoided thus to avoid
hemopericardium. Endocrine wise , she was treated for her
diabetes with an insulin regimen that consists of Lantus and
Regular Insulin. A cardiac MRI was obtained on February , 2005 ,
with following findings. She had moderate to global left
ventricular dysfunction with basal to distal and anteroseptal
akinesis , apical akinesis , and distal inferior dyskinesis. Her
estimated EF was 38%. There is full-thickness delayed
enhancement of the myocardium indicating a 7th segment , out of
the total of 17 segments , myocardial infarction. There was a
large area of no-reflow within the myocardial infarction , which
is consistent with microvascular thrombosis. The distal or the
free wall is also hypokinetic raising the possibility of right
ventricular involvement from the myocardia l infarction. A
concentric moderate-sized pericardial effusion with exudative
features was also seen. The thickest area of the pericardial
effusion appears to be on the dependent aspect measuring 12 mm in
thickness. There is no right ventricular or right atrial
collapse or compression. Renal wise , she had no issues. Her
creatinine was always below 1 , mostly 0.7 or 0.8.
DISPOSITION: Her plan for disposition is to go to rehab. She
has been evaluated by physical therapy.
An addendum will be dictated with the current status of the
patient and her discharge medications at the time that she is
actually discharged from the hospital.
