Discharge Date: 7/15/2005
ATTENDING: BOGGIANO , COLUMBUS WILTON MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Ventricular fibrillation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Forbess is a 75-year-old man
with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15% status post ICD
and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis who was
admitted on August , 2005 after his ICD fired at home for
ventricular fibrillation. He notes a productive cough , a
subjective fever and nausea and vomiting at home. He was
subsequently seen in Electrophysiology Clinic. He had a low
grade fever of 100.0 at that time. He was electively admitted
but on the way to the floor , his ICD fired again. He was given
lidocaine and after a third firing of his ICD , he was begun on
amiodarone. The patient then became short of breath and was in
pulmonary edema , requiring intubation. Chest x-ray showed a
right upper lobe white out. The patient was taken to Cath for
possible ischemia contributing to his ventricular fibrillation.
He had a proximal 80% LAD lesion and a mid 70% LAD lesion which
were both stented with Seifer stents. He also had a 60% D1
lesion which was angioplastied to a residual 40% lesion. He also
had a 70% left circumflex lesion. After catheterization , the
patient was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. He was
continued on his amiodarone load. He had no further arrhythmias
during his ICU stay. He was extubated the following day and was
diuresed for congestive heart failure. He also began treatment
for both community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
He was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on March ,
2005.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , EF of 15% , status
post ICD and biventricular pacer , moderate aortic stenosis ,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , diabetes , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , and
hypothyroidism.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Synthroid.
2. Lasix.
3. Coumadin.
4. Lopressor.
5. Lorazepam.
6. Colace.
7. Prilosec.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon transfer out of the Intensive Care
Unit , the patient was afebrile with a pulse of 81 , blood pressure
108/74 , oxygen saturation of 84% on room air , and 97% on four
liters. JVP of 14 cm. Lungs with bibasilar rales. Cardiac exam
revealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft with a
pulsatile liver and mild right lower quadrant tenderness with no
rebound or guarding. His extremities had trace pitting edema.
Examination of his skin revealed vesicles at the sternum above
the nipple line with a papular rash extending in a dermatomal
pattern around to the right side of the back to the midline as
well as extension down the inner portion of his upper arm.
LABS: Labs were significant for a creatinine of 2.1 , and a
negative troponin on the day of admission.
IMPRESSION: 75-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy
admitted with ventricular fibrillation of unclear etiology ,
though possibilities include underlying infection or cardiac
ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was taken to the Cath Lab and
had stents placed in the LAD with other residual disease
remaining. The patient was continued on a regimen of aspirin ,
Plavix and a statin. The patient often refused to take the
statin , though this was recommended. He was also started on a
low dose of ace inhibitor which the patient frequently refused as
well. We would recommend starting a beta-blocker when the
patient is more stable. The patient continued to be diuresed
with Lasix until he was uvolemic and then resumed his home dose
of Lasix 80 mg daily. An echo during admission showed an EF of
15% with moderate aortic stenosis. For his episodes of
ventricular fibrillation , the patient was begun on an amiodarone
load with a goal of a total of 10 grams at which point he should
be tapered to 40 mg per day. He has one day remaining of his
amiodarone load and should begin the 400 mg per day dose on July , 2005. He was monitored on telemetry without significant
event. The patient should follow up with Dr. Kolopajlo in
Electrophysiology Clinic.
2. Infectious Disease: The patient was treated for both
community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with
cefotaxime , azithromycin and Flagyl. The patient completed a
5-day course of azithromycin. He is still in the process of
completing a total 10 day course of cephalosporin and Flagyl. He
has one more day of therapy remaining. The patient was also
noted to have shingles. The patient reports experiencing pain
that started on his back before the rash appeared. The rash was
present prior to admission. He was started on acyclovir on March , 2005 and this was stopped on June , 2005 given that there
was likely little utility of treatment begun greater than 48
hours into the course and because the patient preferred not to
take the medication.
3. Renal: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.5. Creatinine was initially elevated to
2.1 , but improved back to baseline prior to discharge.
4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes , but was on
no medications as an outpatient. He received a diabetic diet and
was treated with a regular insulin sliding scale during
admission. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 , indicating poor glycemic
control. He was started on a low dose of glipizide and the
regular insulin sliding scale was discontinued. The patient also
has a history of hypothyroidism. TSH was checked and was 1.6 ,
which is within normal limits. The patient was also noted to
have a low calcium level and was found to be vitamin D deficient.
We have started supplementation of vitamin D.
5. Heme: The patient is anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation
and low ejection fraction. The patient's Coumadin was initially
held but then restarted on March , 2005. He is now
therapeutic. Goal INR is 2-3. He will need to be monitored and
Coumadin adjusted as needed. The patient also has iron
deficiency anemia. He will need GI evaluation in the future. He
was begun on iron supplementation , however , the patient
frequently refuses to take this medication.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is therapeutic on Coumadin.
7. Code status: The patient is full code.
FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Blood draw in 2-3 days to monitor INR and creatinine. Please
adjust Coumadin dose for a goal INR of 2-3.
2. Taper amiodarone to 40 mg daily on July , 2005 from the
loading dose of 400 mg t.i.d.
3. Please encourage the patient to take simvastatin , captopril
and iron supplements. The patient frequently refuses to take
these recommended medications.
4. Last day of antibiotics is January , 2005.
5. The patient will need GI evaluation for his iron deficiency
anemia.
