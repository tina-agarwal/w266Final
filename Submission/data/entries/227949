HPI: The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history
of cardiac transplant and declining ventricular function is admitted
from Heart Failure Clinic after presenting for follow up eval and
noted to have new atrial fibrillation with VR of 130. Mrs. Kiyuna is

admission requiring IV diuresis and pressor support. She was

IMPRESSION:
Mrs Quander is a 33 F s/p cardiac transplant 1989 with allograft CAD
and declining ventricular function and on ionotropic support now with
new A Fib. Given tenuous function A Fib likely will be poorly
tolerated. PLAN:
1 )CV a. Isch - Cont. ASA , Statin , hydral and nitrate.
No evidence of active ischemia. b. Pump - Cont dobutamine at 2
MCG/KG/MIN. Cont PO torsamide c. Rhyth - On tele - with AF. Goal
to rate control , though underlying hypotention may be limiting. Will
start Heparin for anticoagulation with goal 50-70 PTT. EP consulted re:
rhythem control. Given past Amiodarone toxicity it is felt that
antiarhythmic therapy will likely not be of benifit. Will
anticoagulate and send out on coumadin. Will f/u with Dr. Sachse in
coumadin clinic.
2 ) Pulm - Will check CXR for pulm process as inciting cause. -&gt; negative
3 ) Renal - Baseline CRI. Will follow closely
4 ) ID - No issues
5 ) Rheum - H/O gout. Will cont allopurinol and Colchacine ( low dose )
6 ) GI - H/O esophagitis. NO IR KCL. Cont pepcid and nexium.
7 ) Immune - Cont Cellcept , prednisone and rapamycin. Will check
rapa level give past high levels. Will start transplant eval while in
house.
8 ) Heme - Heparin for new Afib. Goal 50-70. Will start coumadin
and get to goal INR of 2.0 prior to d/c..
9 ) Endo - Will check TSH -&gt; returned normal.
10 )Neuro/Psych - Cont clonapin 1 PRN
11 ) PPX - On heparin and PPI
12 ) FULL CODE
Discharged to home with services on dobutamine as before and on coumadin
for new PAF
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take all of your medications as prescribed. If there is a

atrial fibrilation. Blood draws to follow your INR will be
necessary. If you notice weight gain , increased lower extremity swelling
or increased SOB contact your cardiologist. If you have worsening
palpitations , chest pain , dizziness or lightheadedness please seek
medical attention.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
You will need blood draws starting 4/2/05 to measure your INR now that
you are taking coumadin. It is essential that the VNA service call in
the INR results to the DHMC Anticoagulation Clinic at 300-135-5841.
