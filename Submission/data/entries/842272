BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
***CC: chest pain in pt. w/ known CAD s/p CABG + PCI's
***HPI: Pt is a 74 yo male with h/o CAD s/p CABG 1998 ( lima-lad ,
svg-rca , svg-om1 , svg-diag1 ) with subsequent PCI to the svg-diag1
( 7/21 ) and the SVG-RCA ( 11/1 ) both with bare metal stents ,
CVA , HTN , DM. At baseline , he lives at home alone. He had been
reasonably active with ADLs and had been chest pain free for over 1 year.
On the night prior to admission , pt. experienced sharp substernal chest
pain 5/10 , non-radiating. He had no associated symptoms.
His CP improved w/ 2 NTGN. On the day of admission , he had
more episodes of stuttering chest pain relieved by nitroglycerin.
He presented to CHC for furthter evaluation and management.
Of note: The patient's last cardiac cathterization in 10/5
was unchanged compared to a 0/30 cath ( 3 of 4 grafts were patent. The
SVG-OM has a known 100% complex occlusion ). The pt.'s last ECHO in 0/30
showed an EF 30% with global hypokinesis and mild-mod MR.
***ED course: Afeb , HR 68 , BP 128/69 , O2sat 100%RA. Enzymes negative. EKG
with inferior TW flattening. CTA was negative for
dissection. Pt was treated w/ ASA , nitro SL ,
morphine 2mg x1 , and a heparin gtt with bolus.

RCA , and PLV. Patent LIMA to LAD.
Patent stented SVG to diag and SVG to RCA. Known occlusion of SVG to OM.
*ECHO: prelim EF 35-40%
***HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM and PROBLEM:
CV:
*CAD s/p CABG + stents to 2/4 grafts* Pt. presented with unstable angina.
He was treated w/ ASA , plavix , statin , tricor , bb , acei , and hep gtt.
He underwent cardiac cathterization as described above which revealed native
3vd , 3/4 patent grafts , and a new PLV occlusion which was stented.
Also had overlapping stent to distal RCA. Pt was treated w/ integrillin x 18
hours. He was discharged on his home cardiac ischemia regimen.
*dyslipidemia* Lipids were checked and were TC 117 , HDL 32 , LDL 54 , Tri 153.
LDL is in excellent range. HDL is still low despite tricor. One could
consider titrating up tricor on an outpt basis. LFTs and CKs would
require close monitoring.
*EF 30%* Pt. appeared euvolemic. He was continued on his home bb , acei ,
lasix and nitrate. A repeat ECHO was ordered , prelim shows EF 35-40%
*NSR*
NEURO: *CVA* Pt was continued on carbamazepine for tingling pain.
PULM: *h/o PE* Pt is no longer on coumadin. Ddimer in ED was positive.
CTA showed no central PE. No further imaging was pursued given
that clinical hx and exam not consistent w/ PE. Abnormal lab will
require outpt f/u. Issue of ongoing coumadin for h/o PE should
be readdressed on outpt basis.
GI: *GERD* Pt continued on PPI
*diverticulosis* Inactive
*dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts* Incidentally discovered on abdominal
imaging. WIll require outpt f/u and perhaps reimaging.
RENAL: *CRI* Cr improved from 1.6 on admission to 1.4 on discharge.
Pt received mucomyst and alkalinized fluid pre _+ post cath.
Ab imaging incidentally revealed L &gt;R perinephric stranding.
This is of an unclear etiology. Pt showed no clinical symptoms or signs of
kidney infection. Pt will require outpt f/u and perhaps repeat imaging
ONC: *nonspecific med LN , L hypodense kidney lesion* Incidental finding
on abdominal imaging. These will require outpt f/u and possibly repeat
imaging.
HEME: *anemia* Pt.'s hct ranged from 37 on admission to 33 on discharge.
He should have oupt f/u for anemia + possible colonoscopy.
ENDO: *DM* Pt.'s glipizide was held. He was treated with novolog while
hospitalized. He was discharged on his home glypizide.
PROPH: hep gtt/nexium
***DISCHARGE STATUS: Exam unchanged from admission save for new mild
bruising R groin. R LE warm w/ R pulses dopplerable. Labs w/ hct 33 , Cr 1.5
***DISPOSITION: Pt is being discharged to home without services. He should
follow up with his PCP and cardiologist.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: TO PT:
-You were admitted with chest pain. You were found to have a blockage
in one of the arteries around your heart and this blockage was preventing
your heart from getting enough oxygen. You underwent cardiac
catheterization and a stent was placed to keep this blocked artery open.
You should take all your medications and follow up with your doctors as
directed.
-Return to the emergency room or call your doctor if you have chest pain
or pressure , shortness of breath , palpitations , lightheadedness , nausea ,
vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , fevers , or any other concerning
symptoms.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
PCP/cards:
-F/u official read of ECHo
-f/u official read of CTA + ab/pelv CT
consider repeat imaging to eval abnormalities including nonspecific
mediastinal LN , mild dilation of intrahepatic bile duct , L&gt;R perinephric
stranding , and hypodense L kidney lesion
-Consider repeat ddimer ( abnormal here , but low prob for PE , no central
PE on CTA )
-Consider repeat lipase ( abnormal here , no clinical evidence of
pancreatitis )
-f/u anemia and consider colonoscopy
No dictated summary
