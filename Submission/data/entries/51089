following meals , esp fatty/caffeine meals , decreased PO intake , then
on day PTA with profound nausea , diaphoresis and SOB while ambulating.
EXTREMELY difficult by history to differentiate cardiac vs GI etiology.
On examination only tachycardic , no signs failure. Plan was to treat
as cardiac disease , and evaluate for GI cause. Pt's lopressor was dose
adjusted for tachycarida , continued on ASA , ACE , nitrates. Pt not
anticoagulated. Cardiology consult felt new symptoms were GI and did
not recommend in-house cardiac catherization. Pt was started on
increased dose of prilosec for presumed gastritis with no evidence of
GIB by hct and heme negative stools. Presumed cause was home asa and
prednisone use. Pt will consider outpatient cardiac catherization and
intervention. She is scheduled to see Dr. Kallam in 2 weeks and Dr.
