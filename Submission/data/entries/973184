inverted T's in I AVL , V4 , V5 , V6. Chest x-ray from 3/0/04
showed increased pulmonary vascular markings , otherwise clear.
Right ICA proximal 65-70% stenosis , left ICA proximal 75-80%
stenosis. The patient was admitted to our service and stabilized
for surgery. Date of surgery 4/15/04.
PREOPERATIVE STATUS: Urgent. The patient presented with AMI
critical coronary anatomy , rest angina , valve dysfunction.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: CAD , aortic stenosis.
PROCEDURE: An AVR with a 21 Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve
and a CABG x3 LIMA to LAD , SVG1 to PDA , SVG2-OM2 with a Robichek
closure. Bypass time 201 minutes , crossclamp time 156 minutes.
FINDINGS: Obesity , heart fused pericardium which had severe
calcification , adhesions between heart and pericardium taken down
on CPB. There are no complications. The patient was transferred
to the unit in stable fashion with lines and tubes intact.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Initial postoperative period: Rufus Leanard was
extubated without difficulty and had reasonable saturations on
nasal cannula. Chest x-ray appeared wet and diuresis was
increased. The history of COPD and thus preoperative COPD
medications were restarted. She was in sinus rhythm with a
systolic blood pressure of 110 and started on beta-blocker. She
was given Toradol initially for pain and Percocet for break
through pain. Gentle diuresis was initiated and in the initial
postoperative period she was on the Portland protocol for
elevated postoperative blood sugars. She was transferred to the
step-down unit on 9/2/04 where she continued to improve.
Diuresis was continued and increased as needed. She was on 96%
saturation with 3 liters of oxygen delivered via nasal cannula.
Her hematocrit postoperative fluctuated between 23-25 and the
patient was asymptomatic. She continued to be followed by
cardiology for the duration of her hospital course. Gentle
ambulation was increased. She remained in sinus rhythm in the
80's and pressure was stable 120's/80's and oxygen was
progressively weaned. Her temporary pacing wires were DC'd
without incident on 3/28/04. She was followed by Diabetes
Management Service for the duration of her hospital course.
Chest tubes were DC'd without incident on 7/12/04. Physical
therapy was consulted and they cleared her for home discharge
secondary to elevated white count and low-grade temperatures on
9/7/04. She was pan cultured. Resultant culture showed a UTI
and all cultures were negative. Wounds were stable. Diuresis
was continued and increased. Sid Loving had a postoperative
echocardiogram on 2/18/04 which showed an ejection fraction of
55-60% , trace MR , trace TR and no AI and no regional wall motion
abnormalities. She continued to progress well and was evaluated
by cardiac surgery service to be stable to discharge to home with
VNA service on 3/8/04 with the following discharge instructions.
Diet: Low-cholesterol low saturated fat , ADA 2100 calories per
day.
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS: With Dr. Feder 652 042-3264 in 5-6 weeks ,
Dr. Burkhead 364-329-0928 in 1-2 weeks , and Dr. Saltmarsh 262-598-9932
in 1-2 weeks.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please have PCP/cardiologist draw CBC at
first office visit and repeat UA and culture to determine need
for treatment of possible UTI , is completing antibiotic course as
outpatient.
TO DO PLAN: Make all follow up appointments. Local wound care:
Wash all wounds daily with soap and water. Watch all wounds for
signs of infection , redness , drainage , pain , swelling , fever.
