BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for elective
surgery on 4/18/06 with a preoperative diagnosis of
atherosclerotic coronary artery disease , tricuspid regurg , mitral
regurgitation , aortic stenosis. The patient underwent the
following procedures: Reop AVR ( 19 Carpentier-Edwards magna )/MVP
( commisuroplasty )/TVP ( annuloplasty-no ring )/CABG x1 ( SVG1 to
RCA ).
NOTABLE OPERATIVE DETAILS: Bypass time was 211 minutes.
Cross-clamp time of 152 minutes. Two atrial wires and one
ventricular wire were placed. One pericardial Blake drain was
placed. One retrosternal Blake drain was placed and one right
pleural tube Blake drain was placed. For full operative details ,
please refer to the operative note.
Immediately after transferring the patient to an ICU bed from the
OR table , the patient went into a VFib arrest. CPCR was briefly
performed until we could charge the external defibrillator. A
single shot of 125 joules lidocaine 60 mg resulted in sinus
rhythm and stabilization of hemodynamics. The patient was
transferred to the ICU for further postoperative care.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Neuro: The patient received sedation as required during
intubation. After extubation , the patient was weaned off all
sedating medications and is neurologically intact upon transfer
from the unit.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was externally paced initially
postoperatively with external pacing wires and then was
transferred back to internal pacing with previously placed
device. The patient was noted to be hypotensive on postoperative
day #1 and a levophed/epinephrine drip was initiated and
titrated for appropriate blood pressures. The patient was weaned
off pressors as tolerated and by postoperative day #3 was not
requiring any IV pharmacologic intervention with her blood pressure.
The patient was placed on Lopressor perioperatively and also
received IV amiodarone for previous arrhythmia. Upon transfer ,
patient is internally rate controlled with a rate of 90 beats per
minute and stable on a dose of Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.i.d. as
well as amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Respiratory: The patient was weaned to extubation on
postoperative day #1 without complication. The patient is
currently stable on 2 liters nasal cannula upon transfer from the
unit.
4. The patient received perioperative IV fluids for blood
pressure maintenance. These have been weaned to off by
postoperative day #3. The patient received electrolyte
replacement as indicated. The patient has begun on diuresis of
40 mg Lasix p.o. b.i.d. upon transfer from the unit. Of note ,
creatinine is 1.3 upon discharge from the ICU which is equal to
the patient's baseline creatinine.
5. GI: The patient's diet is advanced as tolerated after
extubation and was begun on Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.
6. Hematologic: The patient received blood transfusions as
indicated , which included 1 unit packed red blood cells on
postoperative day #1 for a hematocrit of 25 as well as 3 units of
packed blood cells on postoperative day #2. Platelet count was
noted to be below 50 on postoperative day #2 and a HIT panel was
sent which was negative x1. The patient has second HIT panel
pending upon discharge from the ICU. Platelets have been noted
to increase to 72 after nadir on postoperative day #2.
7 ID: The patient has had no issues and received appropriate
perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis vancomycin.
8. Endocrine: The patient's blood glucose was noted to be
greater than 150 postoperatively. The patient was placed on
sliding scale IV insulin per Portland protocol. The patient has
been weaned off IV insulin and discharged from the unit and is
receiving a NovoLog sliding scale as well as standing dosage of 6
units of Novolog q.a.c. The patient has been maintained on an
ADA diet.
9. Tubes , lines and drains: The patient had chest tube
discontinued on postoperative day #3 without complication.
External pacing wires were removed on postoperative day #4 prior
to transfer from the unit.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER FROM UNIT TO FLOOR:
1. Tylenol 325-650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. fever.
2. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
3. Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
5. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Synthroid 75 mcg p.o. daily.
