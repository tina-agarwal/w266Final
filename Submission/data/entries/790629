presents complaining of left arm and hand numbness with tingling
for twenty-four hours. The patient has a long history of coronary
artery disease starting with development of angina in 1989.
Ultimately , in 24 of June of 1991 , he underwent angioplasty of the lad which
re-stenosed. In 18 of February of 1992 , he had an myocardial infarction and
ultimately underwent a exercise tolerance test which was negative
and he was not catheterized and it was treated with Coumadin for
clot. In 6 of October of 1992 , he had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with
a peak CK of 231 , 6% MB. A catheterization at that time showed
100% LAD with right to left collateralization , an 80% circ and a
70% OM2. He under coronary artery bypass graft with a saphenous to
the OM1 and OM2 and a LIMA to the LAD. The coronary artery bypass
graft was complicated by ventricular fibrillation arrest and he did
have EPS done at that time. Two months later , an echocardiogram
showed an akinetic septum and akinetic apex and decreased left
ventricular function with an ejection fraction of about 40%. Since
his coronary artery bypass graft , the patient denies any chest
pain , shortness of breath or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He is
fairly active , walking a reasonable amount per day but has not yet
returned to work. Last evening after playing a video arcade game ,

left hand along the lateral side of the arm and a sense of
clumsiness with the left hand. He went to sleep but this feeling
persisted in the morning and he called the MH .  He was evaluated
there and sent for carotid noninvasives in the area which showed a
15% left and a 60% right ICA stenosis by report and was transferred
to the Naton Kanic Medical Center Emergency Room. In the
Emergency Room , he was thought to have proximal hand weakness and
upgoing toe on that same side and EKG changes so he was admitted.
Presently , the patient complains of decreased tingling in the hand
but still some numbness less so on the forearm. He denies
headache , nausea , vomiting or visual changes. PAST MEDICAL
HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is significant for
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease as
above , gout , proteinuria with 2.4 grams of protein in a 24-hour
urine in 1989 , morbid obesity. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

no palpable edema. The lungs were clear to auscultations. The
cardiac examination was unremarkable. The abdomen examination was
obese but had no masses or tenderness. He had trace lower
extremity edema , left greater than the right , consistent with
saphenous vein harvest site with good peripheral pulses. He was
guaiac negative on rectal exam. His neurological examination
showed alert and oriented times three. His cranial nerves were
intact. His discs were sharp bilaterally. He had a question of
mild pronator drift on the left. His strength was 5 out of 5
except for 4 out of 5 interossei on the left. He was able to do

43.9 , platelets of 245 , glucose 115 ,
BUN/creatinine 24/0.7 , EKG normal sinus at 70. He
pseudonormalization of T-waves in V2 through V6 , 1 and L. The
chest X-ray showed no acute changes. A CT of the head showed a
very vague and subtle area of decreased attenuation in the
posterior right frontal lobe. There was no mass effect or no
blood.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for presumed new stroke.
He was begun on Heparin and ultimately once the
