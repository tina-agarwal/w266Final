Discharge Date: 6/7/2006
ATTENDING: ENDERBY , HORACIO RILEY MD
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was diagnosed with coarctation of the
aorta in the early 1960s when he was told that he had a heart
murmur. At that time , he received no treatment and since the 1980's , has been
treated for hypertension , with blood pressures
unresponsive to medication. In 8/1 , the patient underwent
stenting of that coarctation and since then he has been followed
by serial echos. In the recent echo , he was noted to also have
progression of his aortic valve stenosis. The patient now
presents with marked limitation of his activities with some
complaint of the anginal type symptoms that wakes him one to two
times a week. The patient had a cardiac catheterization done on
9/4/06 , which showed a 70% mid circumflex and 70% proximal OM2 ,
and a 40% proximal LAD and patient is now referred for aortic
valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting.
The patient's past cardiovascular intervention , as stated above ,
stenting of the coarctation on 8/1 and status post two
cardiac catheterizations.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient's past medical history is significant for the
coarctation , aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease. The patient also has
history of hypertension , history of diabetes on both oral and
insulin therapy. The patient also has history of
hypercholesterolemia , glaucoma bilaterally with right cataract
that was repaired.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Inguinal hernia repair in 1994 , cataract surgery in 2004 ,
circumcision in 1995 and status post stenting of this coarctation
in 2002.

left arm 130/60 , on room air 96%. HEENT: PERRLA , dentition
without evidence of infection. No carotid bruit. Chest: No
incision. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm with grade
III murmur. Pulses: 2+ pulses throughout. Allen's test of the

Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Abdomen: No incision , soft , no
mass noted. Rectal: Deferred. Extremities: Without scarring ,
varicosity , or edema. Neuro: Alert and oriented with no focal
deficits.
LABORATORY DATA:
On admission , chemistries from 1/22/06: sodium of 143 , potassium
of 4 , chloride of 104 , CO2 of 29 , BUN of 9 , creatinine of 0.8 ,
glucose of 82 , and a magnesium of 1.8. Hematology from the same
day: white count of 12.7 , hematocrit of 43.3 , hemoglobin of 14.2 , platelets at
275 , 000 , PT of 13.2 , INR 1 , and a PTT of 29.9.
Cardiac catheterization done on 9/4/06 , coronary artery stenosis with a
70% mid circumflex , 70% proximal OM2 , and a 40% proximal LAD.
EKG on 9/4/06 normal sinus rhythm at 74. Chest x-ray reported
as normal from 10/25/06 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 1/30/06 and was taken to operating
room and underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21 St. Jude
Regent valve and an aortic root patch and a CABG x1 with the
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal #1. The patient's
total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 156 minutes , cross clamp
time was 220 minutes. The patient came off the heart lung
machine without any difficulty on no pressors and was taken up to
the Intensive Care Unit and extubated 14 hours postoperatively.
The patient's postoperative course by systems:
Neurologically:remained intact.
Cardiovascular: The patient initially was not on any pressors but for
pressure , required pacing and was started
on some dopamine as well as vasopressin , which was on until
postoperative day #3. By postoperative day #4 , patient was started on low-dose
beta-blockers , however , had some bradycardia and no further
beta-blockers were given throughout his postoperative stay. The
patient remained in normal sinus rhythm in the rates of 70s-80s on no
medication.
Respiratory: The patient was extubated 14 hours postoperatively
and was on Lasix for diuresis. He will be sent home on five more
days of Lasix at 20 mg p.o. daily. His discharge chest x-ray
shows minimal edema. No pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
GI: The patient was tolerating p.o. without any difficulty and
was on Nexium for GI prophylaxis. However , he had no prior history
of GERD or ulcer and will not be on any medications on discharge.
Renal: The patient had a stable BUN and creatinine throughout
his postoperative course and will be discharged with just 5
more days of Lasix 20 qd , with potassium replacement.
Endocrine: The patient was on oral and insulin ,
preoperatively and required an insulin drip intraoperatively and
closely followed by our Diabetes Service. The patient is
requiring a little bit more Lantus then he took preoperatively , as well as
some insulin with meals. The patient should follow his
fingersticks as he was preoperatively and follow up with his PCP
for his diabetric management.
Heme: The patient is on Coumadin for his
mechanical aortic valve. However , his INR on day of discharge was still
not therapeutic with an INR of 1.4. The decision was made for the patient to be
able to be discharged to home with a Lovenox bridge. He will be sent
home with 120 mg of Lovenox until his INR is greater than 2. A
phone call was placed through the Naplesgea Hospital .  They will follow
closely due to the lovenox bridge then will also follow his coumadin dosing.
The patient is also on baby aspirin for his coronary artery
disease. The patient had a stable hematocrit with a discharge
hematocrit of 26 and INR stated above of 1.4.
The patient is otherwise in stable condition. A decision was made that the
patient to be discharged to home on postoperative day #8.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
He will be discharged on these following medications:
