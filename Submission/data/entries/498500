The patient is a 64-year-old with known CAD , atherosclerotic peripheral
vascular disease , and type 2 diabetes presented with back pain. She
describes a sudden onset of 8/10 stabbing back pain 4 days ago without
a clear precipitant. The pain was non raditating and partially releived
with analgesics.She denied any bowel or bladder incontinence or saddle
anesthes ia. She denied any fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , or
diarrhea. She does however complain of some urinary frequency ( on
lasix ) in the last few days with out any dysuria or urgency. Of note
over the past month she has had increasing had shortness of breath
however she denies any orthopnea or PND. The patient has long standing
pedal edema and has increasing abdominal distension over the last month
but has not noticed any change in her weight. The patient has CAD and
her angina equivalent is jaw pain.However in the last 6 months she has
had intermittent left sided chest pain that radiates to her left arm.

norm al LFTs. She was admitted with a diagnosis of pancreatitis.

admission to 200 , fell to 60 with NPO and IVF. However , MRA read with
radiology 2/11 shows diffuse atherosclerotic disease including
stenosis of celiac artery , vascular surgery was consulted for concer
about mesenteric ischemia. They do not think she is having symptoms of
ischemia , would like abdominal MRA to further assess abdominal
vasculature. Triglycerides very high , could be cause of her
pancreatitis , starting gemfibrozil. LDL was 151.
