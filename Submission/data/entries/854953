ATTENDING: KEPPEL , LONG M.D.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Mechanical fall.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Mechanical fall.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension.
2. Bradycardia.
3. Osteoarthritis , status post left total knee replacement.
4. Spinal stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Navarrate is a 73-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
dyslipidemia , and arthritis who presents with a fall. The
patient has a history of pulmonary embolism in 2000 , treated with
Lovenox and Coumadin. The patient also has a history of coronary
artery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction. She presented with chest pain in 2001 and had a
troponin I , which peaked at 25. Cardiac catheterization revealed
a left-sided occlusion and percutaneous coronary intervention was
unsuccessful. A subsequent adenosine mibi in July 2002
revealed normal left ventricular function and no perfusion
defects. The patient has since been admitted for left chest
pain , last in February 2005 , which has been attributed to her
shoulder arthritis. She ruled out for myocardial infarction at
that time and chest CT scans were also negative. Today , the
patient was talking to her son on the phone when she went to
retrieve a pen and her left knee gave out and she suffered a
mechanical fall to the floor. She struck her left forehead
against a dresser. She did not have any loss of consciousness
and also denied chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations.
There were no focal neurological deficits and no actively
inflamed joints. She says that her left lower extremity ,
especially her left knee is chronically unstable and weak. In
the emergency department , the patient was afebrile. Her heart
rate was 70. Her systolic blood pressure was initially 190 mmHg ,
but subsequently came down to 150 mmHg without any intervention.
A head CT was negative for bleed and a chest x-ray was negative
for infiltrate or effusions. She was admitted to Medicine for
further evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease , hypertension ,
hypercholesterolemia , osteoarthritis , polyarthritis with positive
rheumatoid factor , and a positive ANA , spinal stenosis , pulmonary
embolism in 2001 , obesity , pseudogout , status post left total
knee replacement , history of right foot cellulitis ,
gastroesophageal reflux disease , and history of colonic adenomas.
ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to Bactrim and shellfish.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include aspirin 325 mg , atenolol 25
mg , Plaquenil 400 mg daily , lisinopril 60 mg daily , nifedipine 90
mg daily , meloxicam 7.5 mg daily , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg
daily , Lipitor 40 mg daily , Protonix 40 mg daily , and Colace 100
mg p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient's temperature was 96.2
degrees , heart rate was 52 beats per minute , blood pressure was
142/70 , respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute , and the
patient's oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. On physical
exam , the patient was lying in bed in no apparent distress and
was alert and oriented. The extraocular movements were intact.
There is no scleral icterus with a mild proptosis and some
periorbital induration around her right eye , which was tender to
palpation. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. The
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. On her cardiac
exam , the patient had a regular rate and rhythm , a normal S1 with
physiological split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur , best heard at
the base. Abdomen was soft and nontender , with active bowel
sounds. The patient's extremities were warm and well perfused
without edema. On strength testing , the patient had 4/5 strength
in her left knee extensors and left hip flexors; otherwise , all
other muscle groups in her lower extremities were 5/5. The
patient reports that her left lower extremity weakness is
chronic. There were no effusions on either knee. Skin was
without rashes.
INITIAL LABORATORY DATA: Her sodium was 143 , potassium 3.4 ,
chloride 107 , bicarb 28 , BUN 16 , creatinine 0.9 , with glucose of
160. The patient had a white blood cell count of 5300 ,
hematocrit was 35.7 , and platelets were 217 , 000. Her INR was 0.9
and a PTT was 27.8. The patient's initial CK was 177 , CK-MB was
3.7 , and troponin I was less than assay. An EKG showed sinus
bradycardia with normal axes and no T-wave changes , no Q waves ,
and no ST changes. Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary
process and a head CT was negative for mass or bleed.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted due to a mechanical
fall and ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial CKs and
troponins drawn 8 hours apart for three sets. Her EKGs remained
unchanged throughout her hospitalization and the patient had no
chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other cardiac symptoms.
Her troponin values were all less than assay. The patient
ambulated with PT the morning after her admission without
difficulty , navigating stairs , and also walking around the pond
without any difficulty whatsoever. The patient also had plain
films taken of her left knee , which showed that her left knee
prosthesis was well seated without any evidence of instability or
fusion or fracture of the joint. The patient was noted during
her hospitalization to be bradycardiac to the mid 40s while
sleeping. It was recommended that the patient follow up with the
primary care physician to assess whether she needs to continue on
her atenolol due to bradycardia noted on telemetry. The patient
will also follow up with her orthopedist regarding her proceed
instability of her left knee joint. The patient's orthopedist is
Dr. Fickett of the Pa Memorial Hospital and her primary care
physician is Dr. Mcbrearty in Vill Medical Center The patient will call
for follow-up appointment with her physicians. The patient was
discharged with her son to home on the evening of 0/9/06 to
continue her admission medications. There were no changes made
to her medications listed above.
