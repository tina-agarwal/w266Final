DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: IDIOPATHIC HYPERTROPHY SUBAORTIC STENOSIS.
RELATED DIAGNOSES: 1 ) INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS.
2 ) SYNCOPE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 79 year old Russian
speaking female who had had a history
of exertional chest pain and no previous documented coronary artery
disease. In August 1995 , patient was admitted to Penle Hospital for symptomatic bradycardia. She ruled out for a
myocardial infarction at that time. Echocardiogram revealed left
ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular cavity obstruction
with systolic outflow tract gradient of 20-30 mm of mercury. In
July 1995 , patient presented to the Sumri Sondoyle Hospital with complaints
of exertional chest pain with onset after one flight of stairs.
She was started on Atenolol. Echocardiogram at that time revealed
asymmetric septal hypertrophy , anterior movement of mitral valve
during systole , and peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient of
58 mm of mercury. This was consistent with the diagnosis of
idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Patient was continued
on Atenolol , however , given her history of symptomatic bradycardia ,
her dose could not be increased. One week prior to admission , the
patient noted onset of substernal chest pressure described as pain
in her anterior chest radiating to her jaw. This was usually
experienced in the late morning with no obvious relation to
exertion usually accompanied by light headedness. On the day of
admission , patient awoke without pain , however , in the a.m. , she
again noted onset of substernal chest pressure associated with
light headedness. This lasted for a period of about thirty minutes
after which time she had a syncopal event. The patient fell on her
right hip without evidence of head trauma with brief loss of
consciousness. Within seconds , she was awake and conversant. EMT
was alerted and she was brought to Rit Hospital
Emergency Department for further evaluation and management. She
denied any significant shortness of breath , fever , chills , and
sweats.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Insulin dependent diabetes times
twenty years , status post
pancreatectomy , IHSS , and angina.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. , Nifedipine XL 30 mg
p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
aspirin , and 30 units NPH insulin q.a.m.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of IHSS or sudden death
documented.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient was originally from the Ist. Andfreca , former
teacher , married , and lived with husband. There
was no significant use of alcohol or tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , patient was a pleasant elderly
female in no acute distress. She was
afebrile with a heart rate of 64 , blood pressure 114/68 ,
respiratory rate 16 , and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. HEENT:
Examination was notable for anisocoria , right pupil status post
previous surgery , and oropharynx clear without lesions. NECK:
Supple without lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention ,
carotids were without bruits , and firm mobile mass on anterior
neck. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Regular
rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , and III/VI late systolic murmur best heard
at the left lower sternal border. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES:
Without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination
was non-focal.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: CBC showed a hematocrit of 43.1 , white
blood count 8.6 , platelets 160 ,
electrolytes within normal limits with a potassium of 4.7 ,
BUN/creatinine 34/0.9 , liver function tests within normal limits ,
INR 1.1 , and CK 68. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.006 ,
pH 5.5 , and 1+ bacteria , chest x-ray with evidence of tortuous
aorta but no acute pulmonary or cardiac disease , and ECG showed a
sinus rhythm , left ventricular hypertrophy , early repolarization in
V1 to V3 , T wave inversion in lead I , first degree AV block ,
otherwise with normal intervals , and axis minus 39.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 79 year old female with a history of
IHSS and insulin dependent diabetes who now
presented with a syncopal episode accompanied by substernal chest
pressure. Given the patient's history of chest pain , she was ruled
out for myocardial infarction with flat CK and cardiac troponin I
of 0.0. She was placed on cardiac monitor. She was noted to have
normal sinus rhythm at a rate in the fifties to sixties increasing
as high as the nineties with exertion. As a result , the patient's
beta blocker dose was increased as tolerated with close monitoring
for possible bradycardia. Given the likelihood that her symptoms
could be related to decreased outflow secondary to IHSS , the
Pacemaker Service was consulted. It was felt that the patient
would benefit from placement of a permanent pacemaker which would
possibly be therapeutic both for IHSS as well as allowing further
titration of beta blocker for her exertional angina. The procedure
was discussed with the patient and her family in detail and her
family requested one additional evening to discuss whether or not
to proceed with pacemaker placement. She remained on cardiac
monitor and remained asymptomatic throughout her hospital course.
Clinically , the patient remained stable. She remained on cardiac
monitor given her history of daily episodes of syncope and chest
pain over the last week prior to admission. Her blood sugar was
followed closely with fingersticks q.i.d. and she was replaced with
sliding scale Regular insulin in addition to her regular NPH dose.
On 4/18/96 , the patient underwent placement of a permanent
pacemaker , mode DDDR , via her left axillary vein without
complication. The patient remained stable overnight and placement
of pacemaker was confirmed with chest x-ray.
DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home in stable condition.
She was instructed to notify her medical doctor for
any worsening of chest pain , light headedness , or pain at the
pacemaker site. In addition , she was instructed to check the
incision site for sign of redness as well as fever and she was told
not to shower for four days status post pacemaker placement.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg
p.o. q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. , and
Procardia XL 30 mg p.o. q.d. She will resume her previous insulin
dosing.
FOLLOW-UP: Patient will follow-up with her primary medical doctor ,
Dr. Retort , and her Cardiologist , Dr. Shorty She will
follow-up , in addition , with Dr. Orris in the Pacemaker Clinic in
approximately one month.
