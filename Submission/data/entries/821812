steroids. On the following day , she had mildly decreased wheezing.
Her peak flow had increased to 200. She was changed to oral
steroids. She continued to improve slowly with slow improvement in
her peak flow. Her steroid taper was begun early given the past
history of paranoia with steroids. She felt that the Bactrim gave
her cramping and therefore this was discontinued as it was felt
highly unlikely that she had a bacterial infection and much more
likely that she had a viral upper respiratory infection disposing
her to her asthma exacerbation. She slowly continued to improve
and was discharged to home to complete a steroid taper. She had no
episodes of chest pain or other difficulties while in the hospital.
