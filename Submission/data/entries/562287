The pain radiated to both arms , left greater than right , jaw and
was associated with shortness of breath , nausea , and sweats. He
presented to the emergency room at the outside hospital and had
an EKG two hours later showing marked ST elevations in V2 and V3 ,
1 aVL and was reciprocal ST depressions inferiorly. The patient
was treated with aspirin , heparin , Plavix , and sublingual
nitroglycerin , Lopressor , Integrilin and was transferred to the
Ettecile Valley Hospital for an emergent PCI.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for type 2 diabetes controlled only with oral
hypoglycemics ( glyburide ) , anxiety.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
The patient was alert and oriented and in moderate amount of
distress secondary to anxiety following his cath. Vital Signs:
He had a temp of 100.2 , his blood pressure was 120/79 , and his
heart rate was 96 beats per minute. He was satting at 96% on 2 L
of nasal cannula. HEENT: His JVP was at 9 cm , he had 2+ carotids
without bruits. His extraocular motions were intact. His pupils
were equal , round , and reactive to light. His cardiac exam was
significant for regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , and an S4.
There were no murmurs. His lungs had decreased breath sounds on
the lower right base with crackles about one-third of the way up
on that side. His left lung was clear. His abdomen was soft ,
nontender , and nondistended. Bowel sounds were present.
Extremities: He had 2+ pedal pulses. There was no pitting edema.
Skin: Noted to be hypopigmented , the patient has a history of
albinism. Of note , one additional comment about his HEENT exam ,
the patient is legally blind. He is able to see most objects at
about 6 or 7 feet away from him.
His chest x-ray showed a right middle opacification concerning
for an infiltrative pneumonia. His EKG on admission post cath
showed a rate of 98 , sinus rhythm , and ST elevations 2 mm in V2
through V3 and ST depressions in leads II , III , and aVF. Labs on
admission were significant for creatinine of 1.4 up from a
baseline of 1.2. His cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 178 and MB
of 3.7 and troponin of less than assay. His CBC was normal.
There was no left shift. His UA was significant for a specific
gravity of 1.086 , 1+ protein , 3+ glucose , 2+ ketones , 2+ blood ,
1-3 white blood cells , 2-4 red blood cells , and trace bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. CV: Ischemia. An emergent cath on admission on 10/24/04
showed two-vessel disease and 100% LAD , osteal lesion , and a 90%
marginal 1 lesion. The LAD was stented with a 3.5 x 8 mm and a
3.0 x 13 mm and a 3.0 x 18 mm Cipher stents all to 0%. The
marginal 1 was not stented during this cath. The patient's CK
peaked at 10 , 438 , and a CK-MB at 452 and his troponin at 721.
The patient was transferred to the CCU after his cath. He was
treated with aspirin , Plavix , Lopressor , captopril , Integrilin
x12 hours. The patient recovered well except for his heart rate
remained in tachycardiac at 90 to 110 range despite Lopressor
which was increased to 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. With the setting of
tachycardia , he developed ST elevation in 1 aVL with ST
depressions and 3 aVF in the evening of 4/4/04 , although his
cardiac enzymes continued to turn down. The patient underwent a
second cath on 5/24/04 , which showed that all his stents placed
in his LAD previously remained patent. The marginal 1 was
stented at this time with Cipher stent 0. The patient was doing
very well after his second procedure. His heart rate remained
slightly tachycardiac , the patient experienced no further EKG
changes.
2. Pump: The patient was on Lopressor and captopril , and his
blood pressure remained stable after his procedures. Echo on
5/8/04 showed an LVEF of 30% as well as akinesis of the mid
distal anterior wall felt in the entire apex. There was
hypokinesis of the basal anterior septum and the basal to mid
lateral wall with preserved function of the basal to mid inferior
and posterior wall. The apex is near aneurysmal. The patient
was put on heparin GTT given the risk of intraventricular
thrombus. The patient was started on Coumadin prior to
discharge.
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient remained mildly tachycardiac.
His Lopressor was titrated up to 100 mg q.i.d. for rate control
but no concerning arrhythmias were noted on telemetry. His sinus
tachycardia was thought to be secondary to a bacterial pneumonia.
4. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes. The hemoglobin
A1c was 10.57 demonstrating the patient's conservative treatment
was insufficient. He was started on NPH and insulin sliding
scale in the hospital. Metformin was started on 11/6/04 , and he
was restarted on Glucotrol before discharge. Diabetic teaching
was instituted.
5. Renal: Mucomyst was given before and after both of his
caths. His creatinine turned into his baseline of 1.2.
6. Heme: The patient was sent home on Coumadin given his
echocardiogram significant for near aneurysmal LV and a
hypokinetic apex. The patient will need to be followed in
Coumadin Clinic. Code status for this patient remained full
throughout his hospitalization.
7. Pulmonary: The patient was noted to be febrile and to have a
right middle lobe infiltrate on admission. The patient was
treated with five days of levofloxacin but remained febrile and
tachycardiac. The patient was started on azithromycin for a
total of five-day course. The patient defervesced after 24 hours
of being on azithromycin. Also of note , on a follow-up chest
x-ray prior to discharge , was read as the patient having a
question of a cavitating lesion in his right lobe. It was
recommended that this be followed up as an outpatient.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was discharged on following medications.
Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 one tab sublingual q.5 minutes x2
doses p.r.n. for chest pain , azithromycin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x4
doses , simvastatin 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , metformin 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , Nexium 40 mg p.o. q.d. ,
lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d. , Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. , and
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.p.m.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
1. The patient was instructed to call his cardiologist and
primary care doctor , Dr. Budd , within one to two days of
discharge. Dr. Osendorf is expecting the patient's call.
2. The patient is scheduled to go to the Coumadin Clinic at the
Opa Health within five days of discharge. Dr.
Callaway number of ( 718 ) 086-2629 was provided to the
patient and as well as the phone number for the Coumadin Clinic
at Tysco Oolwe Medical Center .
THINGS TO DO AT DISCHARGE:
1. Follow up with Dr. Romm regarding a cardiac regimen.
2. Follow up with Dr. Apple regarding your blood sugar
control and possibly being started on insulin.
3. Follow up with Dr. Mahr regarding the question of a
