past that resulted in hives. THe patient has
questionable allergy to an unknown antibiotic which causes a rash.

b.i.d. , Cardizem 180 q d , Lasix 40 q d , Insulin 70/30

FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's father died of MI at age 81; mother
died of MI at age 73. The patient has a brother
who died of MI at age 38.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is comfortable in no acute
distress. It is noted that the patient is
morbidly obese. Vital signs; Pulse 120 , blood pressure 180/80 ,
temperature 99.5 , respiratory rate 16 , O2 sats 96% at room air.
HEENT: Pupils are equal , round and reactive to light; Extraocular
muscles are intact. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are
moist. NECK: Supple without lymphadenopathy. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 ,
S2 no murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. The patient has
diminished dorsalis pedis pulse on the left side; otherwise ,
peripheral pulses are intact. CHEST: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally; crackles bilaterally at the bases. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
soft , non-tender. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing , cyanosis or edema
noted. There is a 1 cm abrasion at the right shin , bruising over
the right shin and dorsal aspect of the foot. NEURO: Alert and
oriented times three. There is a right lower facial droop;
otherwise cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor is 5/5 in
all extremities; sensory is intact throughout to light touch.
LABORATORY: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 100 , bicarb 26 ,
BUN 16 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 305. WBC 12.7 ,
hematocrit 36.1 , platelets 327. Troponin I is 0; CK 216. Chest
x-ray is negative. CT of head is negative. EKG shows normal sinus
rhythm at rate of 117. There is a right bundle branch block and
left anterior fascicular block present. There are also Q waves in
lateral leads V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the general medical
service for evaluation of syncope. She was
monitored over the weekend and no arrhythmias were picked up on
cardiac monitor. The patient underwent echocardiography which
showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of
80%. There were no wall motion abnormalities. There was also noted
mild left atrial enlargement and mild aortic valve sclerosis. Due
to the worrisome nature of patient's history of angina-like
symptoms , she went directly to cardiac catheterization , which
revealed heavily calcified LAD and RCA. The LAD showed proximal
stenosis of 30 to 40% , circumflex showed proximal stenosis of 30%
and the RCA showed proximal stenosis of 30%. It was felt that this
represented mild CAD and most likely could not explain the source
of the patient's syncopal episode. The patient also underwent
electrophysiology study which showed no evidence for ventricular
arrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias as cause of syncope. The patient
continued to have no arrhythmic events on cardiac monitor
throughout her hospital stay. The patient tolerated the cardiac
cath well and did well during the postprocedure period. The
patient's diltiazem was discontinued thinking that it may
contribute to heart block given the fact that she has a
bifascicular block. THe patient was started on nifedipine XL. The
patient was discharged home with close follow-up with her primary
care physician , Dr. Mendoca .
MEDICATIONS: On discharge , Captopril 75 b.i.d. , Nifedipine XL 90 q
