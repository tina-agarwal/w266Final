HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS and PROBLEMS:
RENAL: *worsening renal insufficiency* Pt was admitted with worsening
renal insufficiency. A UA was dirty and urine culture was sent.
Pt was not treated with antibiotics , as she was afebrile , asymptomatic ,
and without leukocytosis. Her FeBun was 35.9 , not consistent with
intravascular depletion. On exam , she appeared euvolemic.
A repeat ECHO revealed relatively unchanged systolic function.
A renal ultrasound was within normal limits. It is unclear what
caused the patient's vacillation in renal function. She likely has
a narrow range with respect to ideal volume status. She was continued on her
home torsemide dose while in house. Her weight on discharge was 72.5 kg ( 159
lbs ) , very close to her admission weight of 72.7 kg and to her designated dry
weight of 159 lbs. Her creatinine improved on its own from 2.7 on admission
to 1.9 on the day of discharge. 1.9 represents a value within her
baselne creatinine range of 1.8 to 2.2. She will need close follow up of
her renal function
*hyperkalemia* Pt presented with hyperkalemia in setting of worsening renal
insufficiency. Her peak creatinine was 5.5. She recevied kayex on the day of
admission. Subsequent creatinine measurements were in the 4's without
k-binding treatment on the one hand or K supplementation on the other.
Pt. had been on k supplementation at home. Her oral supplements are being
held on discharge. She will need close follow up of her potassium and
may need to resume supplementation on an outpatient basis.
CV:
*CAD s/p multiple PCI* Pt was continued on ASA , bb , statin. She was
also started on low dose isordil. Her BP will need close monitoring on this
new medication.
*BP* Pt was continued on bb and started on isordil , as above.
On the day of discharge , her standing SBP dropped to 92 from 118 sitting.
Her HR remained in the 70s. She was asymptomatic. In light of these changes ,
she was discharged on torsemide 40 mg PO bid , lower than her home dose and
in-hospital dose of 60 mg pO bid. She was instructed not to walk without
supervision and to stand up slowly from seated position.
*CHF* Pt was thought to be clinically euvolemic on exam. Her BNP was in the
800s. Her repeat ECHo showed an EF of 30% , relatively unchanged from
previous ECHO 1/13 She was continued on her home torsemide dose while in
house and discharged on a lower dose of torsemide as described above.
*MVR* Stable.
*afib* Pt was rate controlled with bb. Her INR was subtherapeutic on
admission. In light of this , her coumadin dose was increased from 1 to 2
while in house. Her INR rose to 1.9 on discharge. Her coumadin dose was
downgraded to 1. She will need close follow up of her INR.
HEME:
*iron deficiency anemia* Pt. was continued on iron. Colonoscopy could
be considered but may not be indicated given pt.'s prognosis from known
lung malignancy.
ONC:
*lung CA* Pt has CXR findings likely related to her known
malignancy. She will f/u with her outpatient oncologist.
PULM:
*o2 requirement* Pt was noted to desat to 87% while ambulating.
Home O2 was arranged. Etiology of pt.'s new oxygen requirement likely
relates to underlying lung malignancy , and perhaps to her CHF - although
she appears compensated from that standpoint.
ENDO: *DM* Pt was treated with SSI while in house and was discharged on
her home glipizide. She was continued on her home levoxyl.
RHEUM: *gout* Pt was continued on her prophylactic allopurinol.
PROPH: nexium/coumadin
****DISCHARGE STATUS: On discharge , pt. is afebrile , P 70s SBP 90s-110s
satting 95% 2L. Exam unchanged from admission. hct 31 , Cr 1.9 , INR 1.9
****DISPOSITION: Pt is being discharged to home with VNA services
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: TO PT:
-You were admitted with worsening kidney function. An ultrasound of your
kidneys was normal and your kidney function improved.
-During this hospitalization , we added a new medication called isordil 5
mg three times per day. We decreased your dose of torsemide to 40 mg
two times per day. In addition , we stopped your medication
called potassium. You will have your potassium levels checked and your
outpatient physicians will decide on whether you need to restart potassium
and at what level.
-We arranged for you to have home oxygen. Use it while sleeping and
when you feel short of breath. Do not smoke or cook on the stove while
using oxygen. Stay away from open flames.
-Do not stand up quickly from a seated position and do not
walk without supervision. We noticed your blood pressure is lower
when you stand and we do not want you to get dizzy and fall , especially as
you are on coumadin. Do not drive.
-Return to the emergency room or call your doctor if you have increasing
shortness of breath , weight gain , chest pressure or jaw pain , dizziness ,
lightheadedness , palpitations , abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea.
-Take prescription for blood draw to HHO on 7/21 Have INR , chem 7 , and
magnesium checked. As per script , results should be faxed both to Dr. Sterling Guandique fax 563-462-7452 and to Dr. Jospeh Olaya tel 724-105-6354
To VNA:
-monitor O2 sat on home O2
- do heart rate and blood pressure check
- check weight - notify Dr. Robert Avenoso 724-105-6354 if weight
increases or decreases by 2 pounds in 3 days
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Fair
TO DO/PLAN:
PCP/cards:
-Monitor creatinine. Pt.'s creatinine improved from 2.7 to 1.9. Baseline
1.8-2.2 in past. FeBUN was 35.9% and BUN/Cr ratio was 20. We continued
torsemide 60mg po bid. Renal ultrasound was normal bilaterally.
-Monitor potassium. Pt.'s K decreased from 5.5 to 4.1. She did not
require potassium supplementation while in the hospital. Her outpatient
dose of potassium was held. This may need to be restarted if her potassium
decreases below 4.
-F/u official results of urine culture , send secondary to dirty UA.
Pt not treated as afebrile , asymptomatic , nl wbc count.
-Monitor hct - stable in low 30s. Pt has known iron deficiency anemia
and is on iron.
-Monitor INR on coumadin. Goal INR is 2-3. Pt had been on 1 mg PO qd
coumadin at home. Her INR on admission was 1.5. She was treated with
coumadin 2 mg PO qd. Her INR rose to 1.9 on the day of discharge. She was
discharged again on coumadin 1 mg PO qd. VNA should draw her INR on 8/8
and fax results to her PCP.
-Monitor blood pressure on isordil. On low dose 5mg po tid currently.
-Monitor SOB on home o2. Pt. desatted to 87% while ambulating on RA. Her
subjective shortness of breath improves tremendously on 2L. PET scan
suggests progressive lung CA.
-Patient is DNR/DNI and her healthcare proxy is her husband.
