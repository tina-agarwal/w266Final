Discharge Date: 7/8/2006
ATTENDING: SECKMAN , JEREMIAH M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Shortness of breath and jaw discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Harpst is a 71-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial flutter who
started to develop shortness of breath , which worsened the night
prior to admission. This is consistent with her previous
sensation that she gets when her heart rate increases with atrial
flutter. She also noted some jaw soreness , which she commonly
feels with increased heart rate. At the time , she was seen in the
hospital , she was asymptomatic. She also gets some pain under
her breasts bilaterally when her heart rate increased. She
denies any orthopnea and no leg swelling or PND. Her exercise is
limited by claudication , which worsens in cold weather. Also
when she gets up quickly , she continues to feel lightheaded but
no loss of consciousness. She is steady on her feet.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever , some nausea today , no vomiting , and
little bit of diarrhea for one week but nonbloody. She has a
history of colitis. No dysuria. No hematuria. No new joint
pains.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for hypertension , sick sinus
syndrome with bradycardia status post a pacemaker placement in
1986. She has had high cholesterol. She has coronary artery
disease status post an MI in 1992 , a CABG in 1992 , LIMA to LAD ,
SVG to PDA. She has also had PCI x2. She has peripheral
vascular disease. She is status post angioplasty. She has
diabetes , status post cholecystectomy , status post pelvic floor
suspension x2 , status post appendectomy and status post lysis of
adhesions for bowel obstruction and colitis.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Digoxin 0.125 mg daily , lisinopril 5
mg daily , Pravachol 20 mg each night , diltiazem XR 360 mg daily ,
Plavix 75 mg daily , Asacol 1200 mg twice daily , cilostazol 50 mg
twice daily , Toprol-XL 300 mg daily , Coumadin 2 mg daily ,
metformin 500 mg twice daily , nitroglycerin , lorazepam 0.25 mg in
the morning and midday and then 0.5 mg at night , she does not
take aspirin.
ALLERGIES: She has allergies to sulfa , which cause a rash ,
penicillin causes angioedema , tetracycline , and H2
blockers.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. She has a 40+ pack
year of smoking , quit in 1986. No drinking currently but has in
the past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , temperature 96.1 , pulse 82 ,
blood pressure 130/60 , respiratory rate 24 and saturating 92% on
3 liters. General: She is in no acute distress , appears stated
age. HEENT: She is anisocoria , left greater than right ,
reactive to light. Neck is supple. JVP is 6 cm.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. Respiratory: She has crackles at the
bases. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds , soft , nontender , and
nondistended. Extremities: Warm and dry , no edema , and 1+
distal pulses. She is alert and oriented x3.
Her EKG shows V pacing with underlined flutter. Labs were
notable for a creatinine of 0.8 , and a hematocrit of 29.2. CK
and troponins were negative. Studies performed during her
admission , chest x-ray showed atelectasis. An echo prior to
admission showed mildly reduced EF , hypokinetic septum , LAE ,
dilated RA , and normal AR , 3+ MR , trace PR. A MIBI performed
during this admission showed moderate aortic ischemia in the
anterior wall and in the diagonal territory. Chest x-ray on
0/21/2006 , later on admission showed improved pulmonary edema ,
slightly increased size of small effusions , and no infiltrate.
She had a TEE , which showed no clot and a mild-to-moderate
decreased EF. She had a TTE with bubble study on 2/22/2006 ,
which showed no shunt , and an EF of 45%. She had PFTs , which
showed a mixed restrictive and obstructive picture that was
mild-to-moderate in severity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Cardiovascular:
1. Rhythm: Ms. Prestage has a long history of atrial flutter ,
which has been poorly controlled despite extremely high doses of
beta-blockers , diltiazem , and digoxin. She underwent a TEE and
DC cardioversion and remained out of atrial flutter , and V paced
at 60 beats per minute for remainder of her admission.
2. Ischemia: She has a significant history of coronary artery
disease. After her DC cardioversion , she continued to complain
of shortness of breath and was found to be hypoxic on room air
which we discussed below. She did have the positive MIBI as
discussed above , but given her significant previous
interventions , the thought was to continue to manage her
medically since this would not likely be amenable to intervention.
3. Pump: In 2002 , she had an EF of 45 to 55%. She was not on
any signs of decompensated CHF , although her shortness of breath
did improve marginally with some gentle diuresis. A repeat TTE
on 2/22/2006 showed an EF of 45% , which was relatively unchanged
from 2002.
Respiratory: Status post her cardioversion , she was found to be
saturating in the mid 80s on room air and desaturating further on
ambulation. Pulmonary was consulted and a room air ABG was
obtained that showed pH 7.48 , pCO2 33 , and pO2 52. She had no
evidence of carbon monoxide , no methemoglobinemia. Her PFTs were
as described above. With a gentle diuresis and with more
ambulation , she improved. It is unclear why she had this transient
hypoxemia. Pulmonary recommended a trial of Advair and Spiriva ,
if these made her feel better to continue these , if not then she
could stop them. Also mentioned , she underwent a bubble study
which showed no shunt. In sum , there was a question as to whether this may be
related to atelectasis plus some underlying
COPD plus her underlying small effusion. She was scheduled to
follow up with pulmonary clinic after discharge.
Peripheral vascular disease: She has been improved since three
years ago and she had a peripheral PCI. She was stable on
cilostazol.
Heme: On Coumadin for her atrial flutter.
Endo. We held her oral anticoagulants and her oral agents while
she was inhouse and insulin sliding scale was restarted metformin
on discharge.
Ms. Chafin was discharged to home with a plan to have her INR
checked as usual with Dr. Majica office and to have follow up
PFTs at her followup appointment with the In Bingenu Na Plama Leah on 4/14/2006 at 3 p.m. at Thou Bernsing Also she
is to follow up with Dr. Chivers who would arrange with her ,
after she home.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Tylenol 650 mg by mouth every four hours
as needed for headache , digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth daily , Lomotil
2 tabs by mouth four times daily as needed for diarrhea ,
lisinopril 5 mg daily , lorazepam 0.25 mg by mouth in the morning
and midday and then 0.5 mg lorazepam at bedtime , Coumadin 3 mg at
bedtime , Pravachol 20 mg by mouth at bedtime , diltiazem XR 360 mg
daily , Plavix 75 mg daily , Asacol 1200 mg by mouth twice daily ,
cilostazol 50 mg by mouth twice daily , metformin 500 mg by mouth
twice daily , Advair Diskus 250/50 one puff inhaled twice daily ,
Spiriva 18 mcg inhaled daily , Lopressor 100 mg by mouth four
times daily and Lovenox 60 mg subq twice daily and to continue
until she had her INR checked and it was greater than 2.
