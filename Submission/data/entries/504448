***********************Hosp Course***********************************
1 ) Lightheadedness: unclear etiology but most likely 2/2 elevated BP
&gt;200s as sxs resolved with BP lowering. She was not orthostatic , hct at
baseline , cardiac enzymes negative , and prior MRI/MRA in 2004 without
acute process. Her BP remained well controlled back on her home regimen
( ? compliance but she states she was taking her meds ). Will have outpt
MRI/MRA done , though low suspicion for disease and unclear if would
intervene if disease present. Given HTN spells , concern for a cause of
secondary hypertension. Labs sent for plasma catecholamines , aldoseterone
and plasma rening ( pending as of discharge )
2 )DM: -Aspart SS while in house but continued her home DM meds on day of
discharge.
3 )Disp: d/c to home and she will f/u with Dr Laychock in clinic.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please be sure to take all of your blood pressure medications every day
as prescribed. We think your symptoms were caused by very high blood
pressures.
Please be sure to follow up with Dr Carlos .
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
1. Please follow up with plasma catecholamines , plasma renin and
aldosterone ( taken when patient supine , in am ).
2. Consider HCTZ if an additional agent is needed for BP control
