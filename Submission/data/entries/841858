Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: HONSINGER , ANDREA MD
SERVICE: Cardiology.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary edema , hypertensive urgency ,
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction , status post
catheterization.
LIST OF PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertension since at least 1995.
2. Diabetes.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Obstructive sleep apnea , on CPAP.
5. Status post cerebrovascular accident.
6. Pneumonia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient , Mr. Genuario is a
44-year-old married Hispanic male with a history of diabetes;
hypertension; hypercholesterolemia; and obstructive sleep apnea ,
on CPAP , who presented to the Ryans Valley Hospital Emergency Room on June ,
2005 , with complaint of shortness of breath. His wife reported
that he has been experiencing gradually worsening shortness of
breath since the afternoon of March , 2005 , without any chest
pain. He has increased dyspnea on exertion , needing to use a
CPAP at night. He was found to be hypertensive to the 200/100 ,
with florid pulmonary edema and hypertensive encephalopathy. The
patient was then intubated for airway protection and oxygenation
and admitted to the R.f. Hospital ICU where he was diuresed
aggressively. The patient's hypertension was difficult to
control , requiring labetalol initially and then a successful
regimen of IV nitroglycerin , nitroprusside , hydralazine , and
Lopressor. The patient received a TEE on June , 2005 , which
showed concentric LVH , no wall motion abnormalities , and EF of
45%. There was a concern for aortic dissection on
echocardiogram , but an MRI/MRA revealed no dissection. The
patient was also frequently agitated requiring increasing doses
of Versed and fentanyl as well as p.r.n. Haldol and Zyprexa.
During the admission to Nymo Hospital , he had lateral ST segment
depressions on multiple EKGs and a non-ST-elevation MI ( NSTEMI )
with a peak troponin of 20 on June , 2005 , a peak CK of 430 ,
and a peak MB of 20. He was started on ASA , heparin ,
beta-blocker , statin , and Integrilin and transferred to the IH
on January , 2005 , for management for possible catheterization.
At the Mancharl Tuvange Memorial Hospital ICU , the patient also had marked hyperglycemia
and was put on a ??___?? protocol.
At the Ston N CCU , he was found to have a cardiac enzyme leak
with a peak CK of 286 , CK-MB of 6.2 , and troponin of 13.8 , which
trended down. His EKG showed signs of evolving anterior MI. The
patient was continued to be maintained on aspirin , Plavix , and
Lipitor while Integrilin was discontinued on CCU day #2 as the
patient was not stable for cardiac catheterization. His blood
pressure continued to be very difficult to control. The patient
came in from the PAMC with a nitroglycerin drip , which was weaned
and transitioned to Norvasc 5 mg q.d. , captopril 25 t.i.d. ,
Lopressor 100 q.i.d. , and hydralazine 50 q.i.d. However , his
blood pressure continued to rise ??___?? on CCU day #4 and
Nipride drip was initiated. This increase was in the setting of
confusion ??___??. His Nipride was weaned on day #5 and his p.o.
blood pressure medications were restarted with systolic blood
pressure goal of 140. The patient also had an episode of sinus
pause of greater than 2.5 seconds on July , 2005 , with no
symptoms. IV labetalol was discontinued after that episode.
CCU course was complicated by the patient spiking a fever to
104.1 on CCU day #3 , and he was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics for presumptive ICU pneumonia. He was started on
vancomycin , ceftazidime , and levofloxacin was added. The CCU
course was also complicated by the patient developing left-sided
weakness in the left lower extremity on ICU day #5 , which was
concerning for CVA. An MRI/MRA was obtained which showed small
vessel disease consistent with hypertension-induced
cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of embolism. An
echocardiogram was obtained and was negative for any cardiac
sources and emboli and with a negative bubble study. Secondary
to the patient's mental status and question of inability to
swallow , an NG tube was placed; however , it was self-discontinued
by the patient on July , 2005. The patient was transferred to
the cardiology team on March , 2005 , for further medical
management prior to cardiac catheterization for the
non-ST-elevation MI.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for chest pain , shortness of breath ,
dyspnea on exertion , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , fevers ,
chills , and dysuria.

date.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 44-year-old male with history of
hypertension , diabetes , high cholesterol , and obstructive sleep
apnea presenting with hypertensive crisis , pulmonary edema ,
status post ICU stay complicated by multiple strokes and
left-sided weakness , non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
likely demand ischemia secondary to hypertension and agitation ,
hyperglycemia requiring ??___?? protocol , and question of
ICU-acquired pneumonia with spiking fever needing the use of
broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient is now transferred to
the floor for further management prior to catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. CV: Ischemia: EKG showing sign of an evolving anterior MI.
The patient continued to be on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor. The
patient received a catheterization on November , 2005 , which shows
left oblique marginal #1 with 90% discrete lesion that was
stented to 0 with a DES stent and RCA with 80% discrete lesion
stented to 0. The patient was stable postcatheterization.
Pump: The patient's blood pressure continued to be high on the
floor. He was started on captopril 50 t.i.d. , eventually
increased to 100 t.i.d.; hydralazine 20 q.i.d. IV , eventually
switching over to 50 p.o. q.i.d. The patient was restarted on
home medication of clonidine patch as discontinuation can cause
labile hypertension. He was also started on Lasix 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d. During the catheterization , the patient was found to have
a pulmonary wedge pressure of 17 , which is elevated. He was
given IV Lasix to diurese. He diuresed very well with the p.o.
and IV dose.
Rhythm: The patient had two episodes of sinus pause greater than
3 seconds on July , 2005 , with no episodes since July ,
2005. It could be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea versus
conduction abnormality. Electrophysiology service was consulted.
The EP service encouraged the patient to wear a CPAP device
during the day. His beta-blocker was held secondary to the sinus
pause. However , after the catheterization and with the result of
obstructive lesion , the patient was restarted on low-dose
beta-blocker with atenolol 25 mg q.d.
2. Pulmonary: When transferred , the patient's sedation was
weaned and he was without any pressure on CCU day #4. He had
received Lasix for pulmonary edema. He continued to diuresed on
the floor with 80 mg p.o. of Lasix.
3. ID: The patient had spiked a fever to 104.1 on January ,
2005 , with a question of pneumonia. He was continued on his
vancomycin , ceftazidime , and levofloxacin for a 14-day course.
His vancomycin will be completed on discharge while he will need
to continue on ceftazidime and levofloxacin during
rehabilitation. The patient was MRSA negative. He continues to
have low-grade fever , but no frank fever over 100.4. The patient
continued to improve and does not complain of any subjective
fever.
4. GI: The patient received an NG tube on July , 2005 , but it
was self-discontinued. He had speech and swallow test , which he
passed and was started on the house diet. The patient received a
nutrition consult for his diabetes and was put on a cardiac and
diabetic diet. His magnesium and potassium were repleted.
5. Renal: On admission , his creatinine was 1.6 and trended down
to 1.2 and 1.1 prior to discharge. We thought that his
increasing creatinine is likely secondary from hypertensive
injury. The patient was given Mucomyst prior and after
catheterization. He tolerated the ACE inhibition with no rise in
creatinine.
6. Neurologic: On CCU day #5 , the patient developed weakness in
the left upper and lower extremity with concern for CVA.
Neurologic consult was initiated and MRI and MRA were obtained.
MRI/MRA showed small vessel disease consistent with
hypertension-induced CVA. He had a negative echocardiogram and
negative bubble study. The patient was given some physical
therapy and will likely need rehabilitation.
7. Endocrine: The patient takes Humalog 75/25 50 units before
breakfast and 20 units before dinner , NPH 20 at bedtime , and also
Actos and metformin. Here , the patient was given a NovoLog
sliding scale with 14 units of NovoLog q.a.c. and Lantus 35
q.h.s. He will be continued on these doses and will need to be
transitioned to his home medications once he goes home.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive PPI and heparin for
prophylaxis.
CODE: Full.
DISPOSITION: The patient will likely need rehabilitation for his
prolonged ICU course and also for his stroke.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The discharge medications will be
dictated as an addendum pending discharge.
