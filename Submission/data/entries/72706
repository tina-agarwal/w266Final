HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a postoperative followup visit. Mr.
Ulbricht is a very pleasant 46-year-old African-American male who comes
in approximately two weeks after having an open cholecystectomy for
gangrenous cholecystitis. The postoperative course was complicated by a
bile leak from the cystic duct. The patient had an ERCP with a stent
placement by Dr. Mauro Mathias The patient will have this removed in two
months. Otherwise , the patient is doing well with no fevers , chills , or
sweats. No nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. He is having normal bowel
movements and tolerating a regular diet. He has a midline ventral hearing
in the subxiphoid region near his cardiac transplant incision site. For

incision is healing well and the staples are taken out. He has a midline
ventral hernia in the subxiphoid region near his cardiac transplant
incision site. The hernia is somewhat symptomatic but the defect was very
large. We have elected to repair this in the fall as the patient has
several obligations in the next couple of months.
