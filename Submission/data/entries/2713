Discharge Date: 11/25/2001
CHIEF COMPLAINT: A 29-year-old G 3 P 2 admitted on postoperative
day #19 , status post a STAT cesarean section at
29 weeks for fetal bradycardia following laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. She was readmitted for wound infection.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient's past medical history
is significant for cardiac transplant
in 1989 for a dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient is on multiple
immunosuppressants. The patient had several episodes of acute
cholecystitis and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy nineteen
days prior to admission. Fetal bradycardia developed immediately
following the cholecystectomy and a STAT cesarean section was
performed. The patient was returned to the Cardiology Service for
further management of fluid status and mild congestive heart failure.
She was discharged on postoperative day #7. On 6/28 the patient
was seen in the MFM practice and a wound hematoma on the left side was
noted. It was and drained with normal , healthy tissue identified.
She had b.i.d. dressing changes with a visiting nurse. On the day of
admission the patient noted a temperature to 100.0 , slightly foul-smelling
discharge from the wound. She denied abdominal pain. The patient
also noted that the right foot pain present at the time of surgery
had been worsening over the course of the day and was noted to be
swollen and erythematous at the time of admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Viral cardiomyopathy , now status post
transplant , hypertension , chronic renal
insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4-1.8 ,
hyperlipidemia , obesity , history of group A Strep sepsis in 1998.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cesarean section x 2 in 1998 and 2001 ,
laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 4/13 ,
D&amp;E for SAb in 21 of June , status post eye surgery in 1973.
MEDICATIONS: Imuran 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.; cyclosporin 125 mg p.o.
q.d.; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.; pravastatin 10 mg
p.o. q. h.s.; quinidine sulfate 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Kaopectate 30
mg p.o. q. i.d.; Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.; miconazole topical 2%
p.r.n.; Tylenol #3 1-2 p.o. q. 4-6h p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES: Sulfa , penicillin , IVP dye all cause pink rash ,
succinylcholine resulted in respiratory arrest.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.6 ,
blood pressure 120/60 ,
respirations 18 , pulse 74. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Obese ,
nontender , nondistended , incision was open at two sites. There was
gray , malodorous fluid draining from the wound. The wound tracked
superiorly on the left. The fascia was intact. There was no
evidence of necrotic tissue. EXTREMITIES: Distal extremities had
trace edema , right greater than left with erythema and tenderness
on the dorsal surface of the right ankle.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Wound infection: An Infectious Disease
consult was obtained at the time of admission and
the patient was sent for immediate intraoperative treatment and
wound debridement. Surgery was consulted intraoperatively to
confirm healthy tissue and no evidence of necrosis. The patient
was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin IV and t.i.d. dressing
changes. Blood cultures obtained prior to antibiotic therapy were
negative for bacteremia. Cultures of the wound were consistent
with Strep and diphtheroids with obvious polymicrobial involvement.
On hospital day #3 blood cultures which had been drawn from the
patient's indwelling line returned with 2/4 bottles positive for
gram-positive cocci in clusters. The central line was discontinued.
The patient began treatment on vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 12h , levofloxacin
was continued and the Flagyl was started 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. The
patient remained afebrile throughout this time. A CT of the abdomen
and pelvis was obtained per Infectious Disease recommendation and it
confirmed that there was no intraabdominal abscess. The patient was
continued on IV vancomycin with p.o. Flagyl and levofloxacin until
8/21/01 , hospital day #8. At that point the patient was discharged to
home with visiting nurse and continued IV and p.o. antibiotics x 14
days. Cultures obtained following discontinuation of her central
line returned as negative. On hospital day #6 the patient had
a significant yeast infection surrounding the lower aspect of the
incision as well as in the intertriginous areas. This was treated
with topical nystatin.
2 ) Cardiovascular: The patient's cardiac standpoint remained
stable throughout the admission with no evidence of congestive
heart failure. Routine echo was performed on 1/15/01 as scheduled
per her transplant protocol. There were no other cardiovascular
issues during the patient's admission.
3 ) Renal: The patient had a baseline history of renal
insufficiency as described above with a creatinine of 2.1 on
admission. Creatinine increased during her admission to a maximum
of 3.1. She was also noted to have decreasing urine output at that
time. Adjustments were made in vancomycin and cyclosporin levels
and the patient's creatinine slowly returned to baseline with
significant improvement of urine output.
4 ) GI: The patient had no difficulties with bowel function until
hospital day #5 when patient was noting increasingly loose
stools. C. diff. was obtained x 2 and were negative. She was
treated with Imodium p.r.n.
5 ) Rheumatology: The patient had initially right ankle pain and
swelling noted at the time of admission. A Rheumatology consult
was obtained and the joint was tapped and there was no evidence of
infection at that time. The patient was continued to be followed
by Rheumatology and , based on Rheumatology and Transplant Team
recommendations , was treated with colchicine for the diagnosis of
gout on immunosuppressant medications. The possibility of plantar
fasciitis was raised during admission and treatment was pain
medication , continued colchicine and physical therapy. The patient
was able to ambulate at the time of discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin 750 mg IV q. 12h; levofloxacin
500 mg p.o. q.d.; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
x 14 days; Percocet 1-2 p.o. q. 3-4h p.r.n. pain.
The patient had a visiting nurse established for continued b.i.d.
dressing changes at home and to obtain vancomycin and cyclosporin
levels as needed.
FOLLOWUP: She will be followed by her cardiac transplant team to
follow her antibiotic and immunosuppressant levels. She
was scheduled for routine follow up with the cardiac transplant
team with no changes in appointment time , follow up with OB/GYN in
two weeks' time.
