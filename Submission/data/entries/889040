Discharge Date: 4/14/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Atrial flutter.
PROBLEMS: Coronary artery disease. New atrial fibrillation..
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Tarboro is a 50 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary
artery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft
( CABG ) performed at Hilltans Spizee Memorial Medical Center two weeks prior to
his admission. He presents with three days of palpitations. On
26 of May , Mr. Almgren underwent cardiac catheterization which showed
100% occlusion of the proximal LAD and 70% occlusion of the
circumflex. He subsequently had a two vessel CABG at Healtsa Men'sas Health Center with attachment of the LIMA to the LAD and the left
radial artery to the circumflex. Postoperatively he went into
atrial fibrillation which later converted to normal sinus rhythm ,
and he was discharged in stable condition on 0 of March on a medical
regimen of aspirin 325 mg q day , diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. to prevent
vasospasm of radial artery , Atenolol 25 b.i.d. Three days prior to
this admission , the patient noted palpitations of his heart with
fluttering of the neck associated with clamminess and diaphoresis.
He felt no chest pain , no nausea , vomiting , or shortness of breath ,
but VNA noted that his 150 beats per minute. The patient presented
to the Navail Hospital emergency room on 27 of February where EKG showed
him to be in atrial fibrillation alternating with atrial flutter
with a two-to-one block. An echocardiogram performed in the
emergency room showed an ejection fraction of 54% with a mild
pericardial effusion. By report from Ties Hospital , the
patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. He was sent home on his
previous medical regimen of Atenolol and aspirin with an increased
dose of diltiazem to 60 t.i.d. The patient felt well on discharge
with no chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , and no
syncope. Laboratory studies in the Lukes Loton Health Services emergency room showed
low CK of 31 with troponin of 0.3 , magnesium 2.4. On the morning
of admission , 10 of November , the patient noted palpitations again with a
rapid heart rate to 140 to 150. He presented to the Pack General Hospital emergency room. As previously , the patient denied
associated symptoms of chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea ,
vomiting , abdominal pain , back pain , PND , or orthopnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 100.1 F , heart rate 130 to 140
regular , blood pressure 108/74 , respiratory
rate 16. O2 saturation 96% on room air. The patient was an obese
Caucasian male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam revealed pupils
equal , round , and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles intact.
Oropharynx clear with no exudate or erythema. Neck supple with no
cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy , no thyroid
enlargement. Chest - full , symmetric expansion. Clear to
auscultation with no rales or wheezes. Well healed sternal
surgical scar. Cardiovascular exam - jugular venous pressure at 8
cm. Normal S1 and S2. Rhythm irregularly irregular. No murmur ,
S3 , or S4. Carotid pulses 2+ bilaterally , no bruits. Abdominal
exam , soft , nontender , nondistended , no organomegaly , plus bowel
sounds. Extremities , no cyanosis , edema , or tenderness , warm and
well perfused with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurological exam , alert and oriented X3. Cranial nerves II
through XII intact. Motor and sensory exam normal with 2+ patellar
reflexes , toes down going.
LABORATORY: On admission showed sodium 142 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride 102 , CO2 26 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose
104. White blood cell count 6.68 , hematocrit 31.0 , platelets 299.
18% lymphocytes , 71.8% neutrophils. PT 12.9 , INR 1.2 , PTT 24.4.
CK on admission 28. CT 0.08.
Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion but no evidence of
congestive heart failure or infiltrate.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 130 beats per minute. Normal
axis with Q waves in 3 , AVF , V1 through V4. Unchanged from
previous EKG.
Calcium 8.7 with an albumin of 3.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was treated with a medical regimen on
admission of increased Atenolol to 50 b.i.d. ,
continued diltiazem at 30 mg t.i.d. , continued aspirin. Was loaded
with heparin bolus of 5000 , and loaded with procainamide at a rate
of 750 mg q 6 hours. Despite loading with procainamide for a total
of 5.25 grams over 36 hours , the patient maintained rhythm of
atrial flutter with two to one block throughout his hospital course
with occasional variable conduction of three to one block
alternating with two to one block , occasional breaks to atrial
fibrillation. An echocardiogram was performed in hospital on
3 of October which showed an ejection fraction of 30% decreased from 45%
on his last Contisifoundt.warne Kett Hospital echocardiogram dated March , 1999.
The echocardiogram from 3 of October also showed left ventricle normal
in size with moderate concentric LVH , reduced LV function , left
atrium enlargement , with no evidence of thrombus. Normal valves
with a small pericardial effusion. Other causes for atrial
fibrillation were considered. TSH came back normal at 3.1. New
onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter was felt to be
consistent with pericardial inflammation post surgery. The patient
was maintained on procainamide throughout duration of stay. Dose
was increased on 21 of October to procainamide SR 1000 mg q.i.d.
However , this attempt at pharmacological cardioversion did not
succeed in attaining normal sinus rhythm. The patient was
presented with option of two to three weeks anticoagulation as an
out patient with rate control on Atenolol and diltiazem to be
followed by elective DC cardioversion at the end of three weeks.
Also discussed was the option of performing a transesophageal echo
followed by in house DC cardioversion. The patient and Dr.
Pulkrabek chose the first option. The patient was started on
Coumadin and attained INR of 1.7 by the day of discharge , 21 of April
Although patient had maintained atrial flutter rhythm throughout
hospital stay , hemodynamically had been stable with pulse ranging
between 76 to 110 with occasional tachycardia during activity and
during the morning hours ranging from 120 to 130. Blood pressure
ranged between 90 to 110 systolic pressure. There was a
significant concern regarding the patient's decreased ejection
fraction to 30% from preoperative 45% , felt to be possibly
secondary to negative inotropic medications as well as atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However , could not
rule out possibility of new infarct or ischemia causing decreased
LV function. In addition to his previous medications , the patient
was discharged on Digoxin .25 mg q day and with instructions to
follow up with Dr. Riherd regarding his dose of procainamide
as well as the possibility of adding a low dose ace inhibitor.
Patient will be followed by VNA Services and by Anticoagulation
Service managed by Keith Foy for INR monitoring and will return
to Ertri Brown Memorial Hospital in two to three weeks for elective DC
cardioversion.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg q day. Atenolol 50 mg
b.i.d. Diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d.
Procainamide SR 1000 mg q.i.d. Coumadin 5 mg q hs. Pravachol 40
mg q hs. Digoxin 0.25 mg q day. Colace 100 mg q day. Captopril
12.5 mg q day to be filled only on specific instructions by Dr.
Bojko
FOLLOW UP: The patient will follow up with Dr. Scroggy on
Monday , 4 of October , by phone regarding medication changes
and will return to Inhunt Memorial Medical in two to three weeks
for DC cardioversion.
The patient and his wife will continue to monitor heart rate and
blood pressure with home blood pressure cuff to follow vital signs
and have been instructed to call Dr. Wainkrantz if heart rate
exceeds 140 beats per minute or if patient experiences symptoms of
chest pain , shortness of breath , or increased palpitations , as well
as sign of blood in stools or excessive bruising.
The patient was discharged to home with VNA services in stable
condition.
