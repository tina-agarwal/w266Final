of DVTs , status post right lumpectomy , history of NSVT status
post AICD placement , hypertension , coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction x2 , COPD on home oxygen ,
hypothyroidism , depression , gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
dilated cardiomyopathy.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a 63-year-old female
with multiple medical problems admitted 5/27/06 after
ventricular VFib arrest with AICD discharge and associated fall
on Coumadin. Current mental status limits history but per prior
notes , the patient fell on 9/15/06 with loss of consciousness
for two or three minutes after feeling dizzy. She presented to
the Emergency Department on 5/27/06 with complaints of 8/10
headaches; the RN at the assisted living facility
suggested that she be evaluated immediately postfall. The
patient complains of confusion postfall , lasting until
presentation. She denied nausea or vomiting. Headache had been
constant since fall. Also , complains of right knee pain that was
worse with ambulation. Head CT noted intracranial hemorrhage ,
subdural hemorrhage and small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Her INR
at that time was 3.3. She was admitted to the MICU on the
Neurosurgical Service from 5/27/06 to 5/23/06 without operative
intervention. She received factor VII , multiple units of FFP ,
and subcutaneous vitamin K for elevated INR. She was empirically
started on seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin and Keppra , followed
closely by Neurology and a continuous EEG monitoring. ICU course
was notable for slowly rising LFTs ascribed to Dilantin ,
worsening acute on chronic renal failure , congestive heart
failure with volume overload and persistent encephalopathy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Again is significant for diabetes
mellitus , gout , history of DVTs , lumpectomy followed by
mastectomy for breast cancer in 2004 , chronic renal failure;
baseline creatinine of approximately 2 , history of NSVTs with
AICD placement , hypertension , coronary artery disease , two MIs in
the past , COPD , home oxygen , hypothyroidism , depression , GERD ,
dilated cardiomyopathy due to Adriamycin with an ejection
fraction of 25%.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in an assisted living facility. No
history of tobacco , ethanol , or IV drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO FLOOR: Vital signs ,
temperature 96 , pulse 68 , blood pressure 140/70 , respiratory rate
18 , oxygen saturation 100% on room air. She was somnolent ,
seated in a chair , responding to voice , answers single questions
appropriately , but was intermittently requiring painful stimuli
for arousal. Head and neck exam , sclerae were anicteric. JVP
was difficult to assess secondary to jaw movement and tooth
grinding. Cardiovascular exam , regular rate and rhythm , 2/6
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and apex , clear
to auscultation bilaterally in both lung fields. Abdomen was
distended and tympanic. Nonpitting edema of the extremities.
Dorsalis pedis pulses were not palpable. Neurologically , she
occasionally answers questions , was alert and oriented x3 when
awake , followed command intermittently , tracking when awake.
Neurological assessment was difficult due to lack of the patient
cooperation. On her skin , there were no gross lesions.

phosphatase 175 , albumin 3.9. CBC , white blood count 11 ,
hematocrit 37.8 , platelets 227. Urinalysis , 2+ leukocyte
esterase , 9 white blood cells , 20 red blood cells. BNP was 1764 ,
ammonia 48. Dilantin level 10.8.
EKG on transfer , normal sinus rhythm , 73 beats per minute ,
first-degree AVB , right axis deviation , IVCD. Echo on 10/18/06 ,
dilated left ventricle with an EF of 25% unchanged from August
2005 , global hypokinesis with akinesis of inferior septum while
on apex. Mildly reduced left ventricular function with
mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation , mild-to-moderate tricuspid
regurg , dilated and nonpulsatile IVC. Chest x-ray on 5/27/06 PA
and lateral showed stable cardiac enlargement with prominent
septa interstitium , no evidence of pulmonary vascular edema. AP
chest x-ray on 10/18/06 appear unchanged from prior imaging with
stable mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral airspace
disease worse on the right. Appearances were consistent with
asymmetric pulmonary edema. The right cardiac pacemaker device
overlies the chest wall on the right with a single terminating in
the right ventricle. No pneumothorax was visualized. Right
upper quadrant sono 5/27/06 , hepatic cirrhosis , limited
evaluation of gallbladder due to contraction , but no classic
Murphy sign. 10/5/06 , right upper quadrant ultrasound showed
thickened gallbladder wall and gallbladder sludge , small amount
of ascites , trace to small right pleural effusion. CT scan of
the head on 5/27/06 showed 1.7 x 2 cm intraparenchymal
hemorrhage within the right temporal lobe suspicious for
hemorrhagic metastasis. Given additional smaller areas of high
attenuation within the left parietal lobe. A component of which
appears were arachnoid and right convexity also suspicious for
metastatic disease. Hemorrhage likely subarachnoid within the
quadrigeminal plate cistern on the right extending along the
tentorium. 5/27/06 , repeat head CT no significant interval
change in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right
temporal lobe suspicious for hemorrhagic metastasis. 9/14/06
head CT with gadolinium unchanged parenchymal and subarachnoid
hemorrhage. 10/18/06 CT of head , slight interval decrease in
size of left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage , which was small ,
unchanged intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right
temporoparietal region. Stable hemorrhoids within the
quadrigeminal cistern. CT of C-spine on 5/27/06 , no dramatic
bony fracture of the cervical spine , partially imaged right
temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Plain of right knee ,
5/27/06 , findings consistent with osteoarthritis most marked
within the medial compartment , moderate joint effusion , no
radiographic evidence of acute displaced fracture.
IMPRESSION: A 63-year-old woman with traumatic contusion ,
subdural hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage now
encephalopathic with hepatotoxicity and acute on chronic renal
insufficiency with volume overload in the setting of longstanding
cardiomyopathy.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Neuro: Intracranial hemorrhage status post fall. The patient
followed by Neurology and Neurosurgery. Started on antiepileptic
prophylaxis in the setting of ICH , no tapering on Dilantin.
Also , on Keppra 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. which was adjusted for renal
failure. The patient has been on continuos EEG monitoring with
right PLEDs though no frank seizure activity. All AEDs was
stopped and with continuing EEG monitoring , encephalopathy of
unclear etiology , hepatic source versus bleed related hemorrhage
versus medication. The patient was able to ambulate at baseline ,
frequently falls asleep but was always easy to arouse and
talkative to the daughter. On the date of discharge , she was
conversant , alert and oriented x3 and significantly improved in
mental status relative to time of presentation. To follow up
with Dr. Phillip Arrequin of Neurosurgery in one month.
Cardiovascular: History of coronary artery disease , no
significant evidence of acute event by cardiac enzymes to explain
VFib. 10/18/06 echo with EF of 25% unchanged from August 2005.
She remained on standing torsemide twice a day , status post VFib
arrest. She was followed by EP on overall amiodarone taper and
telemetry.
Pulmonary: Stable on nasal cannula , though with frequent benefit
from diuresis as needed.
Hematologically , the patient received 3 doses of vitamin K from
admission through 10/18/06 . Received multiple FFP transfusions
to maintain INR less than 1.4. Coumadin was held in the setting
of her recent bleed. Question of anticoagulation to be
readdressed with Dr. Stwart in one month. She received subcutaneous
heparin for DVT prophylaxis , which was okayed by Neurosurgery.
ID: The patient received a course of ciprofloxacin for UTI.
Renal: Acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency consistent with
relative prerenal state in the setting of volume overload. The
patient was diuresed with torsemide and metolazone.
GI: The patient was maintained on a diabetic diet though with
only scant p.o. intake at first. The patient progressed to
tolerate p.o. intake and when her mental status had improved she
was requesting meals on her own. LFTs were intermittently
elevated with a peak bili of 4 , peak AST of 111 , ALT of 90.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound remained unremarkable , though
beyond gallbladder sludge. The elevated LFTs were attributed to
be most likely due to Dilantin. The patient was maintained on
standing lactulose to relieve encephalopathy.
Endocrine: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient was
maintained on Lantus as she was outpatient and as well as regular
doses of Regular Insulin on a sliding scale. She had episodic
hypoglycemia at the initial stages of hospital course and
progressed to a more chronic mild hyperglycemia in the 200 to 300
range with further adjustment of her insulin dosage.
Orthopedic: Her right knee pain status post fall. Despite of
the right knee pain , after the fall , there was no evidence of
acute injury and she received supportive care. She continued to
receive heparin prophylaxis and was maintained on pneumoboots for
DVT prophylaxis.
The patient was full code status throughout entire hospital
course.
