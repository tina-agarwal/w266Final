HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Zack Nieman is a 62-year-old 
white man with ischemic
cardiomyopathy , status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1985
with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending ,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery , saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal branch. He had a repeat coronary artery
bypass graft done in 1995 with saphenous vein graft to first
diagonal , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal , and saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery. The course was
complicated by ventricular tachycardia requiring AICD placement and
treatment with amiodarone. The patient also developed
hyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone , treated with PTU , then
developed hypothyroidism , treated with Levothyroxine.
Over the past few months the patient has had multiple episodes of
pulmonary congestion. About one week ago prior to this admission the
patient was admitted to Rorea Valley Health for IV diuresis.
Echocardiography demonstrated that a reduced LV ejection fraction in
the mid 20's with moderate mitral regurgitation. Recent EKGs
provided by the Scot Free Of Hospital and on admission here shows
atrial flutter with variable ventricular rate. On admission the
patient denied peripheral edema , orthopnea , or recent gain in
weight. A recent TSH revealed 10. No recent excess caffeine or
alcohol consumption.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for ( 1 ) coronary artery
disease , status post coronary artery
bypass graft times two; ( 2 ) hypertension; ( 3 ) hypothyroidism;
( 4 ) dyslipidemia; ( 5 ) benign prostatic hypertrophy; ( 6 )
degenerative joint disease; ( 7 ) non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.
ALLERGIES: The patient has a known allergy to morphine and to
tetanus toxoid.
FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of myocardial infarction at age 66.
Mother died of myocardial infarction at age 63.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco use. No alcohol use. Very active
athletically. He works as a superintendant.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance , very pleasant man
in no apparent distress. Temperature
97.1 , pulse 103 , blood pressure 148/94 , respirations 18 , O2
saturation 97% on two liters. HEENT pupils are equal , round , and
reactive to light. Sclerae anicteric. Oral pharynx clear and
moist. Jugular venous pressure about 8-9 cm. No carotid bruits.
Chest clear to auscultation and percussion. No rales and no
wheezes. Heart paradoxical S2 , II/VI systolic murmur. Abdomen
soft , nontender , with no pulsatile masses. Lower extremities no
edema , no cyanosis , or clubbing. Rectal examination normal , guaiac
negative. Neurological examination grossly intact.
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 141 , potassium 4.4 ,
chloride 101 , bicarb 34 , BUN 19 ,
creatinine 1.3 , glucose 220 , AST 22 , ALK 53 , total bilirubin 0.6 ,
calcium 9.8 , total protein 7.1 , albumin 4.4 , magnesium 1.9 , CK 477 ,
MB 2.7 , PT 12.7 , INR 1.1 , PTT 24.2. Urinalysis 1+ glucose ,
otherwise negative.
EKG revealed atrial flutter with variable block ( 2:1 versus 3:1 ) ,
rate around 120 , left bundle branche block.
Echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction about 25% with 2+ mitral
regurgitation.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's hospital course was notable for the
following: Upon transfer from Nes Hospital
to A Hospital the patient had no complaints of
shortness of breath or chest pain. However , the patient was having
atrial flutter with various blocks. The ventricular response at
that time was between 120-130. On the day of admission the patient also had
echocardiogram repeated which revealed ejection fraction 25% with
2+ mitral regurgitation.
Because of his rapid ventricular response , Digoxin was started with
a loading dose of 0.5 mg , then 0.25 mg times two q. six hours. The
patient was then on a maintenance dose of Digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o.
q. day , and his Digoxin level has been maintained around 0.9. For
his rate control , the amiodarone was also increased to 400 mg q.
day , and the patient was started on anticoagulation with heparin.
On November the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed old grafts serving the left anterior descending ,
posterior descending artery , obtuse marginal , patent. The
saphenous vein graft to first diagonal has 70% proximal stenosis.
Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 10-15%. Post
catheterization the patient had no complications. The patient also
had a TEE done which showed no thrombosis. Therefore on July the patient underwent cardioversion through his AICD by the
Electrophysiological Service with successful conversion to normal
sinus rhythm. The patient was loaded with Coumadin and meanwhile
on heparin until INR between 2-3.
For further investigation of his cardiomyopathy , iron studies were
sent to rule out hemochromatosis. The results were negative.
Cardiomyopathy consult was also obtained to follow-up the patient.
The patient will be discharged when his INR approaches the
therapeutic level , which is between 2-3.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Captopril
25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , clonazepam 1 mg p.o.
q. h.s. , Klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. q. a.m. , Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,

sodium 100 mcg p.o. q.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) one tab
sublingual q. five minutes times three , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. day
until INR between 2-3 then the dose needs to be adjusted
accordingly to maintain INR between 2-3 , Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.
h.s. , isosorbide , mononitrate-SR 30 mg p.o. q.d. , and troglipazone
400 mg p.o. q. day.
CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE: Stable.
DISPOSITION/FOLLOW-UP: The patient will be discharged to home
on 0 of August with a follow-up
appointment with Dr. Furbeck , Rudy Lonny Napoleon D. of the
Cardiomyopathy Service.
