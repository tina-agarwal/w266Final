age admitted for blood sugar control after first prenatal visit
in Special OB Clinic. Her dating is by her last menstrual
period , which was 4/2/05 , giving her an estimated date of
confinement of 4/17/05 .  An ultrasound at 14 weeks done during
an ER admission for vaginal bleeding confirmed her gestational

140's/90's several months prior to pregnancy. Her blood pressure

pregnancy , per the patient her blood sugars prior to pregnancy
ranged from the 120-180 range and that she reports she has never
needed to take insulin. She had a visit at Til Dr. , Burg A Rill and was
given a glucometer and known fasting sugars ranged from the
90s-140s and one hour postprandials ranged from 140-230.
4. She is a smoker.
5. History of depression. She currently takes Remeron and is
followed by her outpatient psychiatrist with whom she has had a
longstanding relationship. Given that the Remeron was a class C

spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Her largest baby was 7 pounds 12
ounces.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Her blood pressure is 139/79. She is well appearing. Her heart
was regular rate and rhythm. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft and obese. It is
difficult to assess fundal height. Pelvic exam had normal
mucosa , normal cervix. Bimanual exam revealed approximately 22
weeks size uterus with audible fetal heart tones.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Diabetes: Given the late time in the day of her appointment
and the inability to establish proper diabetic teaching as an
outpatient , she was admitted for diabetic teaching and control.
She had never previously used medications and has had reportedly
poor control with diet. Risks of diabetes were discussed. She
was started on a regimen of 14 of N q.a.m. and 14 of N at bedtime
with 6 of Humalog premeal as per Dr. Haggett . Her sugars overnight
while in-house were as follows: 100 fasting , 175 approximately
two hours postprandial , 157 and then a fasting of 94 this is
while receiving that stated insulin regimen. She was seen by the
Diabetes Management Service and Dr. Saunders on 10/9/05 who
recommended increasing her prebreakfast and predinner Humalog to
8. She will need an Ophthalmology consult as an outpatient.
Hemoglobin A1c was sent and was 5.3.
2. Hypertension: Given her elevated blood pressure of 139/79 in
clinic and her history that was notable for potentially a
longstanding hypertension , her blood pressure was monitored
closely and baseline preeclampsia labs were sent. Her blood
pressure overnight was within normal limits with values this
morning of 108/60 seated and 90/50 lying. She had a normal BUN ,
creatinine , ALT , AST , and uric acid. A 24-hour urine protein was
completed during this hospitalization and the results are pending
at the time of this dictation.
3. History of depression: Her Remeron was discontinued and I
discussed her symptoms of depression with her in greater detail.
She said that she primarily uses Remeron as a sleep aid and the
major side effect she experiences with withdrawal of Remeron is
nightmares. She does not feel as if she has a problem with
depression and declined a psychiatry consultation while in the
hospital. She has an outpatient psychiatrist whom she has a
longstanding relationship with. I advised to discuss her
pregnancy with her psychiatrist and to be in contact should she
have any concerns. She reported that she always knows if she
needs additional help and will be in contact with her doctor.
4. Fetal well-being: Baseline and prenatal laboratories were
sent on 9/13/05 .  Her blood type is B positive. Her antibody
screen was negative. Her RPR was nonreactive. Her hepatitis B
surface antigen is negative , rubella immune , gonorrhea and
chlamydia are negative. She had an ultrasound done on the
10/9/05 which revealed a singleton intrauterine gestation. Her
placenta was posterior and not previa. She had normal Dopplers
and normal fetal survey. The fetal risks of uncontrolled
diabetes were discussed and she expressed that she understood all
of these concerns.
5. Cardiac. A baseline EKG was obtained which revealed normal
sinus rhythm , normal axis , normal rate , however , her QT-interval
was slightly prolonged at 491 msec. The upper limit of normal in
women is 460. I briefly discussed this finding with the Medicine
Consult Service and Cardiology Service who felt that this is
likely attributable to her low potassium of 3.2. Therefore , high
content potassium foods were encouraged and she will have a
repeat EKG at her prenatal visit next week to evaluate for
resolution of this prolonged QT. Of note , she reports that her
mother had a congenital heart condition and experienced her first
heart attack at the age of 27 due to what she thought was an
enlarged heart. Her mother ultimately died at the age of 56 from
a heart attack. She reports aside from her mom who she does feel
had this condition since birth; no one in her family has
experienced sudden cardiac death. She also has never experienced
palpitations or chest pain.
6. History of kidney stones. A urinalysis was sent which
revealed 1-5 red blood cells and the urine culture showed 10 , 000
of mixed flora.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Given Ms. Bruechert strong desire to be discharged after only a day
of admission , she was discharged to home with the following
instructions:
She is to take her fingerstick blood sugars fasting and at one
hour postprandial intervals and record them prior to her
follow-up appointment. She is also instructed to eat foods high
in potassium and to call the office in an urgent manner should
she develop chest pain or palpitations. She has appointments
scheduled for 7/1/04 with Dr. Gettys in special OB Clinic ,
Dr. Weisse in Endocrine Clinic and Nutrition. She was given
prescriptions for NPH to take 14 units subcu a.m. and 14 units
subcu at bedtime and Humalog 8 units prebreakfast , 6 units
prelunch , and 8 units predinner. She is also advised to take
prenatal vitamins one tablet p.o. daily. She understands all
these follow up plans and has no concerns with her discharge at
this time.
