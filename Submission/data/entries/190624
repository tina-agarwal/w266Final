Problem List
Ischemia: Patient was admitted with troponin leak of 0.16 , no ekg
changes. Patient's subsequent troponins were &lt;assay. Patient's story is
unlikely to be cardiac chest pain. Persantine MIBI was done to rule out
any ischemia. MIBI was negative. Pain could be due to patient's VATS
procedure. Patient was initially placed on heparin , asa , bblocker , ace ,
high dose statin. Heparin was discontinued and patient was d/c'd on her
outpatient cardiac medications.
Pump: BP's elevated in ER to 177/95. It is unclear whether patient had
been taking cardiac meds during the week. When patient was placed back
on her outpatient cardiac bp medicines she was well controlled with bp
130s/80s.
Rhythm: The patient remained in nsr during the hospitalization.
Pulmonary: newly diagnosed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. She was
continued on her home regimen of duonebs , o2 by nasal canula
( 2-4L ).
FEN/GI: Nexium for GI prophylaxis
Endo: h/o hypothyroid last tsh 2.9. Patient was continued on synthroid.
Pain control: The patient has a history of admission for Chest wall pain
for VATS. VATs procedure done 3 weeks ago and per outpatient
pulmonologist , patient had been requiring large doses of opioids per her
family members. The patient , however , did not complain of
increased pain at her outpatient visit. During this admission , the
patient did not request any prn pain medication and was comfortable with
regular heart rate throughout the admission. The patient should no
longer require opioids for pain due to the VATS procedure. We are
recommending that the patient take tylenol for pain and follow up with
her PCP if this is unable to control the pain.
Exam at discharge: NAD , JVP flat , crackes at bases , otherwise CTA b/l ,
rrr , s1 , s2 , no m/r/g. No tenderness to palpation over left ribs/VATS
site. Abdomen benign. Extremities without edema. +clubbing
Labs at discharge: troponin &lt;assay , electrolytes wnl , bun 5 , cr 0.6 , wbc
6.0 , hct 37.6 , plts 374 , chol 191 , tri 107 , hdl 42 , ldl 128 , vldl 21
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take tylenol for your chest pain. See your PCP at the Brookbal Hospital this monday. Take your medications as prescribed.
