SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. Coronary artery disease
2. Hypertension
3. Non-insulin dependent diabetes

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 72 year old white male
Status post recent myocardial
infarction who was admitted for recurrent chest discomfort.
On the 1 of July , the patient noticed a "uncomfortable chest
sensation" as he was driving. He experienced diaphoresis at that
time , but no shortness of breath and no nausea or vomiting. He was
seen at an outside hospital and noted to have 2-3 mm ST elevations
in leads 2 , 3 , FV5 and V6 ( Humpde Hospital ). The patient was given
TPA , Heparin intravenous and aspirin. His peak CPK was noted to be
5 , 742 with an MB fraction of 199. The patient's hospital stay was
complicated by frequent PVCs on cardiac monitor , for which he was
temporarily treated with Lidocaine. Immediately after the TPA
infusion , the patient noted that his chest discomfort which was
located primarily on the left side , across the midline , to the
right. An echocardiogram that was performed , showed an ejection
fraction of 60% with posterolateral dyssynergia. On the 16 of September of
July , the patient was discharged from Cocku Health after a submax
ETT. He reached a heart rate of 95 and blood pressure 168/90.
On the 25 of June , the patient noted that he had a recurrence of
this vague chest discomfort as he was sitting and talking to
friends. He took a sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief. This
chest discomfort episode resolved spontaneously after approximately
ten minutes.
On the 8 of September , the patient was at a party and , again ,
developed a similar anxious sensation which was similar to the
feeling that he experienced prior to his myocardial infarction. He
took two sublingual Nitroglycerin again , without relief , and his
discomfort resolved after two hours. Patient denies PND ,
orthopnea , or edema. The patient was admitted on the 8 of September
for cardiac catheterization to evaluate post myocardial infarction
angina.
ALLERGIES: Include Penicillin and Toprol which leads to an itch.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension for five to
six years and diet controlled diabetes
mellitus times four years.
ADMISSION MEDICINES: Ecotrin , Vasotec 20 mg po qd. Atenolol 50
mg po qd. Nitropatch which was to be
continued the day of admission.

alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY: His father died at the age of 48 with the
history of coronary artery disease. The mother
died at the age of 80 secondary to congestive heart failure. His
brother died of a myocardial infarction in his 60s.
ADMITTING PHYSICAL EXAM: BP 120/80. Heart rate 54. Temperature
97.2 , with 95% room air saturation.
Patient is a well-developed elderly male , lying in bed in no acute
distress. HEENT exam reveals pupils are equal , round , reactive to
light and accommodation , oropharynx is within normal limits. Neck
exam is supple with jugular venous pressure 4 cm and carotids
without bruits. Heart exam shows S1 and S2 with a positive S4 , 1/6
systolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border. Chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam is benign with
positive bowel sounds , soft and non-tender and is non-distended.
Extremities exam shows no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema , with +2
pulses bilaterally at the femoral deep tendon , and posterior tibial
sites. Rectal exam is guaiac negative. Neurological exam is
non-focal , with down-going toes bilaterally , and 2+ reflexes
bilaterally.
ADMISSION LAB: Sodium 139 , potassium 4.9 , chloride 190 ,
bicarbonate 26 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.4 , glucose
183 , white count 9.3 , hematocrit 36 with platelets of 274 , CK 219 ,
LDH 407. Urinalysis negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm 55 , axis 20 , normal intervals , biphasic V4 through V6 and 1
mm ST elevation in V5 and V6. chest x-ray was within normal
limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The physical therapy was started on Heparin
immediately after admission for presumed post
myocardial infarction angina. He underwent cardiac catheterization
the morning following admission. This demonstrated a proximal 100%
occluded left circ lesion which was easily angio-positive to 20%
residual. This was complicated by a small dissection. An LV gram
demonstrated inferior hypokinesis. The patient tolerated the
procedure well without significant decrease in hematocrit or
increase in creatinine. He was heparinized for a full forty-eight
hours post cardiac catheterization procedure. At the time of
discharge , he was ambulating. At no time during this admission did
he develop chest discomfort.
The patient was discharged to home in good condition and will be
followed by his cardiologist in one week post discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg po qd. Atenolol 50 mg po
