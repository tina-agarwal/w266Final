BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: SOB
HPI: 33 yo F with history of asthma s/p 15 intubations who was
discharged on 8/8/07 after a 5 days hospitalization for an asthma flair.
The patient reports that she was fine at home initially but that by
Saturday evening approx 2:30AM , she noted worsening SOB and gradual onset
of CP. The pain in her chest was diffuse approx 9/10 in severity without
radiation and worse with movement or inspiratory effort. The SOB did not
abate despite constant albuterol nebs and taking her dose of Prednisone
60mg that morning. She reports that her peak flow was 300 at home and in
the ED. Her baseline is 500. Consequently , she decided to return to the
SSNMC ED. In the short interim since her discharge she reports being
compliant with all of her medications. She stayed at home during this
interval without any clear precipitating trigger including exertion ,
cold air , URI , respiratory irritants such as cleaning products or
perfumes or significant emotional stress. She recently had her carpets
cleaned.

Hospital Course:
1.	Pulm: H/o severe asthma with recent asthma flare , readmitted
after one day at home with worsneing SOB despite being on Prednisone 60mg
qd and Albuteral Nebs. Acutely in the ED , the patient was stable without
significant wheezing , tachypnea , low 02 sats , use of accessory muscles
for inspiration. CXR clear. Triggers were reviewed with the patient.
There were no clear precipitating triggers to this flare other than
carpet cleaning at home. On the floor , the patient received solumedrol x
1 dose then was transitioned back to prednisone. Breath sounds were
diminished but no wheezing was evident. She was continued on duoneb and
albuterol nebulizers for SOB. Singulair was added to her medication
regimen for maximum possible pharmacological coverage. The patient's
outpatient pulmonologist was consulted , recommended continued CPAP and
outpatient follow up including PFTs. Peak flows improved from 300 to 530
on Hospital day 3. Arrangements were made for her to have CPAP at home
and for outpatient Pulmonary follow up. She will start zyrtec and
flonase for possible allergic component to asthma. On hospital day 2 , her
PPD was read as negative.
2.	CV: The patient was continued on Lisinopril and HCTZ for BP
control. Her JVP was not elevated. A routine EKG showed no changes from
previous exam and nothing to suggest cardiac ischemia. CP
appeared musculoskeletal in origin and the patient was maintained on
oxycodone for pain control.
3.	GI: The patient's bowel regimen was continued for constipation ,
and will be continued at discharge.
4.	Psych: We continued all home meds for treatment of her
schizoaffective disorder. An appointment for outpatient follow up was
made with her psychiatrist Dr. Fraunfelter .
5.	FEN: The patient was stable. ADA diet. Replete K and MG
