Discharge Date: 10/16/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Selkirk is a 49 year old woman with
history of non ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy thought to be either familial or secondary to
alcohol use who is on the transplant list and presents with
worsening CHF symptoms.
Ms. Ohlenbusch cardiac history began in 1995 when she was admitted
with worsening dyspnea. Echocardiogram at that time revealed an
ejection fraction of 15% with global hypokinesis and 3+ mitral
regurgitation. Catheterization revealed a right dominant system
with clean coronary arteries. Exercise test at that time revealed
a peak VO2 of 12.6 liters per kg per minute. IN March of 1997 , a
repeat echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with
moderate mitral regurgitation and significant left atrial
dilatation. At that time , she received tailored therapy with
Digoxin , diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In February of 1997 , she
was again hospitalized , this time with severe pancreatitis
resulting in acute renal failure , hypotension and respiratory
failure requiring intubation in the ICU. In May of 1997 , she
developed progressive dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and PND. In
March of 1998 , repeat echocardiogram revealed severe left
ventricular dilatation with an EF of 10 to 15% , global hypokinesis
and left atrial dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation. She
was hospitalized most recently in November 1999 for abdominal
discomfort thought to be secondary to worsening right heart failure
and improved with aggressive diuresis.
She has done well since then until approximately three weeks prior
to admission when she developed worsening dyspnea and intermittent
tachycardia. She reports four pillow orthopnea and three nights of
PND. She becomes short of breath walking up only five stairs , and
reports approximately three weeks of a dry cough , productive
occasionally of clear sputum. She denies fever , chills , nausea ,
vomiting or diarrhea , GI , or GU symptoms.

palpable right ventricular heave , a laterally displaced PMI and JVP
greater than 18 cm. ABDOMEN: Bowel sounds present , soft ,
non-tender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES: No
