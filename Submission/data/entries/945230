BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 60 year old female with a history of breast cancer and
chemotherapy induced CMP( EF 20% , followed by CMP clinic; on 2 L O2 at
night ) , COPD , s/p DVT now anticoagulated , HTN , afib , DM , admitted
with presumed CHF flare. Ms. Guerena was recently admitted for
CHF flare and received intravenous diuresis. She reponded well and
was discharged at a dry weight of approximately 185 pounds. Ms.
Kimmell presented on this admission with 2 days of increasing SOB ,
abdominal discomfort , nausea and vomitting. She denied increasing
edema , change in number of pillows. She did endorse PND present but
states that it is unchanged. In ED , the patient was afebile , inital
ly with oxygen saturation in the high 90's on 2 L. BP 154/84. BNP was
greater than 3000. CXR showed pulmonary edema. Abdominal CT was
obtained due to concern for the patients abdominal pain and showed
an engorged , fatty liver , ascites , pleural effusions ( not seen
on CXR ). A surgical consult was obtained and the surgeons felt the
patients abdominal pain was not surgical in nature but rather secondary
to CHF.
Hospital Course:
1 ) Cardiovascular: a ) Pump- CHF exacerbation. We diuresed the patient
initially with intravenous lasix until her respiratory status
imroved and the patient was able to maintain good oxygen saturation on
room air. At the time of discharge her oxygen saturation on room air
was in the high 90's and was between 94-96 % with ambulation. We
continued the patient's home doses of beta blocker , angiotension
receptor blocker and statin. The patient was again encouraged to
adhere to a low-salt diet and weight herself daily. The patient will be
discharged on Torsemide 100 mg po q am and 50 mg po q pm , a regimine t
has worked will for the patient in the past. She will f/uw iht the
Naiimo Hospital CHF Clinic ( Harold Gohring ) on 5/10 at 10:30 am. The
patient will be followed by Rangespo Chica Li VNA who will assist in her CHF
monitoring and assess her for home PT. b ) Rhythm- The
pa tient is know to have frequent PVCs and non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia which was agian noted on this admission on telemetry.
She was asymptomatic with the NSVT and remains hemodynamically stable.
We obtained an electrophysiology consult to evaluate the need for an
AICD or biventricular pacing. The patietns electrolytes and magnesium
were monitored and rempleted and she was maintained on a beta blocker.
On 10/7 the EP service placed a VVI/R ICD device without complications.
It was interogated ont he day of d/c and the patietn was provided with
written instructions from the EP service for d/c. She will follow-up
with the Dr. Cradduck on 6/22 as described. c ) Ischemia:
Patient with a history of CAD.
ED initially concerned for a myocardial infarction. She was ruled o
ut for an MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3. Serial EKG's
were unchanged. We continued the patient on ASA , beta blocker , s
tatin and ARB. 2 )Heme: Ms. Egerton has a history of DVT , therapeutic
on coumadin at the time of admission. We did decreased her
dose while being treated with levofloxacin. In addition her coumadin
was held for her EP procedure. At the time of d/c she will be
resuming her regular dose of coumadin and should follow-up at her
usualy JMC lab to have her INR checked on Thursday 5/10 .  3 )ID: +UA on
admission treated for three days with levofloxacin. ( Last day was
1/16/4 ). Her cx grew citrobacter which was sensitive to levo. Repeat
UA was negative. 4 ) GI: Abdominal discomfort presumably due
to hepatic congestion. Abdominal CT showed no acute surgical process.
Abdominal pain was resolved with diuresis. She does have a
chronic elevated alk phos which may be related to her
sarcoid. 6 )Endocrine: Continued
levoxyl for the patient's hypothyroid. Pt with IDDM. We decreased
her lantus dose from 50 u sc to 30 u sc on admission as po
intake was initially low. Pt can resume regular
insulin dose after discharge when she resumes her
outpatient eating habits. 7 ) General: PT consulted to assist in
prevention deconditioning while in the hospital. VNA will evaluate need
for home PT services.
