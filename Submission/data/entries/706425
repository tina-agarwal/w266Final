Discharge Date: 0/22/2006
ATTENDING: CZACHOR , FREDDY MD , MBA
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
The diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is pleural
effusions.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of congestive
heart failure , coronary artery disease , atrial fibrillation ,
chronic renal insufficiency , and non-small cell carcinoma of the
left lung , status post resection in 1997. He presents with
shortness of breath. He lives in a nursing home and was
diagnosed with pneumonia more than three weeks prior to
admission. The pneumonia , per report , was bilateral , left
greater than right. He was started on a 10-day course of
levofloxacin , which he completed. He subsequently developed C.
diff colitis and was treated with Flagyl. Three days prior to
the present admission , he noticing increased shortness of breath ,
worsened with any movement in bed. A chest x-ray at the nursing
home reportedly showed an increased opacity in the right lower
base , concerning for recurrent pneumonia. For this , he was
restarted on levofloxacin. On the day of admission , his oxygen
saturation dropped to 77% on room air , with improvement to the
mid 90's on 3 liters of oxygen. He noted a mild dry cough. Her
denied headache , dizziness , chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominal
discomfort , or dysuria. His son reported that he has mild
orthopnea at baseline , unchanged in recent days. Notably , he was
admitted to the Sho Hospital in 2/15 for subacute shortness of
breath , thought to be due to a CHF exacerbation , treated with
Lasix diuresis. An echocardiogram at that time showed an
ejection fraction of 55% , with mild left atrial enlargement , and
mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , along with
inferobasal wall hypokinesis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
As above in the history of present illness , along with
constipation , pain with movement of the right knee and right heel
ulcer , status post skin graft.

LV hypertrophy.
2. Coronary artery disease , status post multiple angioplasties

5. Diabetes mellitus , diagnosed more than 20 years ago , on
insulin.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency.
7. Peripheral vascular disease , status post angioplasty in 2006.

FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for a father with diabetes and a brother with heart
disease.
SUMMARY OF THE HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Shortness of breath: The patient initially presented with
shortness of breath , saturating 77% on room air. He was noted on
chest x-ray to have moderate bilateral effusions. The effusions
were likely secondary to congestive heart failure , although
pneumonia with parapneumonic effusions could not be excluded.
Given that he was afebrile with a decreasing white count and not
increasingly hypoxic , parapneumonic effusions were considered
less likely compared to worsening CHF. Given the concern for
CHF , he was given Lasix 40 mg IV approximately one to two doses a
day for large volume diuresis , with a goal of total body balance
of 2 liters negative per day. Over the course of his
hospitalization , his bilateral effusions improved , although there
were small effusions noted on the chest x-ray at the time of
discharge. His oxygen requirement decreased , and on the day of
discharge , he was saturating 97-98% on 1 liter. Of note , the
patient was brought to ultrasound for a planned guided
thoracocentesis , but the effusion sites were small such that in
the context of this clinical improvement , thoracocentesis was
deferred. He was maintained initially as well with vancomycin
and levofloxacin , although the vancomycin was discontinued after
four days , and the levofloxacin was discontinued on discharge ( of
note , he received 10 days total of levofloxacin starting from
7/24/2006 at his nursing home ). Echocardiogram noted an
ejection fraction of 55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy ,
consistent with diastolic dysfunction. The etiology of his
congestive heart failure and pleural effusions was therefore
thought to be atrial fibrillation with RVR. In terms of follow
up , he needs daily weights; if he gains greater than 2 pounds
over 24 hours , it is recommended that his Lasix dose be doubled
for that day. As a discharge , he is being sent out on Lasix 40
mg p.o. daily.
2. Cardiovascular:
a. Ischemia: The patient initially had a small troponin leak
0.32 , which was thought secondary to demand ischemia from atrial
fibrillation with RVR. For this , he was briefly started on a
heparin drip. Subsequently , cardiac enzymes trended down. The
patient was maintained on Coumadin and aspirin 81 mg , along with
Zocor and Questran for hyperlipidemia. On hospital day #3 to #4 ,
telemetry noted pauses. EKG showed in addition to pausing , new
T-wave inversions in anterior precordial leads , associated with
ST depression. This is thought to be either due to ischemia or
digitalis toxicity. His digoxin levels measured 1.3 to 1.4 , so
digoxin was held , with improving in pausing , but no change in
T-wave inversions. In discussions with his outpatient
cardiologist , it was thought that his T-wave inversions could
possible be ischemic , although the appropriate course of action
was not to pursue further anticoagulation or evaluation for
catheterization , given the patient's other medical issues. He
was maintained on Coumadin , aspirin , Zocor , Questran , and
Lopressor.
b. Rhythm: The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation
throughout his hospitalization and was rate controlled with
Lopressor 37.5 mg t.i.d. ( increased from a home dose of 25 mg
t.i.d. ). He was also maintained on Coumadin 2 mg daily for
anticoagulation. On admission , there was a report that he had
runs of ventricular tachycardia and he was placed on a lidocaine
drip for several hours in the emergency department. No
documentation regarding telemetry strips or QRS morphologies
could be obtained to verify this rhythm , however. In addition ,
throughout his hospitalization , he had occasional runs
nonsustained VT and SVT. As discussed above , he was thought to
have mild digoxin toxicity given pausing with a digoxin level of
1.3 to 1.4. His digoxin was therefore held and subsequent
improvement in pausing was noted. Of note , on discharge , his
digoxin has been discontinued. His primary care physician and
cardiologist should consider whether or not to restart digoxin as
an outpatient.
c. Pump: The patient was aggressively diuresed with 40 mg IV of
Lasix approximately one to two times per day , for a total
diuresis of roughly negative 9 liters over the course of his
hospitalization. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy , consistent with
diastolic dysfunction. As discussed above , he will be discharged
on Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily. Note , as mentioned above , if he gains
greater than 2 pounds over a 24-hour period , his Lasix dose
should be doubled for that day.
3. C. diff: The patient had a positive C. diff as an inpatient.
He had been on Flagyl , which was started at the nursing home for
a prior diagnosis of C. diff. Because of persistent bowel
movements , he was switched to p.o. vancomycin 250 mg q.i.d. , and
upon discharge , he was started on a probiotic ( Saccharomyces
boulardii 250 mg q.i.d. ) to replenish his gut flora. We will
recommend that he continue p.o. vancomycin and the probiotic for
10 days after his diarrheal symptoms have resolved. If these
symptoms do not improve on the regimen within the few days
following discharge from Wood Rehab , we will recommend consider
adding metronidazole IV and getting an infectious disease
consult.
4. Diabetes: The patient had several bouts of hypoglycemia
during the course of his hospitalization. These were appeared to
be related to poor p.o. intake. His Lantus was changed to 15
daily , and he was covered with a NovoLog sliding scale. After
the changes , his fingersticks ranged in mid 100's.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH was low with a normal free
T4 suggestive of sick euthyroid. He was continued on Synthroid
25 mcg daily.
6. Musculoskeletal: Given the patient's creatinine clearance of
less than 50 , his colchicine dose for gout was switched from 0.6
mg b.i.d. to 0.6 mg daily. We continued his Neurontin for
neuropathic pain , and Tylenol for right knee osteoarthritis. He
was seen by Plastic Surgery registered nurse who recommended
Panafil with dressing for his right heel ulcer. He also has a
small ulcer developing on his left big toe , which will need close
observation as follow up.
