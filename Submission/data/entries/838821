HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
GI: The patient was admitted to the hospital for likely UGI bleed given
significant anemia , guaic positive maroon stools and elevated BUN. She
was transfused with 2 U PRBC initially , placed NPO , IVF and GI consult
was obtained. GI took her to endoscopy and did upper endoscopy on
morning of June .  They found a friable ulcer located at an anastomosis
site from her previous bypass surgery. No active bleeding and blood
vessels were identified at the area. This represents the likely source
of her bleed. 2 more units of blood were ordered to keep goal over 30
but she only bumped to 26.6 from 20 after total of four units initially.
It is possible the blood was drawn distal to where IVF was adminitered
and there could have a been a dilutional effect. One more unit was given
for a total of five which put her over 30. Her HCT was monitored and
stayed stable at 30 after that for the remainder of her hospitalization.
She was placed on BID PPI. Her asprin and plavix were held on admission
as well as her BP meds.
---
CV: She does have a history of CAD s/p MI and coronary stents. She
had a negative MiBi a month prior to admission. A set of enzymes upon
admission were negative , another troponin was negative on the
1 of March .  Her HTN meds were held upon admission. Her goal HCT is &gt;30
given CAD. She is on digoxin for question of afib which was on
hold during admission. Cardiac telemetry revealed no events. She had one
episode of "chest pain" on the night of the 1 of March which was actually
located in the epigastric region. An EKG was performed at that time
which was unchanged from the admission EKG. She was HD stable without
event on telemetry. She received NTG tabs X3 without any relief and a
follow up troponin was negative for the third time.
---
PAIN: She was continued on current pain regimen.
---
PPX: Teds , Pneumoboots
---
ENDO: She was continued home Levothyroxine
---
GI: She was constipated during admission and had not had a bowel
movement despite very aggressive regimen. Her abd became slightly
distended. The patient then started to refuse bowel meds as she was
getting prepared for discharge and was afraid to have movement on ride
home. She agreed to maintain agressive regimen at home and was instructed
to follow up with PCP or ER if she can not produce results within a day.
---
She was stable for discharge on March and discharged with instructions
to follow up with PCP within two weeks or sooner if lightheadedness ,
bloody or black stools , vomiting , chest pain or other concerns.
