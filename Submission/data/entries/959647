laminectomy and washout for infected seroma and washout. She's had
frequent admissions for atypical chest pain at multiple
hospitals. On DOA , noted that at exactly 1:30 PM had sudden onset of
sscp 10/10 which she described as someone sitting on her chest and
stabbing her. This pain lasted through 2 episodes of nitro sl , a 3rd
dose in the ED , and was finally relieved by morphine.
**In ED: 60 , 18 124/71 , 99%RA given morphine 2mg IV x 3 , then morphine
4 mg IV x 3 , then lopressor x 1 , then xanax x 1. Pain relieved 4 hours

MIBI results 5/12/07 : normal perfusion and normal EF , area of abnormal

*****
IMPRESSION: Ms. Denna is a 58F with a h/o diabetes , CAD s/p stent to
LAD in 2004 , permanent pacemaker for ?afib/SSS , who was admitted with
chest pain that she described as exactly like her MI w/ ckmb elevated.
However she also stated that her chest pain had never really resolved
after her cath in 2004. Complicating factors include multiple admissions
for chest pain , chronic pain syndrome , and narcotic dependence.
**CV: i: Initially there was concern b/c her CKMB fraction was
elevated , and there were T wave inversions in V3-V6 that seemed new in a
non-paced EKG that was captured. She received one dose of therapeutic
lovenox , which was discontinued when she ruled out. She continued to
complain of chest pain throughout her admission , which typically would be
relieved by morphine. Suspicion for cardiac chest pain is low , but a
MIBI was obtained to determine her baseline. The MIBI
revealed normal perfusion and normal EF. There was abnormal uptake in the
left axilla , and obtaining a mammogram was recommended.
**NEURO: High pain med requirements secondary to chronic pain , and
surgical interventions. She was maintained on regimen as outlined in
last d/c summary , including MS Contin 30mg BID and oxycodone 30mg po q4h
prn pain. Pain service was called but did not see her in house and
recommended outpatient follow up with either rheumatology or psychiatry
re her chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. Bladder training can be
considered given her urinary incontinence.
**ORTHO: recent procedure ( 4/13 L3-L5 laminectomy for cauda equina ,
I&amp;D for seroma 3/28 .  Orthopedics followed while she was in house. She
was noted to have a small protrusion likely muscle herniation in the site
of the recent procedure. Dr. Loendorf ID saw the patient and will see
her in follow up. She is to continue the vancomycin through 6/24/07 , and
then the vancomycin and the PICC should be discontinued. She will follow up
with Dr. Dininger on August .
