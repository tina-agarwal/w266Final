breath. He had been bedridden for several months with right heel
ulcerations , and was scheduled to undergo operative repair of
this ulceration , however , he began to feel short of breath one

upon presentation. He also described dull nonradiating chest pain
with shortness of breath , which had resolved at the time the
patient arrived in the Emergency Department. He also had
increased right knee pain for one week , presumably due to a combination of gout

hypertrophy , AFib , digitalis changes.
ASSESSMENT:
An 80-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease ,
AFib , peripheral vascular disease , gout in the setting of CHF
exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Medicine Service
where he was cared for until 9/12/06 .  During this time , the
patient's lasix was increased to 80 mg IV q.a.m. an attempt to
diurese the patient with a goal I/O of negative 1 liter a
day. He was continued on his digoxin and metoprolol. He was
ruled out for cardiac event with three negative sets of cardiac
enzymes. He was started on a bowel regimen of Colace , Senna and
MiraLax p.r.n. due to constipation. Regarding his right knee
pain , the Rheumatology Service was consulted on 1/15/06 and
recommended two views of his right knee , which were significant
for a small effusion and severe osteoarthritis. Recommended
Tylenol , opioids for pain and continued colchicine.
Intraarticular steroids were discussed , however , deferred until
after surgical intervention. A Foley catheter was placed to
monitor his I's and O's closely. He was also started on
tamsulosin for his BPH. Regarding his hematologic status , his
Coumadin was initially continued , however , due to a planned
Plastic Surgery intervention , starting on 1/15/06 .  The patient
did receive several doses of p.o. vitamin K preoperatively , which
brought his INR down to 1.3 prior to surgery. Thus on 9/12/06 ,
Mr. Rochat was taken to the operating room for debridement of his
right Achilles ulceration and split thickness skin graft.
Postoperatively , he was transferred to the Plastic Surgery
Service. On postop day #1 , the Rheumatology Service was again
consulted for persistent right knee pain. They elected at that
time to inject steroids intraarticularly. There was not enough
fluid for aspiration , however.
POSTOPERATIVE HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Neurologically: The patient tolerated p.r.n. Dilaudid. He was
continued on his doses of Neurontin and Zoloft.
Cardiovascularly: He has continued on digoxin and metoprolol for
rate control of his atrial fibrillation. He was also continued
on 80 mg daily of Lasix , which was decreased to 40 mg after
recommendations from the Medicine Service. The patient did have
an episode of bradycardia into the 30s on 5/24/06 , which was
believed to be secondary to excessive beta blockade. Thus his
Lopressor dose was decreased to 25 mg t.i.d.
Respiratory: The patient has been saturating well on room air
without pulmonary complaints.
GI: The patient has been tolerating his diet and having bowel
movements.
GU: The patient's Foley catheter was removed on 5/24/06 .  The
patient voided without complication. He has continued his
tamsulosin.
Hematologically: He was placed back on his home dose of Coumadin
and his aspirin was restarted. His hematocrit was stable
postoperatively at 27.8 and has continued to be stable and is
currently 29.4. He has also been maintained on subcutaneous
heparin t.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis.
ID: The patient was started on clindamycin postoperatively for
graft prophylaxis. He has been afebrile and his white count has
been normal and is currently 7.8.
Endocrine: He has been maintained on Lantus and NovoLog before
meals and a NovoLog sliding scale , which have been titrated
according to his blood sugars. His insulin regimen is currently ,
Lantus 32 units daily , and NovoLog sliding scale , and NovoLog 4
units before meals.
Rheumatologically: The patient has been followed by the
Rheumatology Service for right knee gout. The intraarticular
steroid injection improved his pain minimally and thus the
Rheumatology Service is currently planning on injection of
Synvisc intraarticularly. The Rheumatology Service also
recommended a right knee MRI , which was obtained ( showed severe OA , gouty
changes ). Regarding his wound , his dressings were taken
down on 9/23/06 and his skin graft appeared to be taking well.
His donor site is clean , dry , and intact as well and he is
receiving heat lamp treatments daily. Regarding his mobility ,
the patient has been limited significantly due to his severe
right knee pain. The physical therapist will work with the
patient on 9/23/06 , which is the first day that his skin graft
dressings have been taken down.
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:
The patient is alert and oriented x3 in no apparent distress
while he is resting. When he attempts to move his right lower
extremity , he does complain of significant right knee pain.
Cardiovascular is irregularly irregular. His lungs are clear
superiorly and slightly decreased in the bases. His abdomen is
soft , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: His right leg
donor site is clean , dry , and intact with Xeroform in place. His
right lower extremity skin graft was taking well with Xeroform in
place. His right knee is swollen and tender to palpation. The
patient has pain with passive and active range of motion.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient should follow up with Dr. Mammoccio in one to two weeks.
He should also follow up with his primary care physician in one
to two weeks. The patient should have his INRs checked two to
three times per week with goal INR of 2-3 for treatment of AFib.
He should also have heat lamp treatment to his split thickness
skin graft donor site 20 minutes t.i.d. until the Xeroform falls
off. The split thickness skin graft site should be changed daily
with Xeroform and Kerlix dressing. The patient is currently
scheduled for an MRI while inpatient , however , if he does not
receive his MR while in house , he needs to have an outpatient MRI
scheduled. Please refer to the discharge summary for final
details including a final list of medications and the plans
