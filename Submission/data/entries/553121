ATTENDING: PUSSER , ROLLAND M.D.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest and left arm pain , and left arm paresthesias.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 47-year-old female with a past medical history , which
includes HIV positive , hepatitis C positive , seizures , and
neuropathy , who presented complaining of left hand paresthesias
followed by left hand pain that marches proximally up her left
arm and affecting her left shoulder and chest. Along with these
symptoms , she has associated shortness of breath , palpitations ,
lightheadedness , diaphoresis , and nausea. The patient notes that
these symptoms have been occurring approximately five times per
week over the past two months. She has notified her PCP of these
events , however , the etiology has never been identified. Of
note , the patient states that these symptoms have increased in
frequency since having two syncopal events , which occurred three
days prior to admission.
Regarding syncope , the patient recalls her first loss of
consciousness episode occurring three days ago in her bedroom.
There were no antecedent symptoms. She came back to
consciousness while on the ground , called out for help and her
daughter came immediately. There was no witnessed seizure
activity , no postictal confusion , no tongue trauma nor was there
any incontinence. A second episode of syncope occurred two days
prior to arrival while the patient was standing in the bathroom.
There was some preceding lightheadedness this time. The
post-event characteristics were the same. Again , the patient was
found by her son when she called out for help.
The patient denies prior history of syncopal events , however , she
does have a lifelong history of seizures and has not been taking
her Keppra for approximately a year , as her prescription has ran
out and she has failed to keep follow-up appointments with her
primary neurologist , Dr. Loock Both the patient and her
daughter note that she usually has postictal confusion and that
these syncopal events did not fit that description. Furthermore ,
these episodes did not feel like her occasional hypoglycemic
episodes. Unfortunately , the patient's blood sugars were not
obtained during these syncopal events.
Of note , the patient recently started Flexeril to treat chronic
low back pain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient admits stable three-pillow orthopnea , but new
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no lower extremity edema , weight
loss or increased abdominal girth. The patient has stable
four-block ambulation limited by dyspnea. She has had notable
weight loss as she has decreased in dress size from 18-14 over
the past nine months. She denies fevers or chills.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
HIV positive , drug-seeking behavior , parotitis , migraine
headaches , anxiety and panic , depression , hepatitis C , seizures ,
neuropathy , pancreatitis , abnormal Pap smear , diabetes mellitus ,
cerebral aneurysm , herpes simplex type 1 , and chronic low back
pain.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 172/80 , heart rate 82 ,
respiratory rate 20 , and saturating 100% on room air. This is a
middle-aged woman appearing older than stated age , complaining of
left hand pain , but otherwise appears comfortable. She has a
disconjugate gaze , has only light vision in her left eye.
Sclerae are anicteric. Oropharynx is benign. She had no oral
ulcers or thrush. Neck is supple , without cervical
lymphadenopathy , no JVD , and no carotid bruits. Lungs are clear
to auscultation. Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no murmurs ,
rubs or gallops. Abdomen was obese , soft , nondistended , and
nontender with questionable splenic fullness , no clubbing ,
cyanosis or edema. She had a 4 x 4 ecchymosis on her left
shoulder and a 2 x 2 scab over her left elbow. The soft tissue
extending from the left shoulder to left elbow was tender to
palpation as was the left chest. She had decreased sensation of
bilateral lower extremities and left. Aside from a disconjugate
gaze , cranial nerves were intact. Motor exam was intact. Gait
was slightly wide-based , but sufficient without cane. Negative
Romberg , negative pronator drift , and no dysmetria on
finger-to-nose bilateral , and deep tendon reflexes were 2+
throughout.
ADMISSION LABORATORY VALUES:
Sodium 138 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 103 , CO2 28 , BUN 13 ,
creatinine 0.7 , glucose 179 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 1.6 , ALT 35 ,

ADMISSION DATA:
Chest x-ray was within normal limits. EKG was normal sinus
rhythm without ischemic change. CAT scan of the head was within
normal limits. Left shoulder and arm plain films were negative
for fracture or dislocation.
IMPRESSION:
This is a 47-year-old female with a history significant for HIV ,
diabetes , questionable cerebral aneurysm , and seizure disorder
( not taking Keppra for the past year ) , who recently had two
syncopal events without prodrome and without postictal state
( thus unlikely a seizure in etiology ) , who presented for
evaluation of left arm paresthesias and chest pain , with
associated diaphoresis , shortness of breath and nausea , which has
been intermittently occurring over the past two months.
During this admission , the patient had frequent recurrences of
her left arm and chest pain symptoms , which were related to
syncopal events. Thus , the medical team does not think that
these two issues are related. The patient underwent an extensive
syncopal evaluation , however , the etiology was never identified.
The etiology of the patient's left arm and chest symptoms and
syndromes also was not identified during this admission , however ,
the medical team suspects it may be related to a cervical spinous
process , potentially arthritis , disc herniation or nerve root
impingement. Please see below for more details. The remainder
of the dictation will be divided into system:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient underwent an extensive
cardiovascular evaluation , all of which was negative.
a. Pump: Given the patient's history of HIV and taking
antiretroviral , there was a concern about associated
cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram that was performed was completely
within normal limits. The patient did not exhibit signs of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea during this admission.
Dyspnea on exertion could be related to decondition.
b. Rhythm: The patient's telemetry history on 2/23/2006 was
notable for a nonsustained 5-beat run of wide complex tachycardia
with rates in the 150's. This was immediately followed by a
nonsustained 4-beat run of narrow complex tachycardia.
Cardiology consult was placed to review the telemetry strip and
to assess for referral to EP Service for potential AICD. Given
the negative echocardiogram , the Card Service wanted to rule out
ischemia-induced arrhythmia , so a MIBI was performed , and the
patient was started on low-dose beta-blocker and aspirin. The
adenosine MIBI was within normal limits. The telemetry strip was
reviewed by the EP Service and diagnosed the patient with
nonsustained SVT with aberrancy. The Card Service then advised
that there was no need for AICD. They stated that if tolerated ,
the beta-blocker could be continued and that the patient should
be set up as an outpatient for a loop recorder. This will be
coordinated through the patient's PCP. Of note , after starting
metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d. , the patient had occasional bradycardia to
the high 40's. Thus , it was determined that this medication
should be discontinued as it may be impairing the patient's
exercise tolerance.
c. Ischemia: Coronary disease risk factors include diabetes and
family history. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction , had
no ischemic change on her EKG , and had a negative MIBI. No
further workup for coronary artery disease was indicated. A
lipid panel was completely within normal limits and suggesting
treatment was not indicated.
d. Miscellaneous: On 8/12/2006 , the patient was evaluated for
one of her left arm and chest pain events. The patient was noted
to be diaphoretic and complained of nausea and shortness of
breath. The symptoms occurred while the patient was lying in
bed. Upon arrival by the team , her blood pressure was 90/56 ,
heart rate was 56 , she had poor pallor , was diaphoretic , and
described chest pain radiating up and down her arm. EKG in
telemetry during the event was normal sinus rhythm with any acute
ST or T-wave changes. The event spontaneously resolved in less
than 15 minutes without medical intervention.
2. Neuro: The patient has a history of convulsive seizures and
has been noncompliant with Keppra for the past 12 months because
she failed to keep neuro appointment with Dr. Sconiers and has
been unable to obtain refills. Per the patient , her recent
syncopal events were without prodrome and without postictal
state. Thus , were unlikely prior seizures and unlikely seizure
in focus. An EEG was performed during this admission and
demonstrated no definite focal or epileptiform features. Keppra
was restarted at 250 mg b.i.d. with a goal to increase to 500 mg
b.i.d. after 7 days and to 750 mg after another week. There was
a question of a history of cerebral aneurysm , diagnosed at an
outside facility , which was never confirmed by Tonfay Medical Center imaging. MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck
obtained this admission was negative for hemorrhage , mass , edema ,
hydrocephalus , infarction , and negative for abnormal enhancement.
There was no aneurysm high-flow AVM or stenosis found , and MRA
of the neck had no significant abnormality. The patient's
neurologist , Dr. Klez , was aware of this admission. A
follow-up appointment has been made.
3. Endocrine: History of diabetes type II , hemoglobin A1c of
6.1 , reflects excellent outpatient glycemic control , however , the
patient reports becoming diaphoretic with normal glycemic levels
between 80 and 100. Given recent weight loss without glyburide
dose adjustment , the medical team decreased glyburide to 2.5 mg
daily for the patient to begin upon discharge. During this
admission , the all oral agents were held and the patient was
treated with the Ryo Hospital Medical Center insulin protocol.
4. Infectious disease: The patient has a history of HIV
positive , CD4 count on 1/21/2006 was 217. The viral load was
less than assay. The patient continued on Truvada and Lexiva.
The patient complained of dysuria on 2/6/2006. Urinalysis was
ordered , but symptoms resolved before specimen could be sent the
lab.
5. Pain: History of chronic pain and lumbar spine herniations.
The methadone dose of 155 mg was confirmed with the outpatient
clinic. No additional regular narcotics were given during this
admission.
6. Heme: The patient has chronic pancytopenia. She has a
normocytic normochromic anemia with normal iron studies , B12 and
folate , and a low reticulocyte index consistent with anemia of
chronic disease , likely from HIV immunosuppression.
7. Miscellaneous: The patient was screened by the Physical
Therapy Service who recommended a home safety evaluation. This
will be coordinated to the Tlandgilb O Visiting Nurses Association.
Given the liability and predictability of events , the team
implemented a 24-hour urine collection to assess for
pheochromocytoma. The results of the studies are pending at the
time of this discharge. The patient may have autonomic
dysregulation as part of her diabetes. Alternatively , the
medical team speculates that the patient may have cervical spinal
arthritis , lumbar herniation or nerve root impingement
contributing to these symptoms. Of note , the patient states that
these episodes had occurred more frequently inpatient and they
were at home. It was until the day of discharge that it was
noted that the patient was not receiving her Klonopin 1 mg q.i.d.
as she had prior to admission. In fact , she has only received
three doses of Klonopin over a six-day period. It is unclear
what role anxiety is playing into these events. On the day of
discharge , the patient stated that she was making arrangements to
see an orthopedic specialist at Laly County Health for
evaluation of her cervical spine.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Syncope , not otherwise specified.
2. Left arm pain/left chest pain/left arm paresthesias ( not
otherwise specified ).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Ecotrin 81 mg daily , clonazepam 1 mg q.6 h. p.r.n. , Imodium one
to two tablets q.i.d. p.r.n. for diarrhea , Truvada one tablet
p.o. daily , Lexiva 1400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg daily ,
Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. for 14 doses and then 750 mg b.i.d.
indefinitely , methadone 155 mg daily , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d. ,
Zoloft 300 mg daily , trazodone 100 mg at bedtime p.r.n. , and
Zofran 4 mg daily p.r.n. for nausea.
MEDICAL FOLLOW UP:
On 2/25/2006 , the patient is scheduled to see her PCP , Dr. Les Orosco On 7/10/2006 , she is scheduled to see her psychiatrist ,
Dr. Damien Scherzer On 9/18/2006 , she is scheduled to see
her Infectious Disease , Dr. Marion Callais On 0/14/2006 , she is
scheduled to see her neurologist , Dr. Shane Bemberry In
addition , the patient is going to be followed by the Na Riventtortonlis Jo VNA
who will do a medication reconciliation and home safety
evaluation.
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Take medications as listed , clarify discrepancies with your
PCP. This means stop taking Flexeril , ____ glyburide has been
changed to 2.5 mg , and low-dose aspirin has been started.
2. If you faint again , you should return to the ER for
evaluation.
3. If your chest pain symptoms recur and persist longer than the
typical course , call your PCP and/or return to the emergency
room.
4. Make an appointment with the Smill Memorial Hospital to evaluate
the cause of her left arm symptoms.
5. Check your blood sugars before meals and at bedtime , record
and bring your results to your follow-up appointment.
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PCP:
1. Please arrange for a loop monitor.
2. Follow up on a 24-hour urine studies assessing for
pheochromocytoma.
3. Adjust the patient's diabetes management as needed.
