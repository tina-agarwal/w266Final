HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65 year old woman
with insulin requiring diabetes
mellitus , hypertension , and known coronary artery disease who
presented on the day of admission after having a fall at home. She
was noted in the emergency room to have new ECG changes. The
patient was recently catheterized in March of 1998 at which time
she was found to have a 100% left anterior descending artery
lesion , a 100% right coronary artery lesion , and a 40% obtuse
marginal 1 lesion. Her left anterior descending artery and right
coronary artery territories were being served by collaterals and
the decision was made to manage her medically on enteric coated
aspirin , Atenolol 50 mg q.d. , Lisinopril 30 mg q.d. , and Pravacid
at 20 mg q.d. Her Bumex dose was recently increased from 1 to 2
q.d. on 8/16/98 . She was recently admitted from 11/19/98 to 5/11/98 
for increasing shortness of breath and some chest pain and had
catheterization with results as described above. She was
discharged to home on an increase in her medical regimen. Her last
echocardiogram was done in February of 1997 and this showed a
moderately dilated left ventricle with septal akinesis , inferior
hypokinesis , and an ejection fraction of 35%. Her right
ventricular size and function were normal. There was mild left
atrial enlargement , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspid
regurgitation , and trivial aortic insufficiency. Since discharge
she has been followed in Tauershingdeneers Hospital by Dr.
Goodfield , as well as by Dr. Adamyan of cardiology. Her Bumex dose as
described above was increased on 8/16/98 because of fluid overload.
Of note , she has had very poor glycemic control over the two months
prior to admission with blood sugars in the 300 to 400 range. Her
last A1C was 12.3 on 8/16/98 . It had been 6.0 on 8/27/97 . On the
day of admission after standing up to get her insulin , she felt
lightheaded and fell backwards , landing on her coccyx into a chair
but the chair fell backwards and so she fell backwards as well.
She reported that for two or three days prior to admission she had
been having some lightheadedness. She denied any visual changes or
weakness , loss of consciousness or head injury. She denied any
seizure or seizure history or loss of urine. She was unable to get
up and called for help and an ambulance brought her to the
emergency room department.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She reported occasional diarrhea and
constipation. She had no fever or chills. No
cough. No urinary symptoms. She also denied any dietary
indiscretion or non-compliance with her insulin. She reports that
she has chest pain approximately two times per week but denied
having any chest pain on the day of admission.
MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 50 mg
q.d. , Isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , Lisinopril 30 mg q.d. ,
Bumex 2 mg q.d. since 8/16/98 , Pravastatin 20 mg q.d. , Omeprazole
20 mg q.d. , insulin NPH 75 q.a.m. and 35 q.p.m. , regular 25 q.a.m.
and 15 q.p.m. , Trazadone 100 mg qhs p.r.n. , Allegra 60 mg b.i.d. ,
Proventil 2 b.i.d.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease as noted above.
Hypertension. Obesity. Insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus. Depression. Gout. Chronic hearing loss
requiring hearing aids bilaterally. History of cholecystectomy
and appendectomy in past.
FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone and has a visiting nurse.
She use to work in housekeeping at the
Mo Dessimed Memorial Hospital .  She has a remote history of
smoking but does not drink any alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is an obese woman in no acute distress.
Temperature 98.3 degrees , pulse 95 , blood
pressure 109/63. Her room air saturation was 95%. She was not
orthostatic. HEENT: Unremarkable. Jugular venous distension
difficult to assess because of her habitus. Heart: Regular rate
and rhythm. S1 and S2 distant. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
Lungs clear with exception of question of some rales at bases.
This was also difficult to assess due to poor inspiratory effort.
Abdomen: Benign. Extremities: 1+ edema at feet only.
Neurologic: Nonfocal. The patient was an appropriate historian
but had difficulty hearing some of the questions.
LABORATORY DATA: Normal set of electrolytes with BUN 58 ,
creatinine 2.4. Blood sugar 435. Anion gap 16.
Arterial blood gas on room air: pH 7.4 , pCO2 40 , pO2 69 , oxygen
saturation 94%. The first CK done in the emergency room department
was 194. An ACE test was positive but beta hydroxybutyrate was
negative with triponin of 0. WBC 7 , hematocrit 37 , platelet count
167. Coagulase was within normal limits. Urinalysis was
remarkable for 3+ glucose with no ketones , 1+ esterace , negative
nitrite , 20 to 25 white blood cells , 2 to 3 red blood cells , 2+
bacteria , and 1+ yeast. Urine culture was sent and came back
negative. ECG was normal sinus rhythm at rate of 92 with intervals
of 0.15 , 0.1 , and 0.324 , an axis of 32 , and left atrial
enlargement. There were new T-wave inversions in leads 1 and L
with biphasic T-waves in V4 through V6 compared with her ECG of
1/14/97 .
ASSESSMENT: In short , this is a 65 year old woman with known two
vessel coronary artery disease , hypertension , and
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus under poor glycemic control
recently , now presenting with hyperglycemia , dehydration , and new
ECG changes suggestive of lateral ischemia. She was admitted for
rule out of myocardial infarction and monitoring.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted and
placed on a cardiac monitor. She ruled out for
myocardial infarction by enzymes and her ECG continued to show new
lateral T-wave changes. There was no evolution or change in these
throughout the course of the admission. On 8/0/98 the patient
underwent a Dobutamine MIBI study after discussion with her primary
care physician and cardiologist , Dr. Ginkel , who felt that this
would be a helpful study , given her difficult history and known
underlying coronary artery disease. The results of the Dobutamine
study were that she had no ECG changes and the MIBI images showed
lateral and inferior infarcts but no active ischemia.
Over the course of the first couple of days of the admission , the
patient's blood pressure was noted to be lower than her usual
baseline. Her diuretics were held with the thought that her
elevated creatinine , lightheadedness , and general malaise were
probably due to dehydration , given that her Bumex dose had recently
been increased. She was gently hydrated with a total of about 3
liters and her blood pressure increased somewhat. A follow-up
chest x-ray was done which did not show any evidence of congestive
heart failure. The patient had no other active cardiac issues
during this admission.
Renal: At the time of the admission the patient's creatinine was
2.5. It subsequently bumped to a maximum of 2.9 in the setting of
her dehydration. Her blood pressure medications were held and she
was gently rehydrated. With this treatment , her creatinine
returned to its baseline of approximately 1.5 to 1.6. At the time
of admission there was some question as to whether she might have a
urinary tract infection given her urinalysis; however , a urine
culture came back negative. The white blood cells in her urine on
admission were not present on a subsequent specimen which was
obtained by straight catheterization and the thought was that the
initial pyuria was probably related to vaginal candidiasis.
Pulmonary: Over the course of the first three or four days of
admission , the patient developed a somewhat increasing oxygen
requirement for unclear reasons. Her need for oxygen waxed and
waned but , because of her habitus and her general complaints of
dyspnea over the last several months , there was some concern that
she may be having chronic pulmonary embolus. For this reason she
was taken to VQ scan on 10/24/98 . This study was read as low
probability. She was transiently anticoagulated while awaiting the
results of the scan but the heparin was subsequently discontinued.
The reasons for her increase in oxygen requirement during the
course of this admission remained somewhat unclear. It is possible
that she has sleep apnea given her body habitus and this would
warrant follow-up as an outpatient. Her oxygen saturation at the
time of discharge is approximately 92% on room air.
Endocrine: At the time of admission the patient had blood sugars
in the range of 400 to 500. Her insulin doses were increased in
order to obtain better glycemic control. The reason for her sudden
increase in insulin needs remains elusive.
Orthopedics: At the time of the admission the patient had a set of
lumbosacral spine films done in order to rule out injuries related
to her fall. The films were read as showing a potential subtle
fracture of the coccyx. The patient had a significant amount of
pain in this area over the course of admission and it was thought
likely that she did , indeed , have a fracture. She has been working
with physical therapy in order to increase her mobility.
Gastrointestinal: The patient had been complaining over this
admission of some burning in her esophagus , as well as some
epigastric tenderness. It seems from review of her records that
this has been a chronic problem. She was started on Cisapride for
presumptive element of diabetic gastroparesis , in addition to being
maintained on her Prilosec. Of note , she had recently undergone
endoscopy and been diagnosed with a question of Helicobacter pylori
infection which has now been treated. However , her symptoms
continue. In addition , she had recently had a barium study in May
of 1996 that showed no abnormalities. It was decided that this
study did not warrant repeating at this point.
Neurologic: On several occasions during this admission the patient
became acutely confused. At these times she was not noted to have
a focal neurological examination. These instances appeared
questionably related to dosing of her Compazine and also all seemed
to occur in the evening. It was thought that she was probably
sundowning and , during her clearer moments , she reported having
similar problems at home.
Infectious disease: The patient began having some low grade fevers
on approximately hospital day #4. Blood and urine cultures at that
time were negative. Because of the low grade fevers and her
decreased oxygen saturation intermittently , chest x-ray and VQ scan
were done. The VQ scan was read as low probability. The chest
x-ray was read as having some atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
There was a question of whether this was atelectasis versus an
infiltrate. However , since the patient remained with a normal WBC
and no purulent sputum , it was thought unlikely that she had
pneumonia. She also reported having some congestion and it was
thought that she might be having low grade fevers from a upper
respiratory infection.
