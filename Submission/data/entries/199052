945493088 | AALH | 01169808 | | 0837685 | 7/20/2002 12:00:00 AM | LEFT ATRIAL MYXOMA | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 7/20/2002 Report Status: Signed
Discharge Date: 2/10/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Waycaster is a 70-year-old
gentleman who went to see primary care
physician and presented with aphasia. MRI was sent at that time ,
which revealed a left parietal infarct. A transesophageal
echocardiogram was done , which revealed a large left atrial myxoma
with prolapse across the mitral valve into the left ventricle with
a pedunculated stock. The patient does not have symptomatic heart
failure and is normal sinus rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for percutaneous
transluminal coronary angiography
and atherectomy with stent placement , history of recent
cerebrovascular accident , diabetes mellitus , oral agent treatment ,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , remote history of gout ,
chronic renal insufficiency , status post angioplasty and stenting
procedures , and anemia. He is status post a right nephrectomy in
1999 , with renal cell carcinoma and right knee replacement in 2001 ,
and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the year 2001. The patient
underwent cardiac catheterization on 2/15/02 , which revealed a
left anterior descending coronary artery with a 40% stenosis , first
obtuse marginal coronary artery with a 60% stenosis , a right
coronary artery with a 60% stenosis and a right dominant
circulation , ejection fraction of 50%. The patient underwent an
echocardiogram on 7/25/02 which revealed the following: ( 1 ) Left
ventricular cavity size with wall thickness and systolic function
appeared normal with an ejection fraction of 55% , with no akinetic
areas seen. ( 2 ) The right ventricle appears normal in size and
systolic function. ( 3 ) The aortic valve is trileaflet without
evidence of dysfunction. ( 4 ) The mitral leaflets appear mildly
thickened. There is light retrace mitral regurgitation. The left
atrium is enlarged. ( 5 ) A large heterogeneous multilobulated mass
is seen within the atrium. It appears to be attached by a stalk to
the interatrial septum. The mass measures approximately 7 x 3.5 cm
and prolapses to the mitral valve and to the left ventricle. The
distal portion of this mass has more mobile element. A mild amount
of inflow obstruction is noted , and there is also mild valvular
incompetence. The appearance of the mass is most consistent with
myxoma , although other primary and secondary neoplasms are also
possible. Thrombus is seen much likely , but superimposed thrombus
formation overlying the main mass is possible. ( 6 ) The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is trace tricuspid
regurgitation with peak velocity of 2.7 m/sec predicting pulmonary
artery systolic pressures of 29 mmHg plus right atrial pressure.
( 7 ) There is no evident pericardial effusion. ( 8 ) No prior studies
are available for comparison. ( 9 ) Findings reviewed with clinical
team. The patient also underwent a MRI of the brain which revealed
the following: ( 1 ) Left parietal infarct. ( 2 ) Bilateral posterior
communicating arteries. Otherwise , normal vasculature. The
patient was seen by the neurology service who recommended that the
patient did not proceed with his cardiac surgery at this time. He
will be discharged to home and be readmitted on 4/10/02 in the
year 2002 for his cardiac surgery. He has otherwise had an
uneventful hospital course and will be discharged to home in stable
condition.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Celexa 40 mg q.d. , atenolol 100 mg q.d. , allopurinol
100 mg q.d. , glyburide 5 mg q.a.m. and Lipitor 10 mg
in the evening.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm , with no
murmurs , rubs or heaves. RESPIRATORY:
Breath sounds clear bilaterally. NEURO: Alert and oriented with
an expressive aphasia.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA: Glucose 88 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.7 ,
sodium 140 , potassium 4.6 , chloride
102 , CO2 27. WBC 8.12 , hemoglobin 9.0 , hematocrit 28.6 , platelets
262. ESR 87.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg 1 p.o. q.d.
atenolol 100 mg q.d. , Lipitor 10 mg q.
evening , allopurinol 100 mg q.d. , glyburide 5 mg q. morning , Celexa
40 mg q.d.
Mr. Kowalcyk will be discharged to home in stable condition.
