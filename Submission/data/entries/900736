BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76 year old woman with CHF , moderate MR , PAF , HTN , and obesity who
presented with left upper arm pain since 3 pm the day of admission.
Denies any SOB , CP , N/V , diaphroresis. Took 5 baby aspirin at
home without relief of pain. Pain came on at rest. No history of
recent trauma. In ED , MSO4 relieved most of pain. Pain was noted to be
positional , increasing when arm is stretched down. Reports
increasing SOB over last several months , increased leg edema with 10
lb weight gain. No orthopnea or PND. PE: HR 58-61 , BP 141/81 98% RA.
PE: tenderness to palpation over L deltoid with pain with resistance to
abduction ( +supraspinatus involvement ). Full ROM in bilateral
shoulders. Chest: CTA bil. Neck: JVP 7 cm. ECG: 1st degree AVB , no
ischemic changes. CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary changes. Initial
enzymes flat. BNP 120
Hospital course.
The shoulder pain was felt to be secondary to supraspinatus
tendonitis/strain. The patient was advised to take a short course of
ibuprofen and was given shoulder exercises to do by physical therapy.
In addition , patient reports increased leg edema , SOB , and weight
gain. She ruled out for MI by enzymes and ECGs. By exam , much of the
changes in her legs appeared chronic. She did not appear to be in
respiratory CHF by exam or BNP. She does admit to dietary
indiscretions over the past few weeks. She was kept on her current
medications doses , including lasix 80 mg BID and instructed to keep a
daily weight log. A follow-up appointment was made for her with Dr.
Roginson on 4/20/03 . 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: 1. Daily weights each am. Please record to show Dr. Ciminera .
2. Low salt , fluid-restricted diet
