HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for cardiac work-up.
Since the patient had received a week of IV
antibiotics , the cellulitis seemed to have resolved. The Zoosyn
was stopped. The patient's cardiac medications were continued.
The patient had a cardiac catheterization on 28 of June which revealed
60% RCA , 50% lad , 60 to 70% D-1 and 100% distal left circumflex
lesion with an ejection fraction of 55%. Thus coronary artery
disease would not need revascularization prior to peripheral
vascular surgery.
As a result , the patient will be transferred to Reedpersi Memorial Hospital for vascular surgical procedure. The patient was strongly

throughout the hospitalization course.
