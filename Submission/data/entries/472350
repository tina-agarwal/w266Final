HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: The patient was admitted on
5/9/06. She had 10/10 bilateral leg pain which required change
of pain medication from oxycodone to Dilaudid , first p.r.n. doses
every 4 hours were allowed with 1-2 mg then this was augmented to
p.r.n. every 2 hours of 2-4 mg. Per pain consult , we changed
Neurontin to Lyrica 100 t.i.d. Over the next two days , patient's
pain symptoms improved tremendously on this regimen. She
decreased using the p.r.n. pain medications until she reached a
plateau of two usages of 2 mg Dilaudid p.o. a day next to her
methadone 5 mg three times a day.
UTI: During prehospital course , she ________ Bactrim and
ciprofloxacin , we put her on ceftriaxone 2 g once daily
intravenously for which her symptoms improved rapidly over the
next two or three days. She denies currently any abdominal pain ,
flank pain , dysuria , and urinary tract infection has clinically
resolved. Please continue intravenous medication for at least
another seven days until 5/12/06.
FUTURE CARE PLAN:
Neuropathic pain: The patient has diabetic neuropathy. The
patient is on Lyrica 100 mg three times a day , methadone 5 mg
three times a day , and Dilaudid p.r.n. p.o. Per pain consult , it
was suggested to change her antidepressant Prozac to Cymbalta 60
mg , this should be done with a taper of the Prozac and increasing
doses of Cymbalta. First start with 40 mg of Prozac and 10 mg of
Cymbalta then gradually increase the Cymbalta and decrease the
Prozac , to 30-20 , 20-30 , 10-40 , and then finally 60 mg Cymbalta.
Cymbalta has significant effects on diabetic neuropathic pain and
the patient would benefit largely from these measures. The
patient has pain consult setup with Dr. Branco at the Pain Clinic
here in the Kee Te Memorial Hospital on 4/23/06.
Obesity: The patient currently is morbid obese with a BMI of 50
which inhibits her abilities to care for herself , cleaning , and
going to the toilet , mobilization is difficult. The patient
would benefit from drastic dietetic weight loss programs/consider
GI surgical intervention to reduce appetite and help losing
weight.
