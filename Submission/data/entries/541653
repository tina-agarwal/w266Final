BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
CC: Chest pain
===================================================
HPI: 52 yo M with h/o DM , dyslipidemia , CAD s/p 2v CABG in '02 for RCA
dissection which was a complication of PCI ( LIMA to LAD , radial to PDA ) ,
and s/p multiple catheterizations for CAD and instent restenosis
presenting with atypical chest pain at rest. Since his last intervention
in 4/13 for re-stenting of his LCx , pt had been pain free , able to walk
about 1/2 mile without difficulty. On the morning of admission pt woke
up with sharp chest pain associated with diaphoresis and tingling down
his left arm. However , the pain was different from the pressure he had
felt from his previous admissions that were positive for stenosis. Pain
was described as sharp 9/10 that improved after taking his second dose of
ntg. The diaphoresis and arm symptoms resolved concurrently with the
chest pain. He received a third dose of ntg from the EMS and brought to
ED.
Of note , one week ago patient was struck in the center of his chest by
teenagers "horsing around" next to him. The impact was severe enough to
cause him to fall to the ground. He noticed pain around the region for
the next several days that he described as more pressure like different
from what he felt like this morning. Also noticed that since the
incident he has felt more tired than usual.
In ED patient was hemodyanmically stable HR 54-57 BP 113-142/64-78. Pt
was afebrile breathing at 18/min O2 sat 100% 2L. He was given another
dose of ntg by nasal spray , ASA 325 mg , Dilaudid 1mg for back pain ,
Plavix 75mg , and lovenox 100 mg.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
1 ) CHEST PAIN
On arrival to the floor patient was pain free but began to experience
nausea and vomiting which was relieved by ntg and then with a dose of
compazine. It was unclear if the nausea was related to ischemia or the
dose of dilaudid he received in the ED. However there were no ECG
changes during his nausea. Altogether the nausea lasted for
approximately 10 minutes. He remained pain free during the night with
what he described as some slight pressure over his chest. His chest is
tender at baseline ever since his CABG and it was difficult to assess
whether the pain was MSK or cardiac in nature. He sometimes felt it was
different from when he first presented with an MI , and at other times he
describes the pain as being related to movement and to the kick to the
chest that he received 2 weeks earlier ( see HPI ). Overnight on HD#1
patient did not require any more NTG doses , remained hemodynamically
stable , and three sets of enzymes were negative for MI. Pt had several
admissions in the past where he presented with chest pain and underwent
catheterizations , some of which revealed restenosis and some of which
were negative. Given his presentation was very atypical it was decided to
do a stress PET the next day to assess ischemia and then re-evaluate
plan. He was kept on his home regimen of cardiac medications in addition
to lovenox 100 mg SC for ACS. On HD#2 when moving from his chair to the
bed he began to complain of 2/10 chest pressure that he says felt a
little different than the pain when palpating his chest. Again there
were no ECG changes. He underwent a stress PET which was negative for
ischemia. Given his presentation with a clearly negative study it was
most likely that his symptoms were MSK in origin.
2 ) DM2
Patient's home regimen of oral hypoglycemic agents were held and he was
treated with basal insulin and a sliding scale.
3 ) FEN
NPO for stress PET , K/Mg scales
4 ) PPX
Patient was on lovenox for ACS , PPI
5 ) Full Code
