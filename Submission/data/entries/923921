Albuterol nebulizer q1 hour treatments. She was also given Bactrim
DS one p.o. b.i.d. for presumed bronchitis. The patient did well
over the hospital course with increasing peak flow to over 200 on
discharge. Her lung exam was also much improved with better air
movement on discharge. Immediately after admission , the patient
complained of one episode of burning , substernal chest relieved
with one sublingual Nitroglycerin. She did have EKG changes with
new upright T-waves throughout the precordium and in I , different
