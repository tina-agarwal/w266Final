Discharge Date: 7/16/2006
ATTENDING: CARAVALHO , PARIS M.D.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Pulmonary embolism.
2. Enterobacter pneumonia.
3. MRSA pneumonia.
4. Respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 68-year-old female with diastolic heart failure ,
hypertension , and diabetes , who is status post a perforated
duodenal ulcer repaired on 9/12/05 at an outside hospital. The
patient's course at the outside hospital was complicated by
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and
hypotension that required pressor support with Neo-Synephrine.
After aggressive diureses , she was extubated and on 11/28/05 , the
patient was transferred to Erverv Medical Center on
facemask. On 3/6/05 , the patient was found to have a left
upper lobe pulmonary embolism on chest CT and was started on
heparin drip. At that time , a chest tube was placed for removal of left
pleural effusion. Upon manipulation of the chest tubes , the
patient was noted to desaturate and required intubation.
Bronchoscopy was performed with copious secretions.
Echocardiogram on 3/6/05 showed moderate pericardial effusion
and evidence of right ventricular strain. At this time , the
patient was transferred to the CCU for further care.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Diastolic heart failure.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Osteoarthritis.
6. Peptic ulcer disease status post gram patch for perforated
duodenal ulcer on 9/12/05 .
7. Obesity.
8. Cervical stenosis.
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER TO THE CCU:
Fentanyl drip , versed drip , heparin drip , insulin drip ,
vancomycin , Flagyl , levofloxacin , Lopressor 5 mg IV q.6 h. ,

b.i.d.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
VITALS AT THE TIME OF TRANSFER TO THE CCU:
Temperature 102 , pulse 100-113 , blood pressure 86-125/39-50. The
patient was ventilated on assist control , tidal volume 400 ,
respiratory rate of 14 , overbreathing at 27 , PEEP of 10 with PIP
of 33 , saturating 92% on 95% FiO2. Physical examination revealed
a patient who was intubated and only mildly responsive to
stimuli. The patient's cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 ,
a possible S4 with no evidence of murmur. Her JVP was not
assessable at the time of transfer. Pulmonary exam revealed the
lungs that were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen
was soft. The patient grimaces with deep palpation to the right
lower quadrant. Her extremities were warm with no evidence of
rash and good pulses.
LABORATORY DATA:
Labs at the time of transfer to the CCU revealed a white cell
count of 13.3 , hematocrit of 30.8 , a platelet count of 200 , 000.
Sodium 141 , potassium 4.5 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 13 , creatinine of
0.5 , and glucose 131. PTT was 32.6 , INR 1.4. LFTs were normal
other than a mildly elevated total bilirubin at 1.1. CK was 27.
MB was 0.4. Troponin was 0.22.
STUDIES PERFORMED DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:
The patient had a chest CT on 3/6/05 that revealed left upper
lobe and lingular branch pulmonary embolism , but no evidence of
DVT. Her most recent chest CT done on 9/15/06 revealed
segmental atelectasis involving the posterior basal
and lateral basal segments of the left lower lobe , minimal
left-sided effusion , and slight improvement of opacities in
the upper lobe due to improving pneumonia. Abdominal CT
on 3/6/05 , revealed no evidence of free intraperitoneal gas or
extravasation of oral contrast to suggest persistent bowel
perforation. There was a small to moderate amount of ascites
with a more localized 2.5 cm phlegmonous area in the right
pericolic gutter , not amenable to percutaneous drainage. Follow
up abdominal CT on 10/28/06 , revealed decreased splenic
subcapsular hematoma and enlarged bilateral ovaries.
Transvaginal ultrasound on 10/22/06 revealed mildly enlarged and
lobular right ovary with the size of 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm.
IMPRESSION:
A 68-year-old woman with diabetes , hypertension , who presented to
an outside hospital with duodenal bleed on 11/15/06 , requiring
gram patch repair , complicated postoperatively by volume
overload , hypotension , pulmonary embolism , Enterobacter
pneumonia , and coag-negative Staph bacteremia.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
1. Infectious disease:
A. Enterobacter pneumonia: The patient completed a 14-day
course of imipenem for Enterobacter pneumonia. Chest CT on
5/6/05 showed resolving pneumonia. Sputum culture from
11/0/06 , revealed Enterobacter and MRSA. The sputum cultures
through 8/12/06 showed persistent Enterobacter. As the patient
was persistently febrile and repeat CT showed new left upper lobe
atelectasis with a question of infiltrate and bilateral ground
glass opacities , the patient was restarted on imipenem with the
addition of linezolid per recommendation of the Infectious
Disease consult team. The patient completed a full course of
imipenem on 10/30/06 , and a full course of linezolid on 7/13/06 .
Chest x-ray performed on 8/14/06 revealed no evidence of
consolidation.
B. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient had a urine culture on
8/12/06 that grew 100 , 000 colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The patient was initially placed on gentamicin; however , this was
switched to levofloxacin on 3/25/06 and then ciprofloxacin on
0/9/06 based on microbiologic susceptibilities. The patient
completed a full course of ciprofloxacin on 10/30/06 .
C. Enterococcus bacteremia: Blood culture on 7/24/06 grew
vancomycin susceptible Enterococcus. The patient completed a
14-day course of linezolid.
D. Candidal intertrigo: The patient was put on topical
antifungals with failure to improve candidal skin infection. She
was started on fluconazole 100 mg p.o. daily on 10/22/06 . She
will complete a seven-day course on 9/11/06 .
2. Pulmonary: The patient had a prolonged course of ventilator
dependence. A tracheostomy was performed on 9/5/05 . The
patient was successfully weaned to trach collar on 0/9/06 . Her
trach collar was capped on 8/14/06 and the patient has been
tolerating oxygen via nasal cannula since that point.
3. Heme:
A. Pulmonary embolism: The patient was found to have left upper
lobe and lingular branch pulmonary emboli. As discussed above ,
she was initially on heparin , which was discontinued on 11/0/06 .
The patient was found to be subtherapeutic on her Coumadin on
10/26/06 , and was initiated on Lovenox as a bridge at that time.
Lovenox was continued until 10/30/06 . At the time of discharge ,
the patient's Coumadin dose is 3 mg p.o. at bedtime. Her INR was
2.7 on 7/13/06 . Please continue to monitor and adjust dose
accordingly. There was some concern for possible right upper
extremity DVT during this hospitalization given the appearance of
right upper extremity swelling. Non-invasive studies were
negative for evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
B. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient was found to have an
iron less than assay on 8/25/06 , a TIBC of 181 , and ferritin of
828. She was started on ferrous sulfate. Her hematocrit has
been stable with the transfusion goal less than 27.
4. Cardiovascular:
A. Ischemia: No active issues.
B. Pump: The patient had an echocardiogram done on 10/5/05 ,
revealing normal LV function and size , and an ejection fraction
of 55-60% , no akinesis , mild right ventricular enlargement ,
moderate right ventricular global dysfunction , normal left
atrium , and right atrium , normal valves , and small circumscribed
pericardial effusion. The patient had evidence of fluid overload
on transfer to this hospital. She has been successfully diuresed
down to her dry weight of 100 kg. She was recently on
torsemide 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. that has been weaned off due to
concerns of increasing BUN and bicarbonate in the setting of
aggressive diureses. Please continue to monitor weights and dose
torsemide for concern of worsening fluid overload.
C. Rhythm: The patient has had a tachycardia , thought to be
secondary to fever and pulmonary embolism. Her heart rate the
day prior to discharge was 87-104.
5. Gynecologic: The patient has bilateral enlarged ovaries on
abdominal CT , confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound on 10/22/06 ,
revealing a mildly enlarged and lobular right ovary with the size
of 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm. The patient has a known history of enlarged
ovary , and comparison will need to be made with prior pelvic
ultrasounds as an outpatient. Recommended further outpatient
evaluations to rule out ovarian malignancy.
6. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient was
switched on 10/22/06 , on tube feeds of Jevity to increase the
fiber per recommendations of the nutrition consult team. We have
been continuing the free water boluses for mild hypernatremia.
The patient has a history of mild pill dysphagia and esophagogram
during this hospitalization revealed mild-to-moderate esophageal
dysmotility.
7. Endocrine: The patient has been followed by the Endocrine
consult team during the hospitalization for monitoring of blood
sugars. She has a tendency to become hypoglycemic when her tube
feeds are turned off. Please continue to monitor glucose
fingersticks every six hours.
8. Neurologic: We added Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. at bedtime and as
needed for anxiety or agitation. We also have added Klonopin 1
mg p.o. at bedtime.
9. Renal: As noted above , the patient has an elevated BUN to
creatinine ratio consistent with prerenal azotemia. We have held
all diuretic agents , this will need to be monitored in the rehab
setting.
10. GI: The patient is constipated. She is on a bowel regimen
of Colace and senna with p.r.n. lactulose. She was disimpacted
8/14/06 . She has a chronic pill dysphagia as discussed above.
11. The patient seen by the Dermatology consult service on
10/30/06 for concern of a blanching erythematous rash on her mid
back , buttocks , upper thighs , groin area , and around her pannus.
The Dermatology consult team felt that this was most consistent
with a drug hypersensitivity eruption. As the timing of the
rash was unclear , it makes it difficult to determine the
offending agents. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics ,
which are likely offenders and has been discontinued as the
courses were completed. The rash is fairly limited and appears
to be improving at the time of discharge. Please continue
clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day to the effected areas with
pramoxine 1% lotion three times a day , and Sarna lotion as needed
for pruritus. Okay to stop these medications when the rash has
resolved. The patient is in satisfactory condition at the time
of discharge. She is full code.
DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:
At the time of discharge , her laboratories were as follows:
Sodium 135 , potassium 3.8 , bicarbonate 39 , BUN 80 , creatinine
0.7 , and glucose 60. She had normal LFTs with the exception of a
mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 134. Calcium is 9.5 ,
magnesium 2.6. White cell count 17.5 , with a normal differential
hematocrit to 28.2 and stable , platelets 471 , 000. All blood
cultures have been negative for greater than a week. The patient
had a maximum temperature of 100 on the day prior to discharge
and continues to have low-grade fevers. As discussed above , her
INR is 2.7 at the time of discharge. Please continue to monitor
and adjust Coumadin accordingly.
