Discharge Date: 2/17/1990
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 58 year old woman ,
status post CABG times three in 9/9 ,
status post inferior myocardial infarction in 1/28 with a peak CPK
of 714. She has a history of chest pain since the CABG. The CABG
consisted of a LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein grafts to the OMB-2
and RCA. In 8/2 , she had been cathed and a 70% RCA occlusion with
a question of thrombus was seen. A 90% OMB-2 was seen; a
circumflex of 60% was seen; an LAD of 70% was seen. An LV-gram
showed inferior akinesis and posterior hypokinesis with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 78%. Post CABG at baseline , she
had substernal chest pain at rest with rare use of sublingual
nitroglycerin. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease which was
a duodenal ulcer with melena. She had an EGD in 8/27 which showed
mild antral gastritis without ulcers. She is status post
colonoscopy in 8/2 which showed diverticulitis. She has a history
of anemia with a hematocrit of 29 , MCV of 68. She was treated with
iron sulfate and H2 blockers. She noted a history in two months of
a 20 pound weight loss. One week prior to admission , she had
melena of loose stool. She felt light-headed. She had a cough and
nocturia. Three days prior to admission , she noted a stabbing
periodic epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting twice; no coffee
grounds or hematemesis. She had dysphagia for months to liquids
and solids with the sensation of aspiration on swallowing. She had
a sharp pain radiating to the left arm and shortness of breath.
The pain was similar to the inferior MI in 1988. On 0/16 , she came
to the emergency ward , where her blood pressure was found to be
110/68 lying and 90/palp sitting. O2 sat was 97% on room air. Her
JVP was 9 cm with crackles at the right base. She was given three
sublingual nitroglycerins and Maalox. Her hematocrit was 20.8.
She was given 10 mg of IV Lopressor from which she became
hypotensive , but this resolved. She was transfused three units of
packed red blood cells , given Lasix and IV H2 blockers. She went
to the unit and ruled out for an MI by EKG and enzymes. The A-set
revealed a CPK of 54; B-set was 48; C-set was 36. An ABG was 132 ,
99 , 7.43 , 33. Potassium was 4.2 , BUN 20 , creatinine 0.9.
ALLERGIES: None known.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: JVD was 9 cm on admission and decreased;
scar at the left base of the neck secondary
to a basal cell resection; II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
left sternal border without gallop. The lungs revealed crackles at
the right base one quarter. She had a kyphoscoliosis. The abdomen
was benign. The neuro exam was nonfocal , though she had some past
pointing secondary to poor eyesight.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On 10/17 , she was transferred to the floor. She
complained of some left arm pain secondary to her
IV , but she had no EKG changes and this improved with hot
compresses. She was guaiac negative. On the evening of 0/12 , she
was noted to be trace guaiac positive in the stool. On 9/9 at 7:30
AM , she complained of substernal chest pain which radiated to both
upper extremities with tingling bilaterally. This did not resolve ,
even after giving Maalox , four sublinguals and 12 mg of morphine
and three inches of Nitropaste. Her blood pressure was stable at
130/80 , heart rate was 68 , and she was afebrile. Her substernal
chest pain ranged between 7-3 , and she was given 20 mEq of Kay
Ciel. Her potassium was 3.8 , hematocrit 32.8 and stable. She was
given two more units of packed red blood cells after having been
given two more units of packed red blood cells between 10/17 and 2/10
IV nitroglycerin 50 units was started after one hour and 15 minutes
of pain. This was increased to 100 units. EKG changes were noted
as a flattening in V4 through V6 with no ST depressions , and she
had a T wave down in V3 which was new since admission. On 9/9 , she
was transferred to the unit. Her CKs were negative; A-set was 27 ,
B-set was 29 , C-set was 57 and D-set was 65. A catheterization
showed right atrial pressures of 12 , PCWP of 16 , SVR 1 , 000 , PVR 76 ,
PA 34/14 , cardiac output 6.8. Grafts from the aorta to the OM ,
aorta to the RCA and LIMA to the LAD were all patent. LAD showed
100% proximal occlusion , LAD diagonal showed a 50% long proximal
and circumflex showed a 50% proximal , OM-2 showed a 70% occlusion
at the origin. There was a mild increase in right and left sided
pressures. She was readmitted to the floor and watched. Her
hematocrit remained stable. She had an endoscopy done on the
morning of 3/28 , and the impression was of a large hiatal hernia
with no evidence of GI bleeding at this time. It was recommended
that she had an upper GI and small bowel follow through or repeat
colonoscopy in the future as an outpatient. Her hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 33 for the past four days. The
sed rate was 25 , PT and PTT within normal limits , potassium 4.2 ,
iron 182 , TIBC 432 , vitamin B-12 371 , folate 3.9 , ferritin 16 ,
cholesterol 153 , triglyceride 112
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home in stable condition.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 0.4 mg sublingual
p.r.n. FOLLOW UP will be with Dr. Pichard and with the GI service.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED.
2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , STATUS POST
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING.
