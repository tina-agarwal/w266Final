HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted on 9/23/05 following cardiac
catheterization showing three-vessel coronary artery disease with
occluded RCA , focal severe proximal LAD stenosis , significant
disease of OM1 and OM2. He was assessed preoperatively for
coronary artery bypass surgery. He was taken to the operating
room on 2/11/05 where he underwent CABG x4 with the sequential
graft with saphenous vein graft , one connecting the aorta to OM1
then OM2 , LIMA to LAD , saphenous graft 2 to PDA. The patient was
then bypassed for 108 minutes. He left the operating room with
one ventricular wire , two pericardial tubes ( Blake drains ) , and
one left pleural tube ( Blake drain ). For further details , please
see the dictated operative note. The patient was taken to the
cardiac surgery ICU on Claseat following surgery.
ICU COURSE BY SYSTEM:
Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented x3 throughout his ICU
stay. Following extubation , the patient had marginal respiratory
status , so pain control was accomplished with IV Dilaudid. The
patient had a history of chronic renal insufficiency , so Toradol
was avoided. When the patient was taking p.o.'s , Dilaudid was
changed to p.o. Dilaudid. Pain control was good with oral
Dilaudid throughout his ICU stay.
Cardiovascular: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on
postoperative day #1 through #3. However , the patient flipped
into atrial fibrillation in the 110s to 120s at 0100 on
postoperative day #3. He was started initially on his home dose
of 200 mg p.o. daily of amiodarone. However , later on
postoperative day #3 , this was changed to an amiodarone drip.
The patient was continued on amiodarone drip at 1 for six hours
and later decreased to 0.5 of amiodarone drip. Amiodarone drip
continued from postoperative day #4 to #5. The patient remained
in atrial fibrillation , so on postoperative day #3 at 1:00 a.m.
to postoperative day #6 , when he converted to sinus rhythm at
0500. The patient was transitioned to 200 mg p.o. daily of
amiodarone , which she was continued on at home after receiving
one full day of 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. amiodarone. He was
transferred out of the unit on 200 mg p.o. daily of amiodarone.
The patient was started on 50 mg p.o. q.i.d. of Lopressor. Since
postoperative day #6 , the patient has remained in rate controlled
sinus rhythm without any episodes of atrial fibrillation. The
patient is also on aspirin and Zocor.
Respiratory: The patient is status post right lower lobectomy in
1996 for lung cancer and has a 100-year smoking history. His
respiratory status was marginal following extubation at 0400 on
postoperative day #1. The patient remained on 100% high flow
oxygen from postoperative day #2 to #4. The patient required
q.2h. nasotracheal suctioning and q.1h. chest PT in order to keep
him from being re-intubated. From postoperative day #2 to #4 , on
chest x-ray , the patient's right middle lobe appeared to be
collapsed. There was a question of atelectasis versus pneumonia.
The patient was started on levofloxacin on 5/21/05 on
postoperative day #2 , for questionable right middle lobe
pneumonia , as lobe is collapsed and the patient had extremely
thick secretions. The patient was continued on aggressive chest
PT and pulmonary toilet. He had a strong cough and was able to
cough up thick secretions on his own. The patient was unable on
postoperative day #2 to #3 to remove mask without desats into the
70s to 80s. He was started on his nebulizers around the clock on
Atrovent and mucomyst nebs , as well as his home inhalers of
fluticasone and albuterol. The patient appeared to be tiring
early in the morning on postoperative day #3 and Anesthesia was
called for an evaluation but the patient continued to struggle
along on 100% oxygen for two more days between BiPAP and 100%
high flow oxygen. With BiPAP , patient's pO2 on his gas was
improved. ABGs continued improved as the patient was able to
mobilize more. The patient is diuresed with the Lasix drip with
improvement in his respiratory status as well. The goal is to
keep patient 1 liter negative in order to improve his pulmonary
status. The patient had an episode on postoperative day #3 of
20-second loss of consciousness while getting nasotracheal
suction around 2300 on 5/3/05 . This was initially thought to
be hypoxic in origin. However , the patient had two further
episodes with strong cough on postoperative day #5 and #6 of 20
to 30-second losses of consciousness with no signs of a vagal
origin on cardiac monitor.
By postoperative day #5 to #6 , the patient's respiratory status
had improved. Diuresis was continued. The patient was given a
dedicated triple-lumen catheter with a dedicated TPN line on
10/2/05 , postoperative day #4 , as it was unclear whether the
patient would turn the corner and avoid intubation , and the
patient was also without nutrition for several days at this
point. The patient continued to improve in terms of his
respiratory status with diuresis. By postoperative day #6 , the
patient's right middle lobe appeared to be re-expanding on chest
x-ray. It continued to be re-expanded from postoperative day #6
to #10 on transfer from the unit on 4/23/05 . The patient is
continued on t.i.d. Lasix after his drip was turned off on
5/6/05 . Goal was to keep the patient negative in order to
maximize his pulmonary status. The patient has marginal
pulmonary reserve. The patient also continues on levofloxacin
for a total of an 11-day course for prophylaxis against
pneumonia.
GI: The patient is on a minced diet on transfer from the unit.
The patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow. On
postoperative day #5 , 9/15/05 , a bedside evaluation was
performed and a video swallow was done. The patient at this time
was cleared for puree and thin liquids with a chin tuck. This
was changed to a minced diet on postoperative day #8 , as the
patient was thought to find this more palatable. The patient was
started on Nexium following extubation. TPN was started through
a dedicated port after a line change on postoperative day #4.
This was done , so the patient could continue getting nutrition
despite his marginal respiratory status. TPN was still continued
on discharge from the unit on 4/23/05 , as the patient had been
having calorie counts performed by nursing in order to make sure
that the patient was taking in adequate nutrition prior to
discontinuation of TPN. The patient continues to be in
aspiration risk , as he has very poor pulmonary status at
baseline. Continue calorie counts on discharge from the unit and
Nutrition will recommend stopping TPN when the patient is taking
enough in calories orally.
Renal: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3. His
creatinine has been stable around the 1.6 to 1.8 , postop
following diuresis with Lasix. The patient was started on a
Lasix drip on postoperative day #1 in order to gently diurese
him. He was continued on a Lasix drip until postoperative day #9
with adjustments to keep him negative and per chest x-ray every
morning. The patient was transitioned to 20 mg IV t.i.d. Lasix
on 5/6/05 , on postoperative day #9. This was increased on
postoperative day #10 , 4/23/05 , to 40 mg IV t.i.d. prior to
transfer from the unit , as the patient looked wet on chest x-ray.
The patient's right middle lobe appeared re-expanded on
postoperative day #6 to #10. This is critical for patient's
pulmonary reserve. Goal will be to keep the patient negative in
terms of his fluid balance in order to maximize his pulmonary
status. His creatinine has continued to remain stable. The
patient is urinating well and responds well to Lasix.
Endocrine: The patient was initially placed on a Portland
protocol and transitioned after postoperative day #3 to NovoLog
sliding scales with meals. At the time of transfer from the ICU ,
he continues on glipizide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. and then NovoLog
sliding scale with meals and nightly. He is also on NovoLog 8
units subcu with meals. This will be continued on transfer.
Sugar control has been good with these agents. The patient
remains on Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o. daily for his hypothyroidism.
Heme: The patient was started on aspirin on postoperative day #0
through his orogastric tube. This was continued on postoperative
with ECASA 325 mg p.o. daily , the patient's hematocrit and
platelets have been postop requiring no transfusions.
ID: The patient was started on levofloxacin on 5/21/05 ,
postoperative day #2 , for question of pneumonia with right middle
lobe collapse versus pneumonia on chest x-ray. This was
continued for a total of 11 days. The patient self medicates
with levofloxacin at home for bronchiectasis and chronic
bronchitis when his secretions become thick and troublesome.
