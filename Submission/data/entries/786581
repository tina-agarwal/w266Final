hypertension , atrial flutter who presented with six hours of chest
pain. The patient has had episodes of chest pain in the past.
Today the pain spread to her epigastrium and made her nauseated and

relief of her chest pain. Her EKG had no changes going from pain
to pain free. She was admitted for rule out of myocardial
infarction. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is significant for rheumatic
heart disease diagnosed at age 30. In 1965 she had a mitral valve
commissurotomy and in 1981 she had an mitral valve replacement with
St. Jude valve. In March of 1992 she was noted to have atrial
flutter and she was started on Clonidine , switched to Quinidine and
then put on Pravastatin. She has been cardioverted three times
most recently in March of 1994. History of congestive heart
failure , deep venous thrombosis x 2 , adult onset diabetes on NPH 10
units q AM , rheumatoid arthritis , question of cerebrovascular
accident and thyroid nodule , status post Iodine treatment. PAST
SURGICAL HISTORY: As above. ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN. She develops
anaphylaxis; ASPIRIN she gets a rash. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Were Lopressor , Coumadin , Lasix , Pravastatin , Plaquenil and
Insulin. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives alone. No alcohol , tobacco or
drug use. FAMILY HISTORY: She had a mother , brother and son all
who are notable for having irregular heart beats.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission she was afebrile. Blood
pressure was 200/palpable to 130/85. Her
saturation was 98%. Physical examination was unremarkable. Her
chest had bilateral crackles , left greater than right. On cardiac
examination her heart showed regular rate and rhythm , S-1 , S-2 with
slight S-1 snap. No rubs or gallops. Belly was soft. No
hepatosplenomegaly. Pulses were intact. She was neurologically
intact.
LABORATORY DATA: Significant for an elevated Chloride and an uric
acid of 7.8. Her first CK was 5.4.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction. She was started on Heparin ,
Lopressor and Nitropaste. Her Insulin was continued with q.i.d.
finger sticks and she was continued on her Pravastatin and her
Coumadin was held at this time. The patient remained stable with
subsequent CK's being 54 , 55 and 46. The patient's Lopressor was
increased to increase her rate control during her admission and
then her Coumadin was restarted. A Cardiology consultation was
obtained and the patient was begun on Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. with
adequate blood pressure tolerance. Her Lopressor was increased to
100 b.i.d. to improve symptomatic control. During her admission
the patient had experienced some chest pain on hospital day number
three. There were no EKG changes at that time and the pain
resolved spontaneously. The Cardiology Team at this point
recommended continuing medical management as the patient was in
reasonably good control of her pain and was not particularly
interested in more aggressive intervention at this time. She did
have a MIBI that was performed , however , that was equivical
secondary to cardiac rotation in a setting of atypical chest pain.
The Cardiology Team felt that it was not necessary to cath this
patient , however , they did recommend noninvasive studies of her
legs , PVR's and AVI's as an outpatient to evaluate possible
claudication.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged on January , 1994.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. and
Isordil 10 mg t.i.d.; Insulin 10 units NPH , q AM. FOLLOW-UP CARE:
