PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was afebrile at
97.8 with heart rate of 80 , blood pressure
110/50 , lying down and sitting up heart rate of 88 and blood
pressure of 120/50. He was satting 97% on room air. GENERAL: He
was awake , alert , Spanish speaking male , poor historian. HEENT:
NC/AT , EOMI , PERRLA. OROPHARYNX: Negative with moist mucous
membranes. NECK: He had no JVP. CORONARY: Regular rate , no

ABDOMEN: Soft , non-tender , tympanic with good bowel sounds and no
peritoneal signs. RECTAL: Showed guaiac positive brown stool.
EXTREMITIES: Warm , dry but poorly palpable peripheral pulses.
Cranial nerves examination showed II/XII grossly intact and motor
and sensory exams were without gross deficit.
LABORATORY: His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with first degree
AV block , rate of 78 , PR of 212 , QRS of 96 and QT 448
with axis of 57. He had some flat Ts in AVL and T wave inversion
in V1. His chest x-ray had no infiltrate , no effusion and no
evidence of failure. Laboratory revealed sodium of 138 , potassium
of 4.1 , chloride 103 and bicarbonate of 25 with BUN of 17 and
creatinine 1.2. His baseline was 0.7 in 0/24 .  Glucose was 186 and
anion gap of 10. He had a white count of 8.2 , hematocrit of 17.9
which his baseline was 39.5 in 0/24 , platelets of 280 and MCV of
68. He had 66 neutrophils , 21 lymphs and 8 monos and PT of 12.1 ,
PTT of 21.3 and INR of 1.0. His CK was 47 and Troponin was 21.9.
His amylase was 28 and lipase was 187.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problem list: Heme: He had a hematocrit of
17.9 down from baseline of 39.5. He was
transfused three packed red blood cells and his hematocrit
responded appropriately. It was 34.5 by the day of discharge. He
also had iron studies sent off that showed a total iron binding
capacity of 324 and ferritin of 20 consistent with iron deficiency
anemia. He was restarted on Niferex.
GI: Given this guaiac positive stool and history of guaiac
positive stool in 1999 , he was thought to have an acute on chronic
GI bleed questionably secondary to diverticulosis or cancer. He
also has history of gastritis. We kept him NPO. GI consult was
obtained. He underwent initially an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
which was completely normal. Esophagus had no varices , no
esophagitis. Stomach was normal; no ulcer , no erosion or end NSAID
gastropathy. His duodenum to D3 was normal with small
periampullary diverticulum. Colonoscopy was then performed which
found sigmoid diverticulosis , 4 millimeter non-bleeding sessile
polyp which was removed by snare cautery and some mild oozing after
the polypectomy but good hemostasis was achieved. Small , internal
hemorrhoids were present but no active bleeding sites were found.
On pathology , it was found to be a hyperplastic polyp. GI team
recommended small bowel follow through to rule out small bowel
source for bleeding as an outpatient. The patient was kept on his
Zantac 150 b.i.d. for history of gastritis. The patient was sent
home on Tylenol for pain and told to avoid taking aspirin or any
other NSAIDs given his GI bleed.
Renal: Creatinine was 1.2 on admission. His baseline was 0.9. He
received some IV fluids as he was NPO for his GI studies and his
creatinine came down to 0.9. So , it was likely that he was
slightly volume depleted on admission.
Cardiovascular: The patient had a history of angina but no recent
chest pain and no cardiac complaints. With his hematocrit of 18 ,
he had a flat CK and Troponin of 0.19 and had no further cardiac
issues during this hospital course. He was kept off aspirin given
his GI bleeding. THe patient also has hypertension and was on
Isordil and Cardizem for that. His blood pressure meds were held
initially on admission and were re-added back at the time of
discharge as well as his Mevacor.
Endocrine: The patient was maintained on his Humulin NPH and
covered with sliding scale during this admission. His blood sugars
remained in the 160 to 180 range.
Pulmonary: The patient was kept on his Albuterol and Azmacort
metered dose inhalers and by the time of discharge , was without
wheezes and satting well at 96% on room air.
Neuro: The patient was kept on his Klonopin and Paxil for anxiety.
Fluid , electrolytes and nutrition: The patient was started on
magnesium oxide for low magnesium during his hospital course.

p.r.n. headache , 2. Isordil 20 mg p.o.
