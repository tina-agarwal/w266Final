BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Josef Chandley is a
71-year-old white female who underwent cardiac transplantation on
6/12/1992. She has had a variety of important posttransplant
medical issues including diabetes , obesity , and spinal stenosis.
She has also had significant vascular disease including allograft
coronary artery disease and bilateral carotid artery disease. She
underwent stenting of the right internal carotid artery in
9/2 and stenting of the left internal carotid artery in 10/29
In addition , in 9/2 , she underwent stenting of the left
circumflex coronary artery and in 5/6 , she underwent stenting of
the left anterior descending coronary artery. At the time of her
catheterization in August , it was noted that she had additional
disease in the left circumflex and the posterior descending coronary
artery and the decision was made to perform an additional procedure
for some or all of these lesions. The patient now returns for repeat
intervention in the left circumflex PCI Notes---
Complicated bifurcation lesion of mLCX involving OM1 and OM2.
Bifurcation ultimately treated with "coulotte" stenting with 2.5( 28 )
Cypher in lower branch and 2.5( 18 ) Cypher in upper branch. Kissing
balloon inflations performed at the end of the procedure. There was
a dissection in the mid portion of the lower OM at the end of the
case. Likely due to coronary guidewire that had to be
placed in a tortous vessel. Given distal nature of dissection , we
elected not to treat further at this time. Patient tolerated
procedure well without complaints.
Started integrilin at the end of the case for 18 hours.
She should remain on aspirin for life and clopidogrel indefinitely.
She will have her CK's checked as well as Cr. in AM.
SSI coverage. Mucomyst and
IVF Manual 8Fr sheath removed from Rt
CFA.
