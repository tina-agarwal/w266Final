Discharge Date: 0/20/1993
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN.
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES: 1. HYPERTENSION.
2. HISTORY OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
3. SCIATICA.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46 year old woman
with a history of coronary artery
disease , hypertension and chronic pain , admitted with chest pain.
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension , increased cholesterol ,
positive family history and history of coronary artery disease. She
has a history of Q wave myocardial infarction with right
ventricular infarct in March 1992. Peak CK's were 2300.
Catheterization showed 100% RCA lesion which was treated with
angioplasty reduced to 20-30% stenosis. The patient had chest pain
the succeeding months and had two catheterizations showing no
change in her coronary arteries. Echocardiogram showed an LVEF of
50%. Subsequent catheterization March 92 , August 92 and July 92
for atypical chest pain , showed clean coronaries. Exercise tread
mill test in July 92 , the patient went three minutes and 31 seconds
with standard Bruce protocol and stopped secondary to atypical
chest pain. Maximum heart rate 162 , blood pressure 176/90 , no ST
or T wave changes. In May 92 she ruled out for myocardial
infarction by enzymes and EKG , after presenting with prolonged
chest pain. VQ scan was low probability. Chest CT ruled out aortic
dissection. The patient was referred to the Pain Service. In
February 1993 the patient had additional sharp chest pain , again
ruled out for myocardial infarction , was seen by the Pain Services
and discharged on trazodone and Relafen plus cardiac medicines.
The patient now presents to the hospital with 24 hours of right
sided chest pain , stating that it was squeezing in her right
breast , felt to be between the shoulder blades. She took two
sublingual Nitroglycerin the day before admission and three on the
morning of admission without relief. She complained of shortness of
breath , dizziness , weakness and nausea , no palpitations were noted.
The pain was not worse with positional changes. The patient is seen
in the Sonri Health emergency room where she received
two sublingual Nitroglycerins which reduced her pain from 7/10 to
1/10 level. She also received 10 mg IV Morphine , 725 mg IV
Lopressor , two inches Nitro Paste and two liters of oxygen. The
pain was intermittent through the rest of the day. She had no
fever , chills , cough , she did complain of urinary frequency ,
chronic left back pain and right lower extremity pain. ALLERGIES:
Penicillin , erythromycin and tetracycline which causes hives.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pulse 92 , blood pressure 148/100 ,
temperature 98.1 , she is an obese female in
no acute distress. Cardiac , regular rate and rhythm , SI , SII , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. The pain is not reproducible by
palpation. Extremities , 1+ edema of the lower extremities with
preserved peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Cholesterol 226. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm
of 90 beats per minute , normal intervals , left
ventricular hypertrophy. There were T wave inversions in Leads I ,
V2 , V6 , bisphasic T waves V5 , flat waves V3 , V4 , left atrial
enlargement. Compared with the examination of 5/12/93 T wave
inversions were less deep in V3 through V5.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by
serial EKG and enzymes. Her blood pressure was
initially poorly controlled and she was placed on a regimen of
Aldomet 750 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Lopressor 150 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
Nifedipine XL 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. On 10/17/93 the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization which showed normal coronary arteries ,
mildly elevated pulmonary pressure of 40/24 and mean of 30 ,
capillary wedge pressure of 14 mm mercury. On the afternoon of
6/17 the patient had 600 mg of Levatol and two hours later
complained of light-headedness with a systolic blood pressure in
the 80's. This gradually increased to greater than 110 systolic so
the patient was placed in Trendelenburg position and received 400
cc's of IV fluids. She was also noted to have the onset of
wheezing. 02 sat was 95% on five liters of oxygen , chest x-ray
showed cardiac enlargement with regeneration of the pulmonary flow
suggestive of mild congestive heart failure. The patient received
albuterol nebs q 15 minutes x 4 with good response and was felt to
have had a bronchospastic reaction to beta blockers. She did well
for the rest of her hospitalization , had no further chest pain.
DISPOSITION: She was discharged in good condition to home with
instructions to followup with Dr. Kasten on Tuesday
March .  MEDICATIONS: Enteric coated aspirin 1 p.o. q d;
Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.; trazodone 100 mg p.o. q h.s.; Elavil 25
