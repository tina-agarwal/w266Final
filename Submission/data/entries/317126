Discharge Date: 2/9/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old Oriental male
with three vessel coronary artery
disease awaiting surgical evaluation. The initial onset of angina
was in 1972. He had a positive ETT with ST depressions in V5 and
V6. He had only rare angina since then treated with sublingual
nitroglycerin or rest. On 0/4/91 , he had a positive ETT which was
stopped secondary to chest pain. The EKG showed 2 mm ST
depressions in two , three , F and V4 through V6. He was encouraged
to have a cardiac catheterization , but he was reluctant to do this.
He has good exercise tolerance; takes long walks with his wife
without chest pain and swims for an hour a day. He had a cardiac
catheterization on the day of admission which showed 70% left main ,
100% left circumflex , 100% RCA and 90% LAD. PAST HISTORY:
Significant for GI bleed in the past. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Atenolol; Persantine.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant man in no acute
distress. The HEENT exam was benign. The
neck was supple and nontender. The lungs were clear. The heart
exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm. Pulses were 2+
bilaterally without bruits. The neuro exam was nonfocal.
ASSESSMENT: 58-year-old Oriental male with unimpressive symptoms
but strongly positive ETT and severe three vessel coronary artery
disease including left main at catheterization.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen by cardiac surgery and
evaluated. He was taken to the operating room on
6/25/91. He had a coronary artery bypass graft times four with a
LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein grafts to the diagonal , marginal
and PDA. Postoperatively he did very well with the exception of
24-48 hours of severe confusion and agitation after extubation
requiring four point restraints and Haldol. He gradually resolved
this by postop day #3 and began gently diuresing. His wound had
continuous oozing from the left thigh with no erythema or sign of
infection. This was continued on dressing changes.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged uneventfully on postop day #7 with
VNA follow up for his wound. FOLLOW UP will be with
Dr. Attaway in three weeks.
