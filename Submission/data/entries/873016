CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Andreessen is a 31 year-old black female
with diabetes mellitus ( insulin
requiring ) who is admitted with emesis and diabetic ketoacidosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in
1984 after the patient presented with a
history of polyuria , polydipsia , fatigue. She was treated with
oral hypoglycemics initially. In 1985 she was hospitalized for a
questionable episode of diabetic ketoacidosis with recurrent
polydipsia , polyuria , nausea and vomiting and she was changed to
insulin treatment.
Subsequently , the patient had intermittent compliance , with
occasional dietary indiscretions with greater than 2500 calories
intake and decreased exercise. Her dose of insulin in 1991 was
Humulin N 40 units subcutaneous qam and 20 units qpm with regular
insulin 5 units qam and 5 units qpm added. In May of 1993 her
glycosylated hemoglobin ( hemoglobin A1C ) was 20.2 and her finger
stick blood glucose was 265. On November , 1993 her finger stick
blood glucose ranged from 96 to 189. In March 1994 her insulin
dosing was 40 units subcutaneous qam and regular 5 units qam , 5
units of regular q noon and 5 units qpm.
In early March of 1994 her finger stick blood glucoses ranged
between 160 and 240. She indicated she was depressed about her
diabetes. On March she awoke at 5 am and had 10 episodes of
emesis progressing from clear to greenish to black. She noted that
she had felt well the day previous with no dietary indiscretions
and had taken her insulin as usual on the days prior to this
episode. She denied any abdominal pain , there was no history of
fever or chills and no diarrhea. There was also no immediate
complaint of hematemesis. The patient went to Ertmu Oaktan Wallro Medical Center Urgent Care unable to hold down her food intake and
blood sugar was noted to be 333. She received 5 units of
subcutaneous insulin and her blood sugar went to 247. She also
received intravenous fluids , 25 mg of Compazine and 0.5 mg of
intravenous Ativan. The patient had serum ketones present and her
serum bicarb was 16 , initially noted at Uflehill Brent Hospital Medical Center She was transferred to Unral Imbrohealt Health
Emergency Department for further management. The patient's recent
creatinine clearance in the urine was 70 , her urine total protein
was 177 mg for 24 hours. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable
for adult onset diabetes mellitus requiring insulin , endometriosis ,
status post exploratory laparotomy in 1990. She was never
pregnant , para 0 , gravida 0. She had a history of dysmenorrhea.
She had a history of yeast vaginitis , history of
hypercholesterolemia and a history of atrial septal defect ,
repaired in 1975. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: At the time of
admission , the patient was on insulin Lente 40 units subcutaneous
qam , regular 5 units subcutaneous qam and 5 units subcutaneous q
noon , 5 units subcutaneous qpm; demulon and lupron for 9 months
which was discontinued several days prior to admission. ALLERGIES:
To Penicillin and sulfa drugs , the results of which were not clear.
Also , aspirin caused epistaxis in the past. FAMILY AND SOCIAL
HISTORY: She lives by herself. She works as a lawyer and professor
of law. She noted that her family history is positive for adult
onset diabetes mellitus in her mother and her grandmother as well
as a family history of hypertension. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Revealed
metromenorrhagia and increased menstrual flow recently. She also
noted she had decreased her exercise recently.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination her vital signs were
as follows: Temperature 99.7 , heart rate of
127 , blood pressure and respiratory rate normal. She was a
pleasant , young , black female frequently vomiting. HEENT: Notable
for normal examination. Neck supple. There was brisk carotid
upstrokes , no thyromegaly was noted. Lungs were clear to
auscultation and percussion. Heart was tachycardic. S1 and S2
with a holosystolic murmur heard at the apex radiating to the left
sternal border. There was an early decrescendo diastolic murmur at
the base in the aortic area , the lateral resolved with fluids.
Abdomen was tender in the epigastrium , it was very tender in the
suprapubic area. Extremities were without edema , cord cyanosis or
erythema. Neurological examination was within normal limits on
modalities.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 105 ,
bicarbonate 14 , BUN of 12 , creatinine 0.6 ,
glucose 290. White blood cell count 10.6 , platelets 255 ,
hematocrit 36.1 with a mean corpuscular volume 85.5. Coags were
normal. Arterial blood gas pH 7.24 , pO2 102 , pCO2 of 27 ,
bicarbonate 12. She was acid test positive. Her chest x-ray
showed questionably large pulmonary arteries bilaterally. There
was no infiltrate or effusion noted. KUB noted a large bladder.
There was no bowel gas , we could not rule out ascites. EKG was
notable for sinus tachycardia at 122 , intervals were 0.15 , 0.088
and 0.47.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. Buffey was admitted with a diagnosis of
diabetic ketoacidosis. She was started on
intravenous fluids of D5 normal saline with 40 mEq of potassium per
liter. She also received and insulin drip intravenously. She had
her finger stick blood glucoses checked every 2 hours. She also
had her blood electrolytes and acid tests checked frequently.
Given the fact that she was febrile and had presented with
acidosis , had a harsh cardiac murmur , she had blood cultures times
3 drawn. There were no obvious sources of infection.
Regarding her GI bleed , she began to cough up coffee ground emesis
after repeated episodes of wretching throughout the day. The
bleeding was thought to be due to a Mallory-Weiss tear due to the
excessive vomiting. The patient had an NG tube placed for lavage
which quickly lavaged clear after approximately 1 liter of diluant.
A nasal gastric tube was put to Gomco low suction. Additionally ,
the patient had intravenous fluids running and her orthostatics and
hematocrit were checked frequently. She was started on H2 blockers
intravenously and a GI consultation was obtained.
Regarding the diabetic ketoacidosis , the patient obtained
consultation from the Endocrine Division. With intravenous fluids
and insulin drip her ketoacidosis resolved. The endocrinologist
suggested the ultimate regimen of insulin which will be described
below. Notably , the patient indicated that she could not reliably
time the midday lunch schedule. Therefore , the patient was given
some flexibility in terms of dosing of insulin at that hour.
Regarding her cardiac workup , the patient was noted to have a loud
systolic murmur. She was evaluated by the Dell Hospital
who recommended echocardiography. The results of the
echocardiogram were as described below. The echocardiogram was
obtained on 18 of February , the results were as follows: The left atrium
was mildly dilated. The tricuspid valve leaflet excursion was
mildly increased with tricuspid regurgitation measured as 2+ out of
4+ with a peak velocity of 2.5. It was thought that she had a
mildly dilated right atrium and a mildly concentric hypertrophied
left ventricle. Mitral regurgitation was 3+ out of 4+. Left
ventricular wall thickness was upper limits of normal with
preserved left ventricular systolic function ejection fraction of
65 percent. The patient abnormalities of her atrial ventricular
canal noted consistent with ostium primum. Her left and right
atrial ventricular grooves inserted at the same level of the
intraventricular septum. There was some evidence of flow reversal
in the pulmonary veins as well as the mitral regurgitation noted
above. There was a high flow velocity jet seen in the paramembrane
of intraventricular septum , moving from left to right , consistent
with residual ventricular septal defect. There was no atrial
septal defect seen status post surgical repair. There was a small
echocardiogram bright density at the left ventricular site of the
paramembranous septum thought to be an anomalous cord attachment
from the mitral valve versus endocarditis.
On March , the patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram
to evaluate this abnormality seen above. There was no evidence of
residual atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect. There
was an anomalous chordal attachment to the base of the interior
leaflet of the mitral valve and no endocarditis vegetations were
seen.
The patient was noted to have hypertension and was started on
Lisinopril , nifedipine was transiently given but was discontinued.
The patient was discharged in satisfactory condition on March ,
1994. There were no complications of the hospitalization.
Operations and procedures of the hospitalization were an esophageal
gastroduodenoscopy by Dr. Cornea on August , 1994.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: At the time of discharge , the patient
was on Lisinopril 20 mg po q day; insulin
12 units plus a regular scale qam before breakfast , insulin 8 units
plus the scale of regular insulin q noon before lunch , insulin 8
units of regular plus a scale of regular qpm before supper , insulin
NPH 15 units subcutaneous qhs. The scale of regular insulin was as
follows: Less than 80 , drink orange juice; greater than 80 , 1 unit;
greater than the 120 , 2 units; greater than the 160 , 3 units;
greater than 200 , 4 units; greater than 500 , 5 units; greater than
300 , notify medical doctor.
FOLLOW UP CARE: The patient was to follow-up with the following
physicians: Dr. Harlan Flair at the Varutldale Memorial Hospital , also Dr. William Fanizza in the Woou Land Health and Dr. Dobles in the Endocrinology
Clinic. The patient was to schedule these appointments herself.
