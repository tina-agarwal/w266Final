Discharge Date: 6/28/2007
ATTENDING: MIDGET , IRA M.D.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Hip fracture.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post hip surgery and end-stage renal
disease.
Please see original dictation for the history of present illness ,
past medical history , medications on admission , allergies , social
history , the family history , physical exam on admission , EKG on
admission and all data. Please also see that for the initial
hospital course this dictation only goes from November
through 0/6/07.
1. Orthopedics. There is no update on his orthopedics course.
He needs to continue his heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice
daily for one month following his surgery , which was 3/14/07 , so
he just about to complete this one month course. He should be on
Ultram 50 mg every twelve hours as needed for pain. All
narcotics should be avoided as these results in severe delirium
for Mr. Puotinen
No update to cardiovascular ischemia.
Cardiovascular rhythm. His Lopressor continued to be held for
the remainder of his hospitalization. His blood pressure was
within normal limits between 100-110/60-70 and his heart rate
remained in the 60s-70s , no higher than the 80s. If his blood
pressure increases , starting Lopressor again at 25 mg twice daily
would be wise , however , currently his blood pressure is not high
nor does his rate require this.
There is no uptake to his renal course. He continued on his
dialysis on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturdays. However , he also
got dialysis on Friday the 3 of May since he is being discharged
today , so that he can be changed to a Monday , Wednesday , and
Friday dialysis course at the Ans General Medical Center
From an endocrine perspective , he remained on sliding scale
insulin only. He did not need to be restarted on his Lantus.
There is no further update to his GI oncologic history. He
should continue to follow up with Dr. Trimboli on in 11/8/07 at
3:00 p.m.
From a delirium perspective , his Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime was
discontinued after his sense of delirium has been cleared for
multiple days. However , if he were to start to have any sorts of
hallucinations or issues with confusion , we would restart the
Zyprexa immediately 2.5 mg at bedtime +2.5 mg as needed. The
patient is currently stable again off Zyprexa , but it has only
been discontinued for two days , so he may well need this to be
added on. As soon as the Zyprexa is added on , he has cleared his
delirium pretty quickly , so this has been quite effective for
him.
From an ID perspective. He was continued on his rifampin 300 mg
twice daily as well as his penicillin 2 million units every four
hours and these antibiotics should be continued through 0/7/07.
He has an appointment with Dr. Kerschner in the ID Clinic on
6/25/07 at 8:00 a.m. to follow up on these issues. Please make
sure that the patient attends this appointment as it is very
important in terms of deceptive time running any changes in his
antibiotic course. He completed his course of Valtrex and does
not need any further treatment with Valtrex.
Gout. The patient developed gout in his right MCP and PIP joints
several days prior to discharge. He was restarted on his
colchicine every other day. He was also started on a higher dose
of prednisone of 20 mg daily. This should be continued for five
additional days and then he can be decreased back down to 10 mg
for several days and then down to his baseline dose of 5 mg
daily. He should continue on 5 mg of prednisone daily for the
foreseeable future.
From an FEN perspective , Nutrition was following the patient and
they recommended that he has his phosphorous checked regularly
and that he have assistance with his meals as much as possible so
that he can eat as much as possible.
From a hyponatremia perspective , his sodium was improved at the
time of this dictation and in fact on discharge , his sodium was
132. He should continue on free water restriction at the
King Ch Memorial Hospital as his hyponatremia is likely from
hypervolemic hyponatremia given his low albumin and poor oncotic
pressure.
Code status , the patient will continue to be full code at the
time of this discharge addendum.
TO DO: Please make sure the patient continues with his
antibiotics through 4/21/07 also make sure that he sees Trey Kachmarsky in the ID Clinic on 6/25/07 at 8 a.m. Please also make
sure that he sees Dr. Ronald Treiber at the Fullming Skaggs Ingoernstrong Rid Health on 11/8/07 at 3 p.m. as well as Dr. Milton Fiero on
5/12/07 11:30 a.m. He should also follow up with his primary
care physician , Dr. Criqui following discharge from Faxventci Medical Center

1. Digoxin 0.125 mg every other day.
2. Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily.
