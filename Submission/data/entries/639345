history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation who has been intolerant of Quinidine and Procainamide

atrial rate of 300 and ventricular rate of approximately 85. She
had been treated on Diltiazem which was changed to Verapamil with
discontinuation of her palpitations. On 10/9/92 , she had an echo
which showed an ejection fraction of 67% , left atrium of 4 cm , and
normal left ventricular size and thickness. The sensation of
palpitations resumed , however , and she was admitted to Lee's County Hospital on May , 1993 to begin Quinidine treatment.
