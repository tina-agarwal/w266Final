Discharge Date: 5/0/2006
ATTENDING: NIEDZWIEDZKI , FELIX MD
DIAGNOSIS:
Respiratory failure , fluid overload.
SERVICE:
Medical Intensive Care Unit.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Bryne is a 67-year-old man with history of multifactorial
hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure with a recent prolonged
stay at the Fordtist Hospital Medical Intensive Care
Unit ( 7/15/06 - 4/17/06 ) who was discharged to Stown Valley Medical Center with tracheostomy and PEG on 4/17/06 . The
patient had done well at rehab with significant improvement in
his pulmonary status to the point that he was off the ventilator
using a nasal cannula for supplementary oxygen only. He also had
significant improvement in his functional status with ability to
stand and ambulate for short distances as well as improvement in
his mental status back to baseline. However , over the several
days prior to this admission his respiratory status had been
deteriorating with an increasing respiratory rate , increased work
of breathing , and falling oxygen saturations. For the last two
nights prior to admission , the patient had to be bagged overnight
and was not able to maintain saturations above the high 80s. He
had been afebrile with no change in cough or secretions. He
denied any abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea. He was started
on empiric levofloxacin on the day prior to admission as well as
some increased diuresis with an increase in his standing Lasix
dose to 40 mg IV q. 8h. According to the patient's wife , this
did improve his respiratory status somewhat; however , he was
still unable to remain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient
also received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit
of 25 the day prior to admission. The morning of admission to
Ronon Health it was felt that the patient's
respiratory distress and poor oxygenation were such that he
needed to return to ventilator assistance. The patient was then
transferred to the Prinin Health Emergency
Department where on arrival his vitals were notable for a heart
rate of 76 , blood pressure 123/62 , respirations 28 , oxygen
saturation of 92% by nasal cannula. He was placed on the
ventilator at pressure support with 10 of pressure support and 5
of peak with an FIO2 of 50%. Arterial blood gas at this time was
7.38 , 66 , and 63.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes mellitus ( hemoglobin A1c of approximately 10 ).
2. Morbid obesity , likely obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.
3. Status post tracheostomy and PEG placement after PMH MICU
stay for hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure , 7/15/06 to
4/17/06 .
4. Status post crush injury to bilateral lower extremities ,
followed by right below the knee amputation and surgical
reconstruction of the left lower extremity.
5. L3 radiculopathy.
6. Hypertension.
7. Left internal capsule CVA in 1997 with residual chronic fine
motor deficits of the left hand , chronic mild word-finding
difficulty , short-term memory loss , mild left lower extremity
weakness and left foot drop.
8. Right lower extremity prosthesis.
9. History of left DVT on Coumadin.
10. Chronic shortness of breath.
11. Likely sleep apnea.
12. Urinary frequency.
13. Iritis: Right eye recurrent episodes , negative
rheumatologic workup.
14. Central blindness , left eye , since childhood.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO O HOSPITAL :
Levofloxacin 750 mg p.o. daily started 5/1/06 , Coumadin 3 mg at
bedtime , Lasix 40 mg IV t.i.d. started 5/1/06 , labetalol 200 mg
t.i.d. , simvastatin 80 mg at bedtime , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily ,
amlodipine 10 mg p.o. daily , Lantus 56 units at bedtime ,
tiotropium 18 mcg daily , Flovent one puff b.i.d. , sodium chloride
nasal spray q.i.d. , albuterol nebulizers p.r.n. , Mucomyst
nebulizers p.r.n. , senna , bisacodyl suppository 10 PR daily ,
nystatin swish and spit q.i.d. , Ramelton 8 mg at bedtime , Haldol
5 mg per G-tube at bedtime p.r.n. and Haldol 1 mg q. 6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has lived with his wife though he has been at rehab
since 4/17/06 . He is a former longshoreman. He is
self-educated and an avid reader. His wife is a neonatal
intensive care unit attending physician at Gno Jones Medical Center . 
The patient quit use of tobacco in 1995 and does not drink
alcohol. He denies use of any illicit drugs.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On arrival to WBKH MICU , was notable for temperature of 97.3 ,
heart rate 68 and normal sinus rhythm , blood pressure 140/56 ,
respiratory rate in the 30s , oxygen saturation 92% on pressure
support 10 and 5 with an FiO2 of 50%. The patient was an obese
alert man in no acute distress. Physical exam notable for coarse
breath sounds anteriorly and diminished breath sounds at
bilateral bases , distant heart sounds. Right lower extremity has
a BKA. Left lower extremity with 2+ edema with some chronic
color change suggestive of venous insufficiency. Distal pulse
not palpable.
Chest x-ray revealed tracheostomy tube in position , a right
pleural effusion , somewhat difficult to evaluate lung bases.
Echocardiogram 7/15/06 revealed normal size and function of the
left ventricle , normal right ventricle , and a trivial pericardial
effusion.
LABORATORY DATA:
At the time of admission , were notable for a creatinine of 1.3
improved from 1.5 at the time of discharge on 4/17/06 .
Urinalysis revealed 50-100 red blood cells but 0-2 white blood
cells. White blood count was 9.1 with 75 polyps , 14 lymphs , and
8 monos. Hematocrit was 30.7 , which is at baseline.
EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at 77 , normal axis , normal
intervals and less than 1-mm of ST depression in leads 2 , 3 , V4
through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM AND PROBLEM:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure , likely multifactorial from
obesity-hypoventilation syndrome , sleep apnea , question COPD.
Recurrent decompensation was thought to be precipitated by volume
overload and subsequent pleural effusion. The patient improved
dramatically with aggressive diuresis and he was able to
successfully transition back to use of trache collar during the
day , however , it seems that he does better with ventilatory
support overnight and current permanent plan of care is to
transition patient to home ventilator support such that he will
supplemental oxygen either by nasal cannula or trache collar
during the day and be able to use the ventilator at night. The
patient was also continued on inhaled steroids and nebulizers.
2. Positive blood culture , 1/4 bottles from blood cultures drawn
on 9/28/06 were positive for Gram-positive cocci and clusters;
however , he was afebrile and with no clinical evidence of
infection , so this was thought likely to be contaminant and no
treatment was given.
3. Fluid overload. As noted , the patient responded very well to
diuresis. He was transitioned to a new stable dose of p.o. Lasix
namely 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. This will need to be adjusted as
needed.
4. Hypertension. The patient was continued on his home regimen
of labetalol and amlodipine on which he did well.
5. Diabetes. The patient was continued on home regimen of
Lantus , however , this was titrated up somewhat due to some
elevated sugars the last few days of his admission. He is sent
out on Lantus 60 mg subcutaneously at bedtime as well as a
regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Nutrition. The patient should follow a cardiac , diabetic
salt restricted and fluid restricted p.o. diet. He does have a
PEG tube for supplemental feeding should he be unable to take
p.o. but at the time of discharge he is doing well with a
mechanical soft diet with the above restrictions.
7. The patient is therapeutically anticoagulated on Coumadin.
Indication is history of DVT. He will be continued on a dose of
3 mg at bedtime. Coumadin should be drawn every two days
initially until it is clear that this is the correct stable dose
for him. It may need to be titrated up or down.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is full code.

Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , Lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , labetalol 200
