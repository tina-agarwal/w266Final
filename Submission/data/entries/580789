Fever.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 36-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes ,
chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis as well as chronic
skin ulcers who was at hemodialysis on the day of admission when
she developed fevers to 101 , chills , and rigors. The patient
also developed diffuse abdominal pain on the afternoon of

questioning reports that she was in her usual state of health
until 2 days prior to admission when she began to have abdominal
cramping with one episode of diarrhea as well as chills. While
she was at hemodialysis on the day of admission , the patient
became febrile with concern for infection and was referred for
evaluation at the Emergency Department.

20 , and 96% on room air. General: The patient is a black woman
with multiple skin ulcers notably over her trunk. Pupils were
equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular muscles were intact. She does have horizontal
nystagmus , sclerae are anicteric , JVP was flat. Chest: Faint
right basilar crackles. Cardiovascular: S1 , S2 normal , II/VI
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. Carotids 2+
without bruit. Abdomen: Decreased bowel sounds , obese , slightly
distended , mildly tender with deep palpation , no rebound or
guarding. Extremities 1-2+ edema , left heel open ulcer with foul
odor and surrounding erythema. Neurological examination grossly
nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Sodium 133 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 45 ,
creatinine 8.2. Serum glucose 507 , white blood cell count 14.4
with 4 bands. Hematocrit 30.3 , platelets 525. Normal liver
function test , lipase 29 normal. Urine hCG negative. INR 1.6.
Urinalysis was slightly positive.
STUDIES: Chest x-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette
concerning for pericardial effusion and bibasilar subsegmental
atelectasis. Left foot x-ray showed evidence of osteomyelitis of
the left calcaneus. Abdominal CT showed diffuse retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy , pulmonary nodules in the left lower lobe as well
as a low attenuation foci associated with a small bowel of
unclear significance. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats
per minute , normal axis with isolated T-wave inversion in V1.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:
1. Status post wound debridement left heel 11/11/06 by Dr.
Ira Pollart , vascular surgery.
2. Status post hemodialysis tunneled catheter placement left
chest 7/23/06 by interventional radiology.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Infectious disease: Line sepsis. The patient was treated
with broad-spectrum antibiotics and initially treated with
vancomycin , ceftazidime , and clindamycin as well as gentamicin.
She underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram that was negative
for valvular vegetation and she showed no stigmata of
endocarditis. She had blood cultures from 8/2/2006 that were
positive for vancomycin resistant enterococcus and her antibiotic
regimen was changed to linezolid and clindamycin to cover for
anaerobes in her left heel. The patient's tunneled hemodialysis
catheter was removed on hospital day #2 in the setting of line
sepsis. The patient remained afebrile and will complete a 21-day
course of linezolid for VRE line sepsis. Repeat blood cultures show no growth
to date. The patient
was also admitted with chronic left heel osteomyelitis. The patient had
plain films that showed evidence of osteomyelitis. The Vascular
Surgery Service was consulted and the patient underwent
debridement of her left heel on 11/11/06 by Dr. Angeloni and Dr.
Kalan . The patient will most likely need a left below-the-knee amputation
in the future most. The patient's wound culture grew out
Morganella morganii. However , in discussion with the Medical
team , the patient was not treated with antibiotic coverage for
this positive wound culture. A vacuum dressing was temporarily
placed to her wound and currently the wound is being treated with
t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressings. The patient did have a chest x-ray
that could have been compatible with an early left lower lobe
pneumonia , and had some low grade fevers during this admission. The patient
will also be discharged on a 10 day course of renally dosed Levaquin to cover
for possible community acquired pneumonia. The patient also had abdominal
pain and fevers on admission and had an abdominal CT scan without evidence of
abdominal abscess or other intraabdominal acute process.
2. Renal: The patient has end-stage renal disease , on
hemodialysis. She had her hemodialysis catheter removal. She
had negative blood cultures from 5/11/06 and the Interventional
Radiology Service placed another left chest tunneled hemodialysis
catheter on 7/23/06 .  The patient was started on Nephrocaps ,
PhosLo as well as Plavix during this admission.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient had an admission chest x-ray
with an enlarged cardiac silhouette. She underwent a
transthoracic echocardiogram that revealed an EF of 55% and
trivial pericardial effusion. She showed no signs of cardiac
tamponade. The patient was continued on low-dose beta-blockade
and her lisinopril was restarted during the admission. She did
have periods of hypertension during the admission , thought to be
in the setting of volume overload. This did improve with
up-titration of her beta-blocker and hemodialysis. She will be
discharged on lisinopril as well as Toprol-XL. She was monitored
on telemetry throughout the admission.
4. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: The patient tolerated a
renal fluid restricted diet. She did have hyperkalemia of 6.3
during the admission , which was treated appropriately. The
patient's hyperkalemia did improve with hemodialysis. The
patient did have difficult peripheral IV access during the
admission. However , she did refuse a central line.
5. Neurology: The patient has a seizure disorder and was
continued on Keppra.
6. Endocrine: The patient upon admission had elevation of her
blood sugars to more than 500. The patient was placed on an
insulin drip , which was titrated off on hospital day #2.
Subsequently , on hospital day #2 , the patient did have periods of
hypoglycemia for which she received amps of D50. The patient's
insulin regimen was adjusted during the admission. Initially ,
she was started on NPH 25 once in the evening and NPH 12 units
once every morning. In addition , regular insulin 6 units before
each meal was added. However , the patient again had periods of
hypoglycemia overnight on 7/23/06 and her insulin regimen was
changed to NPH 12 units subcu b.i.d. with a NovoLog sliding
scale. However , she continued to have periods of hypoglycemia. SHe will be
discharged on NPH 8 units sc qam and qac and qhs coverage with a humalog
sliding scale. She will
be discharged on this regimen and should followup at Bois Tham General Hospital . 
7. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots.
8. Hematology: The patient's hematocrit was at baseline and
stable. The patient did have retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
seen on abdominal CT scan. This will need to be worked up as an
outpatient. This may represent inflammatory changes in the
setting of line sepsis and osteomyelitis however , malignancy will
need to be excluded.
9. Pulmonary: The patient had pulmonary nodules seen on
abdominal CT scan and will need an outpatient follow-up chest CT
to further evaluate these lesions.
10. GI: The patient had a low-attenuation area seen within the
small bowel on CT scan. In discussion with Radiology , we felt
that further imaging as an outpatient could be considered in the
form of either CT enterography or small-bowel follow-through.
They did not feel that this area represented an area of acute
pathology.
11. Wound care: The patient requires t.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing
changes for her left heel. She will need to follow up with
Vascular Surgery in one week at either Ow Community Hospitals , depending on the patient's preference. She
should also have dry sterile dressings placed once daily to her
multiple open dermal ulcers that are chronic.
DISPOSITION: Full code. The patient will have homeVNA services.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS: The patient will need to follow up with
either Vascular Surgery at Tho Medical Center or with Vascular
Surgery , Dr. Sehr at 886-185-4990 at Rohall Health in one week. The patient will need to follow up with
Dr. Cedrick Packingham , 325-246-5253 at Eewood Alum Lopela Community Hospital
Nephrology Department after she is discharged from
rehabilitation. The patient should also follow up with Dr.
??__?? at Boxsan Hospital in two to four weeks. Upon discharge
from rehab , the patient will undergo hemodialysis at Oview Cooau Medical Center , 694-301-9675 in Ale E Fre La Ankrance on
Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays.
