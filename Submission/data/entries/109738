PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy; repair of ventral

hysterectomy , oophorectomy , and tubal ligation.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , albuterol inhaler
2 puffs four times a day as needed , amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at
bedtime , atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily , Lipitor 40 mg p.o. daily ,

units subcutaneously a.c. , Imdur ER 60 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril
40 mg p.o. daily , and oxycodone 5 mg p.o. every six hours as
needed for pain.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a 34-pack-year smoker that quit one year
ago. Denies ETOH or IV drug use.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , her abdomen was both soft
and obese. Tender above the midline incision with induration.
There was no overlying erythema.
LABS: Notable for high white blood cell
count of 20.5 as well as a troponin of 0.16.
Imaging: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a
6.1 x 6-cm loculated abscess adjacent to her current hernia , not
communicating with small bowel , also showed no obstruction.
The patient was admitted to the Istsa Anyi Medical Center Surgery Service. After
reviewing once more the imaging , it was determined that the
abscess was involving the mesh placed during the last ventral
hernia repair. The decision to proceed with an
Interventional Radiology guided percutaneous drainage of the
abscess was done. 98 mL of dark brown
and bloody discharge was extruded from this procedure and sent to microbiology ,
two drains were left in place. Eventually , 2+ Klebsiella pneumoniae grew
sensitive to several
antibiotics , for which her antibiotic therapy was redirected to
levofloxacin. On 11/6/07 , the patient was taken
to the operating room to remove the infected mesh. A Cardiology
consult had been obtained because of her troponin leak. The event was
determined to be ischemic in nature;
however , given her surgical indication , Cardiology did not
recommend an intervention at the Cath Lab at the moment; however ,
they do recommend that she is followed as an outpatient. The
patient was then taken to the operating room for an abdominal
wound exploration and removal of mesh.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Neuro: The patient did well with p.r.n. morphine and
eventually p.r.n. oxycodone to control her pain. She has a
history of depression , so a Social Work consult was obtained ,
which provided emotional support for the patient.
2. Cardiovascular: She was initially given IV Lopressor
perioperatively and eventually she was restarted on her home
cardiovascular medications. Cardiology continued to follow and
her troponin trended down.
3. Pulmonary: There were no issues.
4. GI: Her diet was going to be advanced , however , on
postoperative day #2 , unfortunately bile was noted to be
seeping out of her abdominal wound , which was interpreted as the
development an enterocutaneous fistula. This was treated with
bowel rest and wet-to-dry dressings initially. Eventually , a VAC
sponge was placed , which after three days was removed and healthy
granulation tissue was appreciated underneath its original place. A new VAC
sponge will be placed once transferred to rehab.
5. GU: Maintenance IVF as needed
6. FEN: A PICC line was placed and TPN was initiated after the
enterocutaneous fistula was identified. TPN is now at goal.
7. Heme: Subcutaneous heparin.
8. Endocrine: Diabetes Service was consulted and a insulin
regimen was initially difficult to achieve due to high blood
glucose measurements initially and brief episodes of hypoglycemia
two days before her discharge. However , her insulin regimen now
appears to be optimal.
9. ID: Initially received vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl
since her admission; however , once the above results were noted ,
this antibiotic regimen was tailored down to a levofloxacin. She
is now being discharged on no antibiotics.
DISCHARGE MEDICATION: Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4 h. as needed for
headache or fever to greater than 101 , aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily ,
albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebs every four hours as needed for
shortness of breath , amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at bedtime as
