BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is a 65 yo w/CHF presenting w/episode of Vtach
at outside hospital. Pt. felt somewhat nauseous on coming home from
work on day PTA. Wife noticed pallor when he came home , called
ambulance. Was found to be in monomorphic Vtach to 200 which responded
to lidocaine. Lidocaine drip d/c'd in AM of transfer in the abscene of
further VT. Pt found to have troponin of 0.8 at
outside hospital. It was initially unclear if the pt had an ischemic
event which caused VT , or if the pt's VT caused a bump in cardiac
enzymes. Pt also has anginal equivalent w/jaw pain which
worsens when the pt carries heavy things or walks
up flights of stairs. Recent outside echocardiogram showed EF 15-20% ,
w/ global hypokinesis. PE onadmission w/JVP 10 cm , faint crackles ,
II/VI SEM worse w/inc. afterload. EKG , unchanged from
0/30 . 
HOSPITAL
COURSE 1. Ischemia - The patient was admitted to the cardiac
service. Given the presence of vtach and a slight EKG bump , and
clinical signs of heart failure , the initial presentation was
suspicious for CAD. The
patient was initially diuresed slowly , however , the pt began to develop
worsening HTN and shortness of breath along w/a prolonged episode of
vtach and was subsequently
diuresed aggressively by approximately 5 L. The patient was also
loaded w/amiodarone. The patient's weight also dropped 5 kg. Left and
right
coronary catheterization were performed and revealed only a discrete rt
PDA lesion 60% and a discrete 60% D1 , otherwise essentially clean. No
interventions were
necessary. The right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP of 6 after
the diuresis. The patient had no further vtach episodes on amiodarone
and was discharged on 400 mg qd of amiodarone.
The patient had an
ICD placed on 10/8/2004 .  The initial plan was for the patient to also
have his aflutter ablated to decrease the propensity for vtach ,
however , the presence of a lt atrial clot could not be ruled out during
TEE , so rhythm ablation was deferred. An transthroracic echocardiogram
was
also performed prior to discharge which revealed EF of 30% , w/anterior
akinesis and global hypokinesis. A broad differential diagnosis for his
heart failure was entertained , however no conclusive etiology could be
determined. The patient is to follow up with his cardiologist and his P
CP. These appointments were coordinated by the attending physician ,
Dr. Versteegh . He should also follow up w/Dr. Yafuso as described in that
section. For the patient's afib , he should take coumadin , 5 mg , for the
next three nights and should subsequently drop down to 2.5 mg qd ,
unless differently as suggested by his INR which should be drawn on
Monday , March , and Wed July by the VNA. The patient should call an
MD immediately w/chest pain , sob , or pallor. The patient's blood
pressure medications were also significantly adjusted to maximum doses
while the patient was under close acute care monitoring to facilitate
optimization of his outpt regimens. Additional changes at the
discretion of the pt's PCP , Dr. Schwarm . The patient also presented w/an
elevated creatinine which slowly returned to normal levels during the
hospitalization. The elevated creatinine was most likely due to a
combination of hypoperfusion secondary to vtach , and dye load from
catheterization.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
F/u as described above. INR on November .  Stop old medications.
Take only medications as prescribed from here.
