diuretic doses. As he became increasingly volume overloaded , he
began to complain of left neck pain and swelling as well as left
lower extremity edema. In addition , his mental status became
increasingly more somnolent and he began to have twitching
movements of his upper extremities. At admission to Burg Hospital , Mr. Roberg denied chest pain , shortness of
breath. He did note approximately four days of left neck pain.
He also denied abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea. He

ALLERGIES:
Mr. Shanafelt has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
His temperature was 96.2 degrees Fahrenheit. His heart rate was
62 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 170/72. His
oxygen saturation was 99% on 2 liters. He was awake and alert
and in no acute distress. His jugular venous pressure was
approximately 12 cm of water. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and a systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border. He did not have any signs of pulses
paradoxes. His lungs had decreased breath sounds at the right
base with rales at the left base. His abdomen was soft and
distended but nontender. There were normoactive bowel sounds.
The extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally at the shins.
His neurologic exam was nonfocal.
LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:
His sodium was 134 and his potassium was 3.4. His chloride was
100 and his bicarb was 21. His BUN was 140 and his creatinine
was 7.0. His white blood cell count was 8.4 and his hematocrit
was 26.1. His INR was 2.5. His calcium was 9.0. His EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 61 beats per minute. This was
a paced rhythm. His chest x-ray showed volume overload and
cardiomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Renal: On admission , Mr. Muraski had significant volume
overload with weight gain , edema , and chest x-ray evidence of
pulmonary edema. He also had significant azotemia with a BUN of
140. His creatinine had also increased from his baseline
creatinine of 5.0 to 7.0 at admission. His physical examination
the morning after admission showed worsening somnolence and slow
asterixis with jerky myoclonic movements. On 10/3/05 , the
tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed in his right internal
jugular vein by interventional radiology. This procedure was
tolerated without complication. Mr. Stahlnecker had his first run of
hemodialysis on 6/15/05 , which he tolerated well with subsequent
improvement in his mental status and resolution of his asterixis.
He again underwent hemodialysis on 7/7/05 , 8/5/05 and
0/28/05. In addition , he underwent a two-hour run of
ultrafiltration on 7/28/05 with removal of nearly four liters of
fluid. Mr. Lavergne will continue with intermittent hemodialysis
on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday schedule after discharge from
Belllit Community Hospital . Plans are underway for Mr. Schroeppel
to have an AV fistula placed. He has a follow-up appointment on
9/15/05 with vascular surgery at F.shands Ieldmormode Hospital .
2. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: Mr. Grassman was maintained
on a renal diet. He was started on Nephrocaps multivitamin. On
6/15/05 , he was started on Phoslo 667 mg t.i.d. for a phosphorus
level of 5.8. However , on 7/28/05 , his phosphorus level was 1.8
and therefore his Phoslo was held.
3. Cardiovascular: Mr. Wallau has a long history of
hypertension and he is treated with multiple medications. His
systolic blood pressures have ranged in the 160-180s during this
admission. He was continued on his Norvasc and labetolol. He
was also continued on hydralazine at 100 mg t.i.d. In addition ,
lisinopril was added and titrated to 10 mg p.o. daily. In
addition , he was continued on his clonidine at 0.6 mg b.i.d. Mr.
Bacus blood pressure did not return to a normal level after he
was dialyzed repeatedly. His blood pressure will need to be
continued to be monitored at rehab with potentially additional
medicines added. In addition , Mr. Mok has a history of
coronary artery disease with recent non-ST elevation MI. He was
initially due to be discharged on 8/5/05 , but shortly after
hemodialysis , he had one 15-minute episode of sharp left-sided
chest pain. He was therefore ruled out for myocardial infarction
with serial enzymes and EKGs. He showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.
4. Hematology: Mr. Buetti is maintained on Coumadin for history
of deep venous thrombosis. When he was first admitted , his
Coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled
hemodialysis catheter. He received one oral dose of vitamin K as
well as fresh frozen plasma prior to placement of the line. He
was subsequently restarted on his Coumadin and it was titrated
while being treated with antibiotics. His previous dose was 4 mg
and he will be discharged on that dose.
5. Endocrine: Mr. Woodburn has a history of diabetes mellitus and
was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Infectious Disease: Mr. Goodyear became febrile to 101 degrees
Fahrenheit on 2/12/05. He was again febrile on 0/28/05. His
urine culture grew out enterobacter cloacae , which was
subsequently found to be pan resistant. Prior to his
sensitivities being obtained , he was treated with levofloxacin.
When it was determined that the enterobacter was resistant to
levofloxacin , he was switched to gentamicin 60 mg IV x1 on
4/17/05. He should receive several additional days of
gentamicin approximately five or six days. He should be dosed
after hemodialysis for a gentamicin level less than 5. Mr.
Montogomery did have one positive blood culture from 3/6/05 that
grew out gram-positive cocci in clusters at the time of this
dictation. There was only one out of four bottles that grew out
these gram-positive cocci. He did receive one dose of vancomycin
in the early morning of 4/17/05. It was felt that this blood
culture most likely represented a contaminant. All of his other
blood cultures remained negative at the time of this dictation.
DISPOSITION:
Mr. Mckean will be discharged to the Westjo Hospital His
blood pressure and INR will need to be monitored. He will
continue on hemodialysis three times per week. He has an
appointment at vascular surgery on 9/15/05 to plan for AV
fistula formation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
He was afebrile. He was alert and conversational. He had
occasional rales at his bases. His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a 1/6 systolic murmur at his left sternal border.
His abdomen had normoactive bowel sounds , it was soft , nontender ,
and nondistended. His extremities were warm and there was no
edema. He showed no signs of uremia with no asterixis.
