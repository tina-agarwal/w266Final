Discharge Date: 5/17/1994
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS: HYPOTENSIVE EPISODE.
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: 1. End stage renal disease on chronic
hemodialysis. 2. Mild mental retardation.
3. Movement disorder ( tics ). 4. Status post parathyroidectomy.
5. Partial thyroidectomy. 6. Status post partial gastrectomy for
peptic ulcer disease. 7. History of MRSA from wound in 1988.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46-year-old
gentleman with end stage renal disease
on chronic hemodialysis who was admitted status post fall and
seizure. The patient's end stage renal disease is thought to be
secondary to hypertension , although he has never had a renal
biopsy. He has been on hemodialysis since 1987 , having dialysis
three times a week. His dry weight is about 85 to 86 kilos. His
dialysis has been complicated by multiple episodes in the past of
hypotension and seizure activity occurring after dialysis. These
episodes occur about once a month.
On the day of admission , the patient came home from routine
hemodialysis where he was ultrafiltered 5.5 kilograms of fluid and
his final blood pressure after dialysis was 100/60. At noon , the
patient went home , ate lunch and went up to his room. At that time
he complained of feeling dizzy and sitting on the edge of the bed
told his uncle that he was not feeling well and then slumped onto
the floor. He does not believe that he hurt himself , i.e. , did not
hurt his head , although he did complain of some right foot pain.
He was still conscious as his uncle lifted him back to bed and then
an ambulance was called.
After a few minutes , the patient lost consciousness , rolling his
eyes back with some facial twitching bilaterally and tongue
retraction. This episode lasted about five minutes. There was no
tongue biting , no urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence. The
patient gained full recovery of his alertness upon waking up but
was a bit diaphoretic. His aunt checked his vital signs which were
blood pressure 70/40 , pulse 79. The patient had also complained of
chest pain for a few minutes prior to his episode. When the EMTs
arrived , the patient was alert and oriented times three , cold and
clammy , temperature 98.6 , pulse 89 , respirations 26 , blood pressure
82/60.
The patient was brought to the emergency room and was orthostatic
by blood pressure ( 10 points ) from lying to sitting. He was given
500 ccs of normal saline and was no longer orthostatic , comfortably
sitting up in the bed. At about 9:00 p.m. he complained of feeling
dizzy and became diaphoretic while trying to stand up. The patient
was again brought into bed. He became unresponsive for one minute
with his eyes rolled up and some bilateral face twitching. This
episode only lasted about one minute. The patient was admitted for
observation.
Past medical history reveals the following: 1 ) Mild mental
retardation since about 10 years ago. 2 ) Movement disorder ( tics )
on Stelazine. 3 ) End stage renal disease thought to be secondary
to hypertension. 4 ) Status post parathyroidectomy for secondary
hyperparathyroidism. 5 ) Partial thyroidectomy for goiter
incidentally found at surgery. 6 ) Status post partial gastrectomy
for peptic ulcer disease in the 1960's. 7 ) History of MRSA from
wound in 1988. 8 ) Hepatitis B surface antibody positive and
hepatitis C virus positive. Medications on admission: Calcium
carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid; nephrocaps , 1 PO qd; DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd;
Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. There are no known allergies. Social
history: The patient was a former smoker and has a history of
alcohol abuse but no IV drug use. He lives with his aunt and uncle
and is mildly retarded.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination , vital signs
showed a lying blood pressure of 96/60 ,
pulse 80 , sitting up blood pressure 104/70 , pulse 96 , temperature
97.5 , O2 sat 95% on room air. The patient was a well nourished ,
black male in no apparent distress. HEENT exam was unremarkable.
Neck showed JVD of 4 cms. No lymphadenopathy. Chest was clear to
auscultation. Heart revealed S1 , S2 , normal rate and rhythm with a
1/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.
No CVA tenderness. Abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses. Bowel
sounds were positive. The patient was guaiac negative with brown
stool. Extremities revealed a tender , edematous dorsal aspect of
right foot , with full range of motion at the ankle joint. Left
extremity benign. Neuro exam was grossly nonfocal.
LABORATORY DATA: On admission , sodium 142 , potassium 4.8 ,
chloride 94 , bicarb 32 , BUN 38 , creatinine 8.6 ,
glucose 168. A CBC revealed white count of 8.82 , hematocrit 35 ,
platelets 246. Calcium was 9.7. Chest x-ray revealed mild
pulmonary vascular redistribution with no significant CHF and no
infiltrates. Ankle x-rays on the right revealed no fracture or
dislocation. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 76 ,
axis 2 degrees , some 1 mm ST elevations in I and AVL , T-waves flat
in lead III. The slight elevations in ST were consistent with EKG
on 1/2/94.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was observed overnight and put on
an oral renal diet , checking orthostatics
frequently. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout his
hospital course and remained hemodynamically stable with no
orthostasis. The patient was evaluated by the renal service who
assessed that this episode was most likely secondary to the
extensive fluid removal from dialysis leading to a low blood
pressure. In addition , they noted that seizures and orthostasis
are often seen status post dialysis in some patients. They
recommended no further work up of this seizure episode and
recommended no prophylaxis with an antiepileptic. The patient
underwent dialysis again on 1/25/94 per schedule. After this
dialysis , the patient was asymptomatic , not orthostatic and did not
complain of any light headedness.
As the patient complained of right foot pain , right foot films were
obtained which revealed nondisplaced fractures of the second ,
third , fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. Orthopaedic service was
consulted who put the patient in a bivalve cast with a toe plate.
Physical therapy was consulted. The patient was allowed to sit in
a chair and engage in nonweight bearing activities. His foot was
elevated on three pillows for 72 hours. The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and now awaits placement into a skilled
nursing facility for rehabilitation , given his casted right lower
leg.
DISPOSITION: The patient will be discharged on his medications
from admission which include: 1 ) Nephrocaps , 1 PO
qd. 2 ) Calcium carbonate , 1250 mg PO tid. 3 ) DHT , 0.2 mg PO qd.
4 ) Stelazine , 2 mg PO tid. The patient will be seen again in
orthopaedics clinic on Friday , 7/17/94 at 9:15 a.m. The patient is
discharged in stable condition to a rehab/skilled nursing facility
per wishes of patient , family and per recommendation of physical
therapy.
