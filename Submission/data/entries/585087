ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 35 year-old female , G7 , P3-1-2-3 at
33.2 weeks by a formal ultrasound is admitted
with abdominal pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Abdominal pain: Because the patient had
anorexia , abdominal pain and also some nausea
as well as increased white blood cell count , a Surgery consult was
obtained. They suggested that the patient remain NPO with
intravenous hydration and to follow her serial white counts as well
as serial examinations to rule out appendicitis. The patient was
hungry on the evening of admission. She was given a diet and was
tolerating without any problems. At the time her abdominal
examination was benign. Her white blood cell count went from a
high of 17.7 down to 11.9. At the time of dictation , the current
one is still pending. There does not appear to be any evidence of
appendicitis. There also does not appear to be any evidence of
preterm labor.
2 ) Rule out PET: We do not have the patient's book in blood
pressures since she had no prenatal care , however no admission her
initial blood pressure was 162/60 and with 3+ protein , the patient
was assessed regarding rule out pre-eclampsia. She had no symptoms
during the admission , however did report some headaches recently
and maybe some spotty vision. However , it is reassuring that she
had none of these complaints during the admission. Her blood
pressures on the floor have been reassuring with a blood pressure
maximum when she is on the Fuller Service of 140/70. The patient's
PET laboratory studies were reassuring and the baby has normal
fluid. The patient is currently undergoing 24 hour urine protein
and further determination will be made from then. It is expected
that the patient will be discharged , feeling that the proteinuria
is from her vaginitis.
