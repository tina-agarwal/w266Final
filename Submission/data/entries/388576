Discharge Date: 3/12/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: ANEURYSM REPAIR.
AUTOMATIC IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER
DEFIBRILLATOR PATCH PLACEMENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old white
female , status post large anterior
myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular tachycardia ,
ventricular fibrillation arrest and aneurysm , admitted for surgical
repair and AICD ( automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator )
placement. The patient's cardiac risk factors included
hypertension , increased cholesterol , adult-onset diabetes mellitus ,
positive family history , positive previous myocardial infarction.
Her cardiac course was notable for a large anterior myocardial
infarction on 8 of February .  The patient received recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator and underwent emergent percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty. A left ventriculogram showed
anterior septal dyskinesis and ejection fraction was approximately
20%. The patient had postoperative tamponade requiring
pericardiocentesis. On 8 of February , the patient suffered worsening
congestive heart failure , tachyarrhythmia and required emergent
cardioversion and subsequent medical therapy. She had recurrent
ventricular tachycardia treated with Lidocaine. In 22 of June ,
electrophysiologic studies were performed and the patient was
started on Amiodarone. The patient also underwent transplant
evaluation with cardiac catheterization showing occluded left
anterior descending coronary artery at S1 , right dominant system ,
marked left ventricular dilatation with anterior septal dilatation
and ejection fraction 18%. Right atrial pressures were 60/12/11 ,
right ventricular pressures 56/14 , pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 34 , cardiac index 31. An echocardiogram showed left
atrium 4.9 centimeters , left ventricle with normal wall thickness ,
plus thrombus and mild pericardial effusion , anterior septal
akinesis , hypokinetic left ventricle , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation ,
2+ mitral regurgitation. The patient was admitted at this time for
aneurysm repair. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY revealed coronary artery
disease as above , hiatal hernia , adult-onset diabetes mellitus ,
hypertension , status post total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , status post appendectomy , status
post cholecystectomy. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Micronase
5 milligrams by mouth each day , Amiodarone 200 milligrams by mouth
each day , captopril 37.5 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day ,
Coumadin 2 milligrams by mouth each day. ALLERGIES were to
Halcion , which causes hallucinations. SOCIAL HISTORY revealed the
patient is married with 5 children , 7 grandchildren.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a pleasant ,
middle-aged , white female in no acute
distress. The patient was afebrile , blood pressure 98/60 ,
temperature 98 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation on room air
was 92%. Skin was without lesions. Head , eyes , ears , nose and
throat examination was within normal limits. Neck was supple
without lymphadenopathy , carotids 2+ without bruits , no jugular
venous distention. Chest examination was significant for rales
about 1/3 of the way up from the bases. Cardiac examination
revealed S1 and S2 , positive S3 , II/VI systolic murmur was heard at
the left upper sternal border radiating to the apex. Abdomen was
soft , nontender , nondistended , no organomegaly. Extremities
revealed 2+ pitting edema. Neurologic examination was nonfocal.
Rectal examination revealed normal tone , guaiac negative stool.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Chest x-ray on admission revealed
cardiomegaly , left pleural effusion versus
scarring , mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. The
electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , left atrial
enlargement , low voltages , no change compared to old study of
previous admission. Other laboratory data on admission was
unremarkable.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 17 of January , to the
Surgery Service and the procedure was performed
on 27 of April .  Please see the operation note for description of the
aneurysmectomy and AICD patch placement. The patient was managed
postoperatively on the Surgical Service without complications , and
transferred to the Medical Service 2 days prior to discharge. On
the Medical Service , treatment included removal of the patient's
chest tube , removal of her pacing wires , and captopril was
increased to a final dose of 37.5 milligrams.
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. MEDICATIONS ON
DISCHARGE included Coumadin 2 milligrams by mouth
each day , Bactrim-Double-Strength 1 by mouth twice a day times 6
days , Amiodarone 200 milligrams by mouth each day , Micronase 5
milligrams by mouth each day , captopril 37.5 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE was stable. The patient was
to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. Shad Bozard in 4 weeks , and with Dr. Royce M. J Stockham . The patient was to have her prothrombin time and partial
thromboplastin time checked at her local Coumadin Clinic.
