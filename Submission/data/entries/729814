Discharge Date: 10/19/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
PROBLEMS DURING ADMISSION: 1 ) MIGRAINE HEADACHE.
2 ) NONSPECIFIC ABDOMINAL PAIN.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35 year old female
who carries a diagnosis of lupus for
seven years , recently discharged with a pulmonary embolism and deep
vein thrombosis , on Coumadin and Lovenox , now returns with a
complaint of new onset chest pain and sob. Previously the patient has been
stable with her SLE but had started Plaquenil recently. On
5/30/99 she presented to her rheumatologist complaining of
intermittent leg swelling for the past year and was found to have
left superficial femoral and gastrocnemius DVT. She was about to
begin Lovenox when she mentioned that she had also experienced
occasional pleuritic chest pain over the last five years. She then had a V/Q
scan which was read as intermediate probability for PE. For definitive
diagnosis , a pulmonary angiogram was done on 7/9/99 showing bilateral apical
small pulmonary emboli.She was treated with IV heparin and was started on
Coumadin to a therapeutic INR of 2.0. She also had an unremarkable
echocardiogram at that time. On 10/1/99 , the patient returned
with increasing wheezing and shortness of breath. Her INR was 1.8.
Work up revealed an intermediate probability right-sided V/Q
mismatch with a probable new PE. Repeat echocardiogram showed no right
heart strain. It was thought that she had had a recurrent PE in
the setting of subtherapeutic INR. LE DVT was stable on the LENIs.
She was discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin to obtain a goal INR of
3.0. Unfortunately , two days prior to admission , the patient again
noted increased dyspnea on exertion. She has otherwise been
active , feeling well over the past week. She denies chest pain ,
leg pain , wheezing. V/Q scan performed on the morning of admission
showed new mismatched lesions at the left posterior base and right
anterior base. She notes stomach upset for the previous four days ,
recently had an upper GI work up , including an EGD which was
negative by patient's report. She denies any melena , nausea ,
vomiting , BRPPR. She has been tolerating p.o.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) SLE x 7 years , on Plaquenil recently.
2 ) Migraine headaches. 3 ) History of DVT.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: An obese , pleasant , female in no acute
distress. Pulse 87. Blood pressure 118/50.
Saturation 97 percent on room air. Afebrile. HEENT: Oropharynx
is clear. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly or
JVD. Lungs are clear to auscultation except scattered rales at the
right base. Heart normal S1 and S2. A II/VI systolic ejection
murmur at the left upper sternal border. Abdomen - large , obese ,
nontender , nondistended. Extremities - no palpable cords or edema.
Neurologic - alert and oriented , no focal deficits.
LABORATORY DATA: Creatinine 0.7 , WBC 105 , hematocrit 40 , platelets
307. Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at
86. Normal intervals and axis. No ST-T wave abnormalities.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient was
placed on intravenous heparin and the Lovenox and Coumadin were
discontinued in anticipation for an IVC filter placement the
following morning. She also received intravenous dihydroergotamine
for migraine headaches with good effect by the following morning.
The following morning , the patient received 2 units of FFP because
her INR was 3.0. The decision to place a filter was postponed and
instead a pulmonary angiogram was performed. This revealed no
obvious recurrent pulmonary embolism. The morning
of 5/30/99 , prior to the angiogram , two
events occurred. First event , the patient was walking to the
bathroom and her heart rate was noted to go at 140 beats per minute
and was approximately sinus tachycardia or supraventricular
tachycardia. This resolved after 45 seconds without intervention
and did not recur and there were no associated symptoms and the
patient was unaware of the event. The second event occurred about
one hour later and the patient noted approximately 5/10 sharp right
lower sternal border chest pain which was not pleuritic and not
positional and resolved spontaneously over the next 5 minutes and
did not recur. She also had some abdominal pain. She tolerated p.o.'s without
any gastrointestinal
symptoms throughout and the pain was mild with a benign abdominal
exam. This will be pursued by her outpatient physician , if
indicated. The patient was resumed on Coumadin 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.
as well as Lovenox in the interim 100 mg subcu b.i.d. until she
achieves a therapeutic INR which was determined by Cardiology to be , 3.5 ,
given that she has not
had a recurrent PE. Throughout her stay she remained afebrile and
with a saturation of approximately 94-95 percent on room air ,
breathing comfortably.
FOLLOWUP: She will follow up with her primary care doctor and have
her INR checked in two days.

Plaquenil 200 mg p.o. q. d.; Coumadin 10 mg
p.o. q. h.s.; Lovenox 100 mg subcu q. 12h..
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged home. She will follow up
with her primary care doctor within one week.
