ATTENDING: SID GIL KIJOWSKI MD
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , the patient is a
76-year-old woman with coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft in 1992 who was recently admitted
with non ST elevation MI/congestive heart failure at which time
catheterization revealed an increased wedge with decreased
patency in both venous grafts and a patent LIMA graft with
collaterals. The patient has an extensive past medical history
of hypercholesterolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , insulin
dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease status post multiple
MI , CABG , hypertension , degenerative joint disease , CVA , gout ,
schizoaffective disorder , tardive dyskinesia and hypothyroidism.
At her baseline she has been staying at the Wrangcon Ronhomar Memorial Hospital and on
admission was complaining of chest pressure since waking , similar
to the pressure she felt during a prior admission. She had a
certain amount of shortness of breath , some nausea , two episodes
of vomiting and her symptoms were not responsive to nitroglycerin
tablets at the Harpa Vensports Center The patient came to the Ter Health Emergency Department where she reported that her
chest pressure had resolved. She was treated with IV TNG. In
the Emergency Department she was also treated with Lopressor ,
aspirin , IV trinitroglycerin and was heparinized. The patient
then pulled out the lines. Her admission vitals were significant
for a blood pressure of 180/90. The patient had a heart rate of
86 , was afebrile and was breathing at 100% at 2 liters. She had
an elevated JVP , had clear sounding lungs , trace edema and at the
left upper sternal border and left lower sternal border a
systolic ejection murmur II-III/VI was heard with S1 and S2.
Admission labs were significant for an elevated creatinine of
2.0. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient had elevated
platelets from a baseline of 30 to 80 to 673 on admission , a
white count of 9.3 , hematocrit of 35. EKG was notable for a Q3
which had been seen on a prior EKG. T-wave inversions also seen
on a prior EKG. The patient had an echo on 1/21 which showed
concentric LVH with an EF of 30-35% , posterolateral and inferior
akinesis was also seen. A calcified aortic valve with trace AI
and mild MR was seen. On 4/20 , the patient had catheterization
which showed that her circulation was right dominant with an LAD
90% and 100% lesions , left circumflex with 100% lesion , RCA with
100% lesions. She had an SVG to PDA graft with 100% lesion , SVG
to circumflex graft with 85% lesion stented to 10% at that time.
She had a LIMA to LAD graft which was patent , and she had lots of
collaterals. The right heart cath was significant for a wedge of
39 and a PA of 75/34 and right atrial pressure of 14 and a
cardiac index of 1.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By system ,
1. Ischemia: The patient was initially treated with aspirin ,
beta blockers , statin , Plavix , Heparinized and was ruled out with
enzymes. On the first day of hospitalizations , the patient's
heparin was stopped , the patient's IV trinitroglycerin was
stopped as well. The patient was started on nadolol and that
dose was increased to 80 q.day which the patient tolerated well
and seemed to control the patient's blood pressure and heart rate
reasonably well. The patient's attending felt that the patient
was a poor candidate for catheterization and other interventions
and would not benefit significantly from it. The symptoms the
patient was having was similar she was having during a prior
hospitalization which had ended just two days before this
admission. It was felt that her nausea , vomiting and chest
pressure were probably noncardiac in nature. The only change in
the patient's cardiac medications at the time of discharge is an
increase in nadolol to 80 mg q.day.
Rhythm: The patient's rhythm was monitored on telemetry for most
of her stay during this hospitalization. Significant events were
not observed.
Pump: The patient was continued at her regular dose of
outpatient medications which seemed to be effective. The patient
had multiple complaints of chest pain/pressure during her
hospitalization which resulted in periodic examinations and EKGs.
All of these workups were negative.
2. GI: On 3/23 it was noted that the patient had an increased
white count of 16 , 000. Also on exam on that day it was noted
that the patient had marked right upper quadrant abdominal
tenderness and fullness. She was not tender anywhere else in her
abdomen. Abdominal exam was also significant for a central mass
representing an umbilical hernia. At that time , General Surgery
consult was called. Lipase and amylase were sent off. They were
negative. Liver function tests were also in the normal range at
that time. Surgery felt that the patient was a poor surgical
candidate given her comorbidities at that time but did recommend
a cholecystectomy in the future. They recommended initial
antibiotic course of amp , Levo and Flagyl which she was started
on. They also recommended making the patient NPO treated her
with Pepcid and giving her adequate IV hydration. The major
intervention they suggested was a cholecystectomy tube by
Interventional Radiology which was placed on the night of
9/18/04. On 6/4 , the patient's white count was down to 10 with
a Tmax of 100 , and at the time of discharge the patient had a
white count in the normal range around 7 and was also afebrile.
Surgery followed the patient during her stay in the hospital as
did Interventional Radiology. Bile was sent out for culture
which showed yeast as well as a gram stain which showed gram
positive cocci. The patient's antibiotics were switched to
Vancomycin , Levo and Flagyl. Initially the Vancomycin and Flagyl
were given IV and the Levo was given p.o. One day prior to
discharge , the patient's Flagyl was switched to p.o. and on the
day of discharge the Vancomycin was stopped after the patient had
received seven days of Vancomycin. The patient will be
discharged on Flagyl p.o. and Levo p.o. The patient was also
started no Fluconazole 100 to treat the yeast that was noted in
her bile cultures. The IR drain will need to be in the patient's
gallbladder for a minimum of six weeks or until the patient has
her elective cholecystectomy which will be scheduled at a later
date.
3. ID: The patient is colonized with MRSA and appropriate
precautions were taken and the patient was also noted to have an
infection in her gallbladder and was treated for it as such.
4. Pain: The patient was treated for abdominal pain during her
stay in the hospital with Demerol and also with Morphine.
5. Psychiatry: The patient was seen by Psychiatry on admission
to help manage her agitation and delirium. They did a
preliminary assessment of the patient. The patient did show
certain signs of agitation and multiple code grays had to be
called on the patient for difficult behavior , though the patient
was never in danger of truly hurting herself or others.
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac chest pain.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis now resolved.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: ASA 325 , Colace 100 b.i.d. , Lasix 80
b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , Levoxyl 175 , nadolol 80 , Lipitor
80 q.h.s. , Lantis 18 units , Diovan 80 , levofloxacin 500 every 24
hours to complete a 14 day course , Fluconazole 100 to complete a
14 day course , Flagyl 500 t.i.d. to complete a 14 day course ,
Plavix 75 , famotidine 20 b.i.d. , iron 325 q.day.
