Discharge Date: 4/11/1997
SERVICE: Walk Verlsa Tempeh
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CARDIOMYOPATHY.
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: None.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient was admitted with a one month history
of increasing shortness of breath , decrease in
exercise tolerance , and two week history of indigestion , diarrhea ,
and mild abdominal discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Vergara is a 29 year old
gentleman with familial cardiomyopathy
diagnosed at age 18. Cardiac catheterization in 1987 revealed a
PCWP 13 , CI 3.8 , no coronary artery disease or valvular problems ,
and a moderately enlarged diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle , EF
31%. , RA 8 , PA 27/12 , SVR 779. Approximately four to six years
ago , he began having increased shortness of breath and was started
on digoxin , Lasix , and Vasotec at that time. A follow-up echo in
1993 revealed an EF of 25% to 30% with moderate dilation of all
four heart chambers , left atrial size of 4.2 with 2+ TR and 3+ MR.
ETT on November 1994 was 9 minutes and 4 seconds in duration
revealing only nonspecific 1 mm ST depression , V4 through V6 , and
MV O2 of 17.0 ml/min/kg. He continued on his medical regimen until three
months prior to this hospital admission when he began to lose
weight ( approximately 35 lbs. at this time by the patient's
report ) , and one month ago , he noticed that he was increasingly
short of breath. He has two pillow orthopnea which has not
changed. He has occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
occasional palpitations. He denies any chest pain or peripheral
edema. He also notes that his exercise tolerance has been greatly
decreased. His Lasix dose was increased recently in clinic as
well. Furthermore , beginning approximately two weeks prior to
admission , he began to complain of indigestion , diarrhea ,
intermittent nausea and vomiting , and abdominal pain. He has had
multiple watery brown stools each day without hematochezia , melena
or fevers. He presented to the Emergency Department four days
prior to admission with these complaints with negative workup at
that time. Most recent Echo on March revealed EF at 24%
with global decreased function , 3+ TR , 4+ MR , left atrial size 5.7 ,
right ventricular enlargement with peak RV pressure greater than
58 , and no thrombus. Last ETT on 4/27 was 7 minutes and 31 seconds
in duration. MV O2 of 15.9 with peak uptake above the anaerobic
threshold.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above , also status post appendectomy and
tonsillectomy in the past.
MEDICATIONS: Vasotec 5 q. day; Lasix 80 mg q. day: digoxin 0.25 mg
q. day.
ALLERGIES: NKDA.
HABITS: Occasional ETOH on weekends , approximately three to four
beers. Positive tobacco use approximately one pack per
day times ten years which he reports to have stopped two weeks ago.
Also history of marijuana use which he has stopped two weeks ago.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for a mother , sister , brother , and
numerous other relatives with cardiomyopathy.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is a thin white male in no acute
distress. Blood pressure 108/80 , pulse 89
and regular , respirations 22 , temperature 99.3. O2 sat 95% on room
air. Weight 70.5 kg. HEENT: Benign. NECK: CVP is 10 cm;
however pulses are 2+ without bruit. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. HEART: Notable for regular rate and rhythm; III/VI
holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla; S3 and S4 present;
apical end pulses inferolaterally displaced and enlarged. ABDOMEN:
Palpable pulsatile liver which is 3 cm below the costal margin ,
nontender. Abdomen is nontender , nondistended with good bowel
sounds present. No splenomegaly. EXTREMITIES: No edema present.
Extremities warm and dry with 2+ pulses bilaterally. Tinea
infection present in the axilla and groin. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and
oriented time three. Cranial nerves III-XII were grossly intact.
Motor strength was 5/5 throughout. Toes are downgoing bilaterally.
LABORATORY STUDIES: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 99 ,
bicarbonate of 28 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1 ,
glucose 91 , ALT 249 , AST 140 , LDH 228 , alk phos 48 , total bilirubin 1.2 ,
direct bilirubin 0.6. White blood cell count 5.4 , hematocrit 35.2 ,
platelets 186. Albumin 3.2 , uric acid 10.3. EKG is normal sinus
rhythm at 97. No ST changes or Q waves present. Positive LVH.
Chest x-ray was without edema or infiltrate. Cardiomegaly is
present. Enlarged pulmonary arteries. Cardiac catheterization
revealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at 28 , pulmonary artery
70/30 , RV 70/8 , right atrium 12 , mixed venous saturation 45% , SVC
saturation 95%.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Following cardiac catheterization , Mr. Estevane
was admitted for tailored therapy , and was
started on nitroprusside in addition to IV diuresis with Lasix ,
Captopril , and Isordil. Digoxin was continued , and he was sodium
and fluid restricted. He was also admitted for a transplant
evaluation. As part of his workup , hepatitis serologies were sent ,
as well as out of concern for his elevated LFTs. These were
negative , except for a borderline hepatitis B antibody. LFTs
gradually decreased throughout his hospitalization , and were likely
elevated due to passive congestion due to heart failure. Also
alcohol use is possible but less likely due to the pattern of
elevated LFTs.
By the next day following nitroprusside therapy overnight , his SVR
had decreased to 1000 with cardiac output of 4.71 , CVP was
decreased to 9 , and he had significant diuresis as further
evidenced by his weight loss. Captopril and Isordil doses were
increased while weaning nitroprusside for a goal systolic blood
pressure greater than 80 to 90 and SVR less than 1200. His GI
complaints resolved immediately upon admission. He had no further
episodes of diarrhea , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting. Thus , no
further workup was done at this time. Of note , he was on Fannie
Rippel protocol and was randomized to hemodynamic therapy.
Captopril was increased to final dose of 50 mg q.i.d. with Isordil
increased to 20 mg t.i.d. Nitroprusside was weaned off on 9/20/97.
IV Lasix was switched to p.o. on 9/20/97.
By 0/21/97 , he continued to feel very well without any complaints
of dyspnea on exertion , light-headedness , dizziness , or shortness
of breath. He did begin to complain of cough , possibly productive
of clear sputum , beginning on this day. He did have one episode of
a four beat run of asymptomatic nonsustained V-tach which was
well-tolerated.
On March , he had a repeat ETT which he completed in 5 minutes and 40
seconds. It was stopped secondary to leg fatigue with a max heart of 132.
EKG was without changes on exercise. Peak V. O2 of 14.3 and without ischemia.
Lasix dose was optimized with final dose of 40 mg p.o. Cough continued , and a
chest x-ray was obtained which was negative for infiltrate. Sputum was sent
and was also negative. He felt that the symptom might be due to post nasal
drip which he has had in the past , and this symptom will have to be followed.
As part of his transplant workup , an abdominal ultrasound was negative ,
although of note , his gallbladder could not be optimally visualized due to a
contraction of the gallbladder. A repeat ETT was as mentioned above.
Echocardiogram revealed LV dilatation with severe LV dysfunction , EF 15% ,
global hypokinesis , right ventricular dilatation with mild-to-moderate
dysfunction , left atrial enlargement , 3+ MR , 2+ TR with a peak velocity of 3.2
consistent with pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 40 mm greater than right
atrial pressure. Pulmonary function tests revealed SVC of 3.35 , 67% ( FEV1 of
2.78 , 67% ) , FEV1/FVC of 83% , FEF 25-75 68% , FVL CO corrected 85% as predicted.
Hepatitis studies , as mentioned above. CMV: IgG positive , IgM negative. EBV:
IgG positive , IgM negative. Mumps positive , VZV positive. Toxoplasma IgG
borderline , low positive; IgM negative. PPD with mumps and Candida control
were placed on 8/27/97 , and the patient was to return to the hospital on
10/3/97 to be examined.
By March , 1997 , the patient was feeling extremely well , and
ambulating without difficulty. He had improved energy and
appetite , and was afebrile. He denied any shortness of breath ,
chest pains , palpitations , and was felt to be stable for discharge.
PROCEDURES: He underwent an echocardiogram on 8/27/97 , ETT
8/27/97 , abdominal ultrasound 8/27/97 , pulmonary
function test 8/27/97 , cardiac catheterization 0/20/97.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Captopril 50 mg p.o. q.i.d.; Isordil 20 mg
p.o. t.i.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day with
instructions that if his weight increased by three to four pounds ,
he should take 80 mg of Lasix that day; Lotrimin 1% cream topical
b.i.d.; and digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.
DIET: He was also discharged on a 2 gram sodium diet with 2 liter
fluid restriction.
FOLLOW-UP: He will return to the hospital on 10/3/97 to have his
PPD and controls read by myself. He will also
follow-up with Dr. Giallorenzo in clinic in two weeks.
