Discharge Date: 9/4/1998
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CHEST PAIN.
PROBLEM LIST: 1 ) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
2 ) HYPOTHYROIDISM.
3 ) PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 70 year-old woman who
had coronary artery bypass graft in
1993 who presents with ten minutes of acute chest pain today. In
November of 1992 , she had quadruple bypass surgery with LIMA to the
LAD and saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM2 and diagonal branch.
She was feeling generally well until the beginning of May at
home. From November , 1997 to March , 1997 , she was in
O and began to experience intermittent episodes of diaphoresis.
These tended to occur with ambulation on a flat surface , although
she did have one episode that awakened her from sleep. The second
time this happened , she went to the Faxtpaul Dekan Health Care there in Ton
with the complaints of diaphoresis and some nausea , although she
did not have chest pain , shortness of breath , vomiting or
palpitations. No EKG was done at the time. She said that she was
definitely more comfortable lying or sitting than standing. It is
of note that she had had her Beta blocker , Pendalol decreased from
5 mg to 2.5 mg prior to this trip to Glension Street On return to the
Gene Er Za , she had upper respiratory and pharyngeal symptoms
with low grade fevers and a cough productive of a green sputum.
This was treated with Amoxicillin given to her by her son who is a
pharmacist. These symptoms gradually resolved and she saw Dr.
Jessie on January , 1997 and was given a clean bill of health.
At this visit , he did start her on Prinivil. Since she had been
home from Er Dr. , Win Ca S , she really had not had repeat episodes of
diaphoresis. Then on the day of admission when she went shopping
and had a recurrent episode of diaphoresis while carrying bags ,
this time with substernal chest pain that radiated down both arms.
She also had a general sense of heaviness across her chest. She
drove home and took a sublingual nitroglycerin that completely
resolved her pain. She describes this pain as exactly like the
anginal pain that she had prior to her coronary artery bypass
graft. The total duration of this episode was approximately ten
minutes. By the time she presented to the Emergency Room , she had
no diaphoresis and no chest pain and was feeling perfectly normal.
The latest echocardiogram in May of 1997 showed an ejection
fraction of 35% with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis and
inferior akinesis with mild mitral regurgitation. In August of
1997 , she went 4 minutes and 18 seconds on an exercise tolerance
test with Thallium which showed only fixed defects , no reversible
defects.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease and
coronary artery bypass graft with cardiac
risk factors of hypertension , family history and high cholesterol ,
hypothyroidism and remote peptic ulcer disease with history of
cholecystectomy and appendectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Zocor 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 2 ) Prinivil
5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Pendalol 2.5 mg
p.o. q. day. 4 ) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 5 ) Synthroid 0.100
mg p.o. q. Monday , Wednesday and Friday and 0.12 mg p.o. Tuesday ,
Thursday , Saturday and Sunday. 6 ) Pepcid p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in Full Quer Dienson with her husband and
has two married sons. She does not smoke and
drinks wine occasionally.
FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 58
and her brother had a coronary artery bypass graft
at age 79 and she has a sister with Alzheimer's disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is a pleasant , elderly woman in
no apparent distress. Vital signs:
Temperature 99.4 degrees , heart rate 87 , blood pressure 115/78 ,
respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The rest
of the physical examination was significant for a clear oropharynx.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular
examination was regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 and a two out of
six systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border with
no gallop or rub. Abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema. Neurological examination was
non-focal. Rectal examination was guaiac negative with no masses.
LABORATORY: Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood
cell count of 5.46 , hematocrit 40.1 , platelets 190.
Cardiac Troponin I was 0.0. CK was 102. Urinalysis was negative.
Chest x-ray was clear with no infiltrates. EKG was normal sinus
rhythm with normal intervals and normal axis with a left bundle
branch block pattern and first degree atrioventricular block with
no change compared to an EKG done on January , 1997.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The impression on admission was that this is a
woman with known coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft who is now experiencing unstable
angina with diaphoretic episodes , both at rest and exertion and now
substernal chest pain. She ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
On May , 1998 , she had a standard Bruce exercise tolerance
test in which she went 3 minutes , 30 seconds and stopped because of
chest pain. This was typical of anginal pain and resolved eight
minutes into recovery. The EKG had no changes with a left bundle
branch block at baseline and this was considered to be consistent
with but not diagnostic of ischemia. She subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed patent grafts with her known
underlying native disease. Her right atrial pressure was 4 , right
ventricular 46/8 , PA 42/22 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 19.
From here , she was managed medically with increases in her ACE
inhibitor , Statin and the addition of nitrates. After the cardiac
catheterization , she developed a large right groin hematoma at the
puncture site and a bruit was noted. An ultrasound was done that
revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the common femoral artery. She was
followed by Vascular Surgery and on March , 1998 , had a
follow-up ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a
pseudoaneurysm in her common femoral artery measuring 2 X 1.5 cm
surrounded by a large hematoma. On March , 1998 , the patient
underwent surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm without any
complications and she was discharged on January , 1998 with
follow-up with both Dr. Polito of Vascular Surgery and Dr. Khat ,
her cardiologist.
