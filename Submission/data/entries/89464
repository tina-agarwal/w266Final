weakness bilaterally and urinary incontinence. It was felt at that
time by neurosurgery and neurology to be multifactorial and no
consistent with disk or cord impingement. There was a work up at
that time including B12 , ANA and HIV all of which were negative.
EMG showed decreased recruitment in the tibialis anterior and
gastrocnemius bilaterally. His rectus femoris were normal
bilaterally. He was treated for a urinary tract infection at that
time with Bactrim for resolution of his incontinence and he was not
anticoagulated by his primary care physician. Since discharge he
noted continued right greater than left lower extremity weakness
otherwise at baseline health until two weeks prior to admission
when he noted some lumbar and sacral pain , nonradiating , worse
while moving his right leg. Over the past few days he noted also
increasing urinary frequency without burning or urinary
incontinence , no fever or chills and no costovertebral angle
tenderness or pain. No bowel incontinence or perianal numbness or
pain. The night of admission , at 7:30 p.m. while getting up from a

236. His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and positive leukocyte
esterase with 15-20 white blood cells , one plus bacteria and one
plus squamous cells.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological: The neurology service came by
to see the patient in the Emergency Room and felt
that there was no acute neurologic change but if the patient was
unable to walk he should be sent to rehabilitation. They saw no
new acute change and he should continue to be followed by neurology
in clinic.
2. Cardiac: He does have a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and echocardiogram with decreased ejection fraction
was noted previously. He will be started on a trial of Lasix p.o.
q day to decrease his peripheral edema to help him with
rehabilitation and his primary care physician will continue to
follow him for his atrial fibrillation and he does elect not to
anticoagulate him at the moment though Coumadin should be a
consideration given his risk of stroke.
3. Skin care: Right calf demonstrates a pressure ulcer and the
patient should apply Nystatin powder for his pannus rash.

treated with seven days of Bactrim and follow urine cultures.
