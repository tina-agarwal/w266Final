HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 38-year-old female with a history of asthma , type II
diabetes mellitus , obesity , depression , and iron deficiency
anemia who presented to Erta Memorial Hospital on 4/15/06
complaining of worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness
over the past three days after running out of her asthma
medications approximately two weeks ago. The patient had ran out
of her Advair , albuterol , and Singulair as well as her Lasix.
She denied any fevers or chills , no nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,
chest pain , or cough. She did report some increased lower
extremity edema over the past several days and admits to not
taking her Lasix. She went to SWORTHLATE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER urgernt care on the day of admission and was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 84% on room air and she was
sent to the Emergency Room for admission. In the ED , she
received nebulizer treatments and prednisone 60 mg x1 and her O2
saturation improved to 95% on 2 liters.
HOME MEDICATIONS:
The patient takes Advair 500/50 b.i.d. , albuterol nebulizers
q.4h. p.r.n. , iron 325 mg t.i.d. , glyburide 2.5 mg daily , Lasix
40 mg p.o. daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , metformin 850 mg
b.i.d. , Prozac 40 mg daily , Singulair 10 mg daily , and a
multivitamin daily.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Pertinent for shortness of breath and chest tightness.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
Exam on admission , patient was afebrile. Her pulse was 100 ,
blood pressure 116/70 , respiratory rate 22 , and O2 saturation of
95% on 2 liters. The patient was awake , alert and oriented x3
and in no apparent distress. Her lungs had scattered wheezing
bilaterally with good air movement. Heart with normal S1 , S2 and
tachycardic. Abdomen is obese , soft , nondistended , nontender.
Extremities had 1+ bilateral pitting edema and mild erythema of
her bilateral shins.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:
White blood cell count was 10.6 and hematocrit 30. Chest x-ray
showed a large cardiac silhouette with no evidence of effusion or
infiltrate. The patient had a PE protocol CT which was a
suboptimal study due to poor body habitus but it was negative for
PE , it did show bilateral ground glass opacities and evidence of
air trapping. It also showed moderate hepatomegaly.
PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
The patient had a PECT and she also had pulmonary function tests
performed.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
This is a 38-year-old female with asthma , diabetes , anemia , and
morbid obesity who was admitted with his asthma exacerbation in
the setting of running out of her medications at home.
1. Pulmonary: The patient was started on prednisone 60 mg p.o.
daily and remained on it for approximately seven days. It was
difficult to taper her prednisone due to oxygen desaturations
with ambulation. The patient's oxygen desaturated to 74-84% with
ambulation. The patient , however , was tapered and is currently
on 50 mg daily , of prednisone and will be sent out on a seven-day
taper. She was also continued on her Advair and Singulair. As
mentioned above , she had a PE protocol CT that showed no PE.
However , it was a suboptimal study due to patient's body habitus.
It did show ground glass opacities. Because the patient had
desaturations with ambulation , it was concerned that the patient
possibly had an atypical pneumonia given these ground glass
opacities. She was started on levofloxacin and should complete a
five-day course. The patient was also tested for HIV which was
negative. She had a BNP to rule out any evidence of volume
overload that was contributing to her oxygen desaturations. BNP
was 5. The patient also had hepatitis serologies due to
hepatomegaly seen on PECT and these were negative as well.
Influenza swabs were negative. The patient was seen in consult
by the pulmonary team and they felt that the patient requireed
home oxygen especially at night and with ambulation. The
patient's O2 saturation while sleeping was 84%. It is highly
suspected that the patient has a component of sleep apnea and she
is to be set up for an outpatient sleep study. Pulmonary also
recommended obtaining a pulmonary function test. These were done
and it showed an FVC of 51% and an FEV1 of 49% and an FEV-FVC
ratio of 97% as well as a total lung capacity of 53% and a DLCO
of 82%. Pulmonary function tests were consistent with
restrictive disease and this is likely due to patient's obesity.
The patient most likely has obesity hypoventilation. We spoke
with her in depth about the importance of losing weight to help
improve her respiratory status as well as her overall health.
The patient is scheduled to have an outpatient sleep study and
she is also to follow up with her outpatient pulmonologist , Dr.
Dworaczyk Home oxygen was set up for the patient as well.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was continued on her lisinopril
and her Lasix was resumed for her lower extremity edema. This
did improve throughout her hospitalization. A lipid panel was
checked and this was in the normal range. The patient should be
started on aspirin given her diabetes and her hypertension.
However , she has been experienced menorrhagia and is anemic so
the aspirin should be started as an outpatient after her
menorrhagia is addressed.
3. Hematology: The patient was found to be iron deficient by
labs and she was continued on iron supplements three times a day.
The patient also complains of heavy menstruation and she has a
history of uterine fibroids , she was supposed to follow up with
GYN as an outpatient but missed her appointment. She was
instructed to follow up with GYN.
4. Endocrine: The patient's home medications of glyburide and
metformin were held and she was placed on NPH 25 units b.i.d.
with a NovoLog sliding scale and 12 units q.a.c. Her hemoglobin
A1c was 7. She was resumed on her home regimen at discharge.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient received Lovenox and Nexium for
prophylaxis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:
The patient was awake , alert , oriented x3. She is 95% on room
air at rest but did continue to desaturate into the 80s with
ambulation. She is awake , alert , oriented x3. Her lungs were
clear bilaterally. There were no other pertinent findings on
exam at discharge.
CONSULTANTS DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
Pulmonary was Dr. Koeppl
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient was sent home on albuterol inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ,
ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Prozac 40 mg p.o. daily ,
Advair Diskus 500/50 one puff b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily ,
glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. daily , Levaquin 750 mg p.o. daily , x1 more
dose , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , metformin 850 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily , Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily , and a
prednisone taper 40 mg daily x2 days , then 30 mg daily x2 days ,
then 20 mg daily x2 days , then 10 mg daily x2 days , then stopping
it and multivitamin one tablet daily.
INSTRUCTIONS ON DISCHARGE:
The patient was encouraged to follow up with GYN as an outpatient
regarding her uterine fibroids and menorrhagia. A follow-up
appointment was scheduled with both her primary care physician
and Dr. Saneaux in February She met with Nutrition during the
hospitalization and had a long conversation with the medical team
regarding weight loss strategies.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES:
The patient is a full code.
