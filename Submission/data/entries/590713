Discharge Date:
ATTENDING: MICHAELS , TYRELL MERLIN MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Coronary artery disease , left ventricular
aneurysm.
PROBLEM LIST:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Atrial fibrillation.
3. Coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly , this is a 64-year-old
gentleman with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction in
1976 with resultant left ventricular aneurysm and congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of approximately 20%. He
has had increasing chest pain with exertion over the last
several years , which led to an evaluation for ischemia.
Catheterization at the Ville Tionsgon County Hospital in Flint Ent Nyjer showed a 70% left
main lesion and a previously known 100% LAD , OM and RCA disease.
The patient had previously undergone a SPECT thallium scan
1/12/06 in Moineslumvale Ri Cons , which showed a large anterior anteroseptal
infarct involving the septum , anterior wall and apical walls that
were entirely scarred and the lateral wall viability
was unclear on that scan. A chest CT performed in March of 2006 showed a
large left ventricular dilation with remodeling and calcified and
thinned left ventricular apex. His past history is also notable
for a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia dating back
to 1983. He had his first AICD placed in 1990 at Woodtwin Memorial Hospital
and this was replaced at the PMC in 1993 with a rate-sensing lead via
the left subclavian vein , and in 1997 , a CPI mini AICD was
placed. On presentation on this admission , he did not have a
history of angina , but did have a history of class III heart
failure with marked limitation of physical activity. He was in
atrial fibrillation , which is his baseline rhythm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As mentioned above , includes also diabetes
with oral treatment only , hypothyroidism , dyslipidemia and gout.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: His past surgical history is notable for
a cholecystectomy in 80s and ICD placed via an open chest in
1990 , replacement in 1992 and in 1997 , appendectomy , right
inguinal hernia repair in 1986.
FAMILY HISTORY: His family history is unremarkable , no history
of coronary artery disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has an eight-pack year cigarette
smoking history. He has an alcohol intake of two drinks per
month and the patient was formerly a dentist.
ALLERGIES: His allergies include erythromycin giving a rash ,
amiodarone with a suspected pulmonary toxicity and elevated LFTs.

1. Toprol 25 mg p.o. daily.
2. Valsartan 80 mg p.o. daily.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
4. Isosorbide 30 mg b.i.d.
5. Aspirin 81 mg daily.

14. Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Notable for this gentleman
who was 5 feet 10 inches and 95 kg in no acute distress. His
vital signs were temperature of 97.8 , heart rate of 70 , blood
pressure of 122/70 and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He had
no detectable carotid bruits. Examination of the chest was
notable for a midline sternotomy scar that was well healed and an
irregular rhythm. No murmurs were appreciated. His breath
sounds were clear and equal bilaterally. His abdomen was notable
for scars from a previous right cholecystectomy and a left lower
quadrant incision for placement of ICD. There were no masses and
the abdomen was soft and nontender. His extremities were without
scaring or edema and he did not have varicosities present.
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: An echocardiogram performed at the
Beauton Geson Health Care Services on 8/2/06 showed an ejection
fraction of 25% with mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspid
insufficiency and an AICD wire in the right heart.
OPERATION PROCEDURES: On 7/14/06 , the patient underwent a
mitral valve repair with an Alfieri suture , a CABG x3 with a
Y-graft saphenous vein; SVG2 connects SVG1 to LVB1 , SVG1 connects
to aorta to OM1 , SVG3 to ramus , a left ventricular aneurysm
repair and epicardial lead placement. The bypass time was 257
minutes. The cross-clamp time was 98 minutes.
ICU COURSE:
1. Neurologic: The patient was brought to the Intensive Care
Unit from the operating room on a propofol drip. He was
adequately sedated. Sedation was weaned and he was extubated
without incident. The patient's pain was well controlled with
p.r.n. Toradol. This was transitioned over to Motrin and he was
taking p.o.s and p.r.n. Morphine. He also was continued on his
own dose of Clonazepam 2.5 mg b.i.d. He was neurologically
intact throughout the course of his ICU stay and he was
transferred to floor with no focal deficits , moving all
extremities and pain that is well controlled.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient was brought to the ICU on
Neosynephrine , epinephrine and milrinone drips. The milrinone was
initially given a weaning trial , but his mixed venous oxygen
saturations dropped to the high 40s and low 50s and the milrinone
was restarted. The Neosynephrine was the first drip to be
discontinued and the patient remained on milrinone and
epinephrine. Both of these were slowly weaned , the epinephrine
coming off first and the milrinone coming off two days prior to
transfer out of the ICU. He was in rapid atrial fibrillation and
was initially loaded with digoxin , which did improve the rate
transiently. He continued to have marginal mixed venous oxygen
saturation and poor cardiac performance as assessed by cardiac
output and cardiac index. Postoperatively , he had an intraaortic
balloon pump. The intraaortic balloon pump remained in until
postoperative day# 9 when it was discontinued. Slowly the drips
were weaned. He was started on an afterload reducing agent ,
first a drip of sodium nitroprusside , after he had had a trial of
esmolol. The esmolol did improve his rates slightly but did not
significantly improve his cardiac output or his mixed venous
oxygen saturation. He did seem to have improvement with the
afterload reducing agent of sodium nitroprusside. His rapid
atrial fibrillation remained refractory to medical treatment. He
was given trial of ibutilide , which did not significantly change
his rate or convert him into sinus rhythm. He was loaded with
amiodarone in spite of his prior history of pulmonary and hepatic
toxicity with plan to use a short course of amiodarone to improve
the rate. His rate did improve. He remained in atrial
fibrillation and did not convert to sinus. On postoperative day
8 , he was taken to the operating room and cardioverted
successfully to sinus rhythm. Transesophageal echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 30% and no clots in the atrial
ventricles. He remained in a sinus rhythm for approximately
three days until postoperative day 11 when he switched back into
atrial fibrillation that was refractory to ibutilide. Attempted
cardioversion was done the following day , which failed , and he
remained in atrial fibrillation on transfer to the floor. His
rate was better controlled in the 80s to 90s and he was on a
regimen of digoxin , afterload-reducing agent Captopril 25 mg q.6
h. and low-dose Lopressor 6.25 mg q.i.d. His pulmonary artery
catheter was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor , and on
transfer to the floor , his mixed venous oxygen saturation was
improved in the high 50s to low 60s.
3. Pulmonary: Initially , the patient required BIPAP while in
the Intensive Care Unit. He needed an aggressive diuresis to
improve his pulmonary status but transfer to the floor , he was
down to 3 L nasal cannula and he was able to ambulate and get out
of bed.
4. GI: The patient was initially started on clear liquids and
was taking very minimal p.o.'s because he had a significant BIPAP
requirement. As the BIPAP was weaned , his diet was advanced and
he was tolerating a regular diet on transfer to floor. He did
have several episodes of diarrhea. Fecal leukocytes and
Clostridium difficile were sent and were negative and the
diarrhea was resolving on transfer to the floor.
5. GU: The patient was aggressively diuresed with a Lasix drip
and with Diuril boluses. His creatinine tolerated the
aggressively diuresis. His sodium remained low in the 130s and
he was transitioned off the Lasix drip to p.o. Lasix and
continued to be negative on transfer to the floor.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes and
hypothyroidism. He was maintained on dose of Synthroid initially
IV. Then , that was transitioned to p.o. when he was tolerating
p.o.'s. He was on subcutaneous insulin and his sugars were well
controlled. Initially , he was on Portland protocol and was then
transitioned to subcutaneous insulin.
7. Heme: The patient was anticoagulated with heparin initially
for the intraaortic balloon pump and atrial fibrillation. He did
have a marked drop in his platelets and was positive for
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. He was started on argatroban
and bridged to Coumadin. On transfer to the floor , he remains on
argatroban with a goal PTT of 50 to 70 and he is getting Coumadin
with goal INR 2 to 3.
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had an elevated while blood
cell count throughout the course of his ICU hospital stay. He
had the intraaortic balloon pump in place for nine days. He was
seen by ID and his only positive blood culture was a
coag-negative staph that was believe to be a contaminant. He was
on vancomycin for many days that was not discontinued. He does
have a history of right knee gout , which did flare while he was
in the Intensive Care Unit and part of his elevated blood cell
count was attributed to that. He was started on colchicine and
Allopurinol.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: On transfer to the floor , the patient was
on following medications:
1. Captopril 25 mg p.o. q.6 h.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.i.d.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
4. Lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.
6. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
7. Clonazepam 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. daily.
9. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Regular insulin sliding scale.
11. Synthroid 50 mcg p.o. daily.
12. Magnesium and potassium scales.
13. Ambien 5 mg p.o. at bedtime.
14. Nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.
15. Lantus 12 units subcutaneously at bedtime.
16. Darbepoetin alfa 40 mcg subcutaneous.
17. NovoLog sliding scale and NovoLog four units subcutaneously
with lunch and six units with dinner.
DISPOSITION: He was transferred to the floor in stable
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: He will need continued evaluation with physical and
occupational therapy.
