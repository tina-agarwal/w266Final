Discharge Date: 10/6/2005
ATTENDING: KELLEY , IRWIN M.D.
SERVICE: Orthopedic Service.
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Infected left total hip replacement.
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Removal of infected cemented left total hip
replacement with debridement of the hip and placement of
antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers on 10/30/05 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Beish is a 46-year-old female
with multiple medical problems who initially sustained a left hip
intertrochanteric fracture in March of 2004 and underwent an
ORIF with a DHS on 2/22/04 . The screw ultimately cut off and
she underwent removal of hardware on 7/14/04 with insertion of a
hemiarthroplasty with antibiotic beads. Her culture grew
coag-negative staph at that time and she was treated with six
weeks of IV antibiotics. After multiple hip aspirations to
confirm that the joint was no longer infected , she underwent a
left total hip replacement on 11/28/04 by Dr. Sweis . She ended
up being hospitalized in Gassonvenchand Pendinea Port from 8/4/05 to 3/29/05
with an E. coli bacteremia of unclear etiology , although it was
felt likely secondary to pyelonephritis. During that
hospitalization , she developed neck pain and was found to have
MRSA osteomyelitis at C6-C7. She underwent a C6-C7 I&amp;D infusion
on 7/28/05 . She ultimately completed 16 weeks of IV vancomycin
for her MRSA spinal infection and at the completion of the
vancomycin therapy in February of 2005 , was started on minocycline
with a plan for a six-month treatment. She ultimately presented
to Dr. Amoako 's office on 4/25/05 with increasing left
groin/hip/lateral thigh pain over several months duration. Two
left hip aspirates in November , both grew MRSA , and as such , she
was scheduled for an explant of her left total hip replacement
with insertion of an antibiotic spacer on 10/30/05 .

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single and lives alone in Utah She quit smoking tobacco 25 years ago and does not drink
alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Remarkable for an obese
female , ambulates with a walker and an antalgic gait on the left.
She had mild tenderness with palpation in her mid cervical
spine. She had some mild distal left upper extremity and
proximal left lower extremity weakness. Gentle range of motion
of her left hip caused pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 10/12/05 for
initiation of IV antibiotic therapy at the request of the
Infectious Disease Service under the direction of Dr. Willy H Kirkey . Prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy , she had
blood cultures drawn , which ultimately showed no growth. Given
her neck pain and slight weakness , she also had an MRI of her
cervical spine performed , which showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis. Preoperatively , she was seen by both the
Infectious Disease Consult Service as well as the Medical Consult
Service. She was placed on a low-dose beta-blocker at the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service. On the morning of
hospital day 2 , the beta-blocker was then discontinued under the
recommendation of the Medical Consult Service , as it was felt to
likely add little benefit. She did receive one dose of Coumadin
the night before surgery in preparation for DVT prophylaxis. She
was ultimately taken to the operating room on hospital day 2
where she underwent removal of her left total hip replacement
with irrigation , debridement and placement of an antibiotic
spacer. Estimated blood loss was 2.5 L. She received six units
of packed red blood cells , 9 L of crystalloid and 1 L of albumin.
Intraoperatively , gross pus was found. Intraoperative cultures
were sent , which ultimately grew MRSA. The patient received
perioperative stress dose hydrocortisone. Postoperatively , she
was taken to the surgical intensive care unit and intubated. Her
postoperative hematocrit was 29.2. The morning of postoperative
day 1 , the patient remained intubated but was able to open her
eyes and follow commands. She was neurovascularly intact in the
left lower extremity. She was treated with Lovenox only
initially given that she did not initially have an NG tube so
that p.o. medications including Coumadin could be administered.
She was continued on the vancomycin. The patient remained
intubated throughout the remainder of postoperative day 1 and
into the morning of postoperative day 2. Her hematocrit had
drifted down to 22.4 on postoperative day #1 for which she was
transfused two units with her hematocrit up to 26.2. She
continued to remain hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly
intact. An NG tube had been placed on postoperative day 1 , so
that p.o. medications including her Mestinon could be given for
her myasthenia gravis. She was ultimately extubated mid morning
on postoperative day 2. Her dressing was changed at that time
and the incision was clean and intact without any erythema. The
patient remained in the surgical ICU until postoperative day 3 ,
mainly with continued pain issues. She had been on a fentanyl
drip and was transitioned over to Dilaudid PCA. She was started
on clear diet on postoperative day 3 and transitioned over to
regular insulin sliding scale from the insulin drip that she had
been on to the early a.m. hours of postoperative day 3. Her
hematocrit remained stable in the high 20s. Her right IJ central
line was changed out over a wire under sterile technique in the
ICU on postoperative day 3 prior to transfer to the floor. She
was transferred to the floor in stable condition lat in the day
on postoperative day 3. She was taking p.o.'s at that time and
her home medications were restarted including her home
prednisone. Postoperative day 4 , pain continued to be her main
issue and she was seen by the Chronic Pain Service for
recommendations on transitioning her off of the high-dose
Dilaudid PCA. PCA was discontinued and she was started on p.r.n.
oxycodone in addition to her home a fentanyl patch and OxyContin.
Physical Therapy worked with the patient throughout her hospital
stay and were able to first sit her up on the edge of the bed on
postoperative day 4. She continued to remain afebrile ,
hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization. Her hematocrit was stable in
the high 20s. She had a PICC line placed on postoperative day 5
for administration of her long-term IV vancomycin. The Pain
Service continued to see the patient and titrate her pain
medications with gradually improving effect. The Foley was
discontinued the morning of postoperative day 6 , as the patient
began to be able to move around a little more easily. By
postoperative day 7 , she was more comfortable , was tolerating a
regular diet and voiding q. shift without a Foley. She was
afebrile , hemodynamically stable and neurovascularly intact. She
was continued on both Coumadin and Lovenox given that her INR was
still not therapeutic. She should continue on the Coumadin with
a Lovenox bridge until the INR is therapeutic. The patient was
cleared for transfer to rehab on postoperative day 7 by the
Orthopedic Infectious Disease and Physical Therapy services. She
was accepted for transfer to the Biger Community Hospital in Ee ,
