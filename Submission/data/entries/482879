HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 48 year old gentleman
with cardiac risk factors including
diabetes; adult onset , hypertension , positive family history ,
dyslipidemia , and also with a distant tobacco use history and with
severe obesity. The patient has a long history of coronary artery
disease starting in 1989. The patient presented with angina and
ruled out for a myocardial infarction at that time. In 1991 he had
unstable angina. A catheterization revealed 100% LAD lesion
proximally , 60% D-1 , 70% distal left circumflex , and normal right
coronary artery. PTCA to the LAD was performed with 30% residual
lesion. In 1992 the patient had two myocardial infarctions. In
February of 1992 a re-catheterization showed an additional lesion of
an OM-2 with 60% complex lesion with a mid LAD total occlusion with
right-to-left collaterals and diffuse PDA disease. In February of
1992 a repeat catheterization was performed for continued unstable
angina and the patient had an 80% left circumflex lesion , a 70%
OM-2 , 100% proximal LAD , 70% distal left circumflex , 70% OM-2.
Over this time period between 1991 and 1992 , the patient had a
total of four myocardial infarctions including a large anterior
wall myocardial infarction. The patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting in February of 1992 which was complicated by
ventricular fibrillation arrest in the postoperative Intensive Care
Unit. The patient received a LIMA to the LAD , SVG to the OM-1 and
an SVG to the OM-2. The patient had a repeat catheterization in
February of 1994 for unstable angina which showed diffuse native
disease: 100% LAD with right-to-left collaterals , 70% distal left
circumflex , 100% proximal OM-1 , 100% OM-2 , 50% mid right coronary
artery. The grafts were patent. Since that time the patient has
had minimal chest pain. The patient was seen in the clinic most
recently in March of 1997 for exertional chest pain. The patient
did well with an increase in his Atenolol dose.
On the day of admission today , for this admission , the patient
experienced chest burning at rest while watching TV with no
emotional or exertional stress. The pain lasted 40 minutes ,
radiating to the jaw with an intensity of 8 out of 10. The patient
took a shower without relief , took five sublingual Nitroglycerin
tablets without relief. The patient presented to the Emergency Ward
where his pain was relieved in the Waiting Room. The patient had
no nausea or vomiting , diaphoresis or shortness of breath. The
patient has had no increasing dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea or PND
recently; however the patient is not physically active. Of note ,
an echocardiogram in 1993 showed an ejection fraction of 40% with
apical akinesis and septal hypokinesis.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is an obese , pleasant male in
no distress. Vital signs: Temperature
97.6 , pulse 88 , blood pressure 127/64 , respirations 18 , oxygen
saturation was 95% on room air. JVP was eight centimeters. There
was a normal S1 and S2. There was a positive S4 , no S3. There was
a 1/6 holosystolic murmur with no radiation. Left basilar crackles
were noted. There was a large abdomen with good peripheral pulses.
LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , BUN 18 , creatinine
0.8 , CK 370 , MB 9.1 , troponin 0.21. White blood
cell count 13 , 000 , hematocrit 45.7 , platelet count 253 , 000 , INR
2.4 , PTT 37.6. The patient's chest x-ray was of poor quality , with
no congestive heart failure and mild cardiomegaly , and bibasilar
atelectasis. The patient's EKG had a normal sinus rhythm with a
rate of 75 , Q waves in III and aVF , V1 and V2. ST elevations in
III and aVF of one millimeter , ST depressions and T wave inversions
in I and L , but no changes when compared to the patient's baseline
EKG.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial
infarction , and given his extensive history of
previous coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass
grafting , it was felt most likely that the patient is now
developing an occlusion of his grafted vessels versus occlusion of
his right coronary system. The patient's peak CK was 370 with
positive MB. The patient was continued on aspirin , Lopressor ,
Captopril , Simvastatin , and IV heparin , and Nitropaste sliding
scale. The next morning the patient was taken to the
Catheterization Lab where the previous native disease was noted ,
but additional disease of the RCA with serial mid 90% lesions ,
which were stented , a PDA of serial 70 and 90% lesions were
dilated. The patient was placed on Ticlid. The patient
experienced no chest pain after the procedure and EKGs had shown no
changes after the procedure. A submax Bruce protocol exercise
treadmill test was negative prior to discharge.
ENDOCRINE: The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes and his
Metformin was held before the catheterization
procedure , and the patient was continued on insulin sliding scale
and his Glyburide without complications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q
day. 2 ) Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q day. 3 )
Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4 ) Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets
q.5 minutes x three; one tablet p.r.n. chest pain. 5 ) Simvastatin
20 mg p.o. q.h.s. 6 ) Ticlid 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 14 days. 7 )
Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q day. 8 ) Lisinopril 500 mg p.o. q day. 9 )
Coumadin 12.5 mg p.o. q day.
The patient is to return to work in three weeks.
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY WITH STENT
PLACEMENT.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: The patient's condition on discharge was
stable.
DISCHARGE DIET: The patient's discharge diet was a low-cholesterol
low-fat diet , ADA 1800 calorie diet.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS: The patient will follow-up with his primary
cardiologist , Dr. Denzel , and internist , Dr.
Eddie Lantzy .
