SERVICE: GENERAL MEDICINE TEAM Fontpor Wood Vi
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
2. REACTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE.
3. HYPERTENSION.
4. MORBID OBESITY.
BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 60-year-old African-American
female with a recent , eleven-day hospitalization at
the Brentcal Hospital for a congestive heart failure
flare. The patient presents now with two days of progressively
worsening shortness of breath at rehabilitation. The patient
presented initially with chest pain and CHF , and was ruled out for
a myocardial infarction , in early March . An echocardiogram then
revealed mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction and abnormal
septal motion , with septal apical hypokinesis and minimal mitral
regurgitation. An exercise treadmill test at that time was without
ischemia , though her target heart rate was not achieved. During
the hospitalization at that time , the patient was slowly diuresed
and then discharged to rehabilitation. At rehabilitation , she has
been chest-pain-free , but she has had increasing shortness of
breath and wheezing. In the emergency department , she was found to
be in congestive heart failure by chest x-ray. The oxygen
saturations were 93% on 2 liters. She was given albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers and IV Solu-Medrol , and was also given a dose
of 120 mg of IV Lasix.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Please see the Problem List.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient has had the following
surgeries: ( 1 ) A cholecystectomy; ( 2 ) Two
Caesarean sections.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Ventolin two puffs p.o. q.i.d. ,
Azmacort four puffs b.i.d. , Rhinocort
two puffs b.i.d. , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol
25 mg p.o. q.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.d. ,
Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Cozaar 75 mg
p.o. q.d. , Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. ,
and nitroglycerin sublingually p.r.n.
LISTED ALLERGIES: Lisinopril gives her a cough.
SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol use and no IV drug abuse.
The patient works in the Chand O Rock , Virginia 48456 at
the Ham Greatsilove Hospital .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the vital signs include the
following: the temperature is 98.0 degrees
F. , the pulse 87 , the blood pressure 180/110 , and the respirations
24. The oxygen saturation is 92% on 2 liters. In general , the
patient is a morbidly obese female in mild to moderate distress.
The neck is supple , without bruits; the jugular venous pressure
cannot be assessed secondary to the patient's body habitus. The
cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with an
S1 , an S2 , and an S3 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the
right upper sternal border and a 2/6 murmur at the left upper
sternal border. Examination of the lungs is significant for rales
bilaterally in one-third of the lung fields. She also has
inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory
phase. The abdomen is soft , non-tender , and non-distended , with no
masses. The extremities show 2+ pitting edema in both lower
extremities and the pulses are 2+ in the dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial arteries. On neurological examination , the
patient is alert and oriented times four. The neurologic
examination is otherwise non-focal.
DATA BASE: The admission chest x-ray showed moderate congestive
heart failure with moderate pulmonary edema but no
acute infiltrate. The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a
rate of 60 , a normal axis , and no ST-T wave changes when compared
to prior EKGs from March 2000. The admission laboratory studies
were as follows. The sodium was 140 , the potassium 4.0 , the
chloride 99 , the CO2 39 , the BUN 23 , the creatinine 0.9 , the
glucose 78 , the CK 114 , the troponin 0.00. The white count was
8 , 200 , the hematocrit 44 , and the platelets 315 , 000. The PT was
11.8 , the PTT 23.1. The cholesterol level was 206.
HOSPITAL COURSE: By problems:
1. CARDIOVASCULAR. The patient was re-admitted to the Wakeview Hosp Of Valley with worsening congestive heart failure on a dose
of Lasix of 40 mg p.o. q.d. She received 120 mg IV Lasix in the
emergency department and her diuresis was continued with aggressive
intravenous Lasix until two days prior to discharge , when she was
switched to p.o. Lasix. She was started initially on 120 mg of IV
Lasix once a day , which resulted in a diuresis of 1-2 liters every
twenty-four-hour period. The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial enzymes and EKGs. The decision had been made
during the last hospitalization to manage her coronary artery
disease medically. The patient did not desire cardiac
catheterization at this point. She was eventually switched to oral
Lasix at a dose of 60 mg by mouth twice a day.
2. RESPIRATORY. The patient was admitted to the hospital for
congestive heart failure but also had evidence of reactive airway
disease on clinical examination. She had profound inspiratory and
expiratory wheezes and shortness of breath. Due to the history of
reactive airway disease , the patient was started on intravenous
Solu-Medrol , albuterol , Atrovent , and Serevent. She was given
supplemental O2 to maintain her oxygen saturations greater than
93%. She was continued on her IV steroids throughout the
hospitalization , and these were eventually switched to p.o.
prednisone near the end of the hospitalization and were to be
tapered on an outpatient basis. Her shortness of breath resolved
by the time of discharge.
3. FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES. Due to the aggressive diuresis , the
patient developed a contraction alkalosis during the course of
hospitalization. Her bicarbonate rose to a level of 43 , with a BUN
of 34. At this time , the diuresis was withdrawn slightly and the
patient's electrolytes normalized.
