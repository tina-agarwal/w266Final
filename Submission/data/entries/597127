Discharge Date: 8/2/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: UNSTABLE ANGINA.
STATUS POST MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was a 45 year old
gentleman with a history of a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in 23 of April He was also recently
involved in a motor vehicle accident , and has had left pressure
since the accident. His cardiac history began in 25 of June , when he
suffered a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. A cardiac
catheterization at that time revealed a 90% proximal left anterior
descending lesion with anterolateral akinesis , which was treated
with angioplasty. He had a limited stress test on 4 of June , which
was limited by symptoms of chest pressure. The electrocardiogram
and thallium done at that time were both unrevealing. The patient
was involved in a motor vehicle accident in August , and then again
in March , 1991. He suffered multiple contusions , but no fractures.
Subsequent to the accidents , however , he described having left
flank and left side pain , which was exacerbated by movement and was
associated with the development of his left substernal chest
pressure. Nitroglycerin did seem to provide him some relief. The
patient was seen recently at Laclare's Bouldwalt in Rockoxsiford Au for chest
discomfort , and electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes did not show
any evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient has continued
to complain of chest discomfort over the past month , but all
electrocardiograms have been negative. An exercise tolerance test
was performed at Tygib Haysbonne Valley Hospital , which was positive for
chest discomfort and for ST depressions in the inferolateral leads.
Thallium examination was not performed because of infiltration of
the intravenous access. He was transferred from Jacklip on 25 of October , for further work-up and possible cardiac
catheterization.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission , the patient was a well
nourished , well appearing young black male.
His blood pressure was 130/80 , pulse 55 , respiratory rate 12. Lungs
were clear. Cardiac examination revealed S1 , S2 , with an S4
present , the jugular venous pressure was 5. The patient had 2+
carotid upstrokes without bruits. The abdomen was soft , good bowel
sounds , with left-sided tenderness and left flank tenderness to
palpation. Extremities showed no edema and good distal pulses.
Neurologic examination showed cranial nerves intact , motor
examination showed some decreased power on the left , but this was
thought secondary to pain. Sensory examination was normal , and his
plantar reflexes were downgoing.
LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission , potassium was 4.6 ,
creatinine 1.3 , ALT 155 , AST 80 , LDH 228 ,
creatinine kinase 79 , cholesterol 212 , triglyceride 316 , white
blood count 6.1 , hematocrit 39 , prothrombin time 13.5 , partial
thromboplastin time 89.4. Admission chest x-ray showed no
abnormalities. Admission electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 56 beats per minute with some inverted T-waves in leads
II , III , F , and V2 through V4. The inverted T-wave in lead II
appeared to be new from a transfer electrocardiogram.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on 25 of October , and was seen
by the Dental Service for his atypical pain
radiating to the neck. His cardiac risk factors included a
positive family history and a smoking history of less than 1 pack
per day. He had no history of diabetes or previous hypertension.
The patient continued to have chest pain , which responded only to
morphine. He underwent cardiac catheterization on 20 of July , which
revealed a right dominant circulation , kinking of the proximal left
anterior descending artery with a 70% stenosis. The patient
tolerated the cardiac catheterization well without hematoma or
bruit in the right groin. The patient continued to have episodes
of chest pain with 5/10 left-sided sternal chest pain without clear
electrocardiogram changes from the admission electrocardiogram. He
underwent an exercise tolerance test which showed he had 4/10 chest
pain prior to beginning the exercise tolerance test , but then got
worsening chest pain during the test after 8 minutes and 15
seconds , peak heart rate 160 , blood pressure 166/40. He did
develop 1 millimeter of downsloping ST depressions in the lateral
leads , and a pseudonormalization of the T-waves. The results were
discussed with the patient and the options were discussed , that is
medical management versus a repeat angioplasty or possible surgery.
The patient preferred medical management and wanted to be at home
to see if increased medical management would stabilize his chest
pain. The patient was discharged on 8 of June
DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. He was to have
close FOLLOW-UP and management of his cardiac disease
with the Cardiology Group. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included
Motrin 600 milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , diltiazem 90
milligrams by mouth 3 times a day , Lopressor 50 milligrams by mouth
twice a day , Ecotrin 1 tablet by mouth per day , Pepcid 20
milligrams by mouth twice a day , Isordil 40 milligrams by mouth 3
times a day , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as
needed for pain , and Halcion 0.25 milligrams by mouth at hour of
sleep. The patient had a FOLLOW-UP appointment with Dr. Capetl in
