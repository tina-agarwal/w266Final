ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs: Temperature 96.5 , pulse 85 , blood pressure 98/36 ,
respiratory rate 22 , oxygen saturation 99% on 2 liters.
Generally , the patient is obese with short of breath , alert and
oriented x3. Cardiovascular exam: Remarkable for an irregular ,
irregular rhythm with distant heart sounds , no murmurs , rubs or
gallops. Normal S1 and S2 , his JVP was noted to be at the jaw.
Lungs: Remarkable for diffuse wheezes. Abdomen: Obese ,
nontender , without masses. Extremities: He had bilateral
pitting edema , left lower extremity was noted to be erythematous
to the inguinal crease with weeping. He was neurologically
nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABS:
Remarkable for sodium of 129 , potassium 5.7 , creatinine of 1.5 up
from his baseline 0.9-1.3 , BUN of 30. Magnesium 1.6 , INR 2.8%.
First set of cardiac enzymes were negative with a BNP of 127.
WBC is 28.5 , hematocrit 34.7 , platelets of 189 , baseline
hematocrit is usually in the high 20s. Differential: Notable
for 97 neutrophils and 20 bands.
EKG remarkable for atrial fibrillation with a rate of 82 , Q-waves
in V1 and V2 without ST changes , low voltage. His T-wave was
upright in V2 and V3 which is changed from his prior EKG in
7/26 .  Chest x-ray notable for pericardial effusion which
shows increase in size and question of fluid at the bilateral
bases.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Mr. Inskeep is a 74-year-old man with severe venous stasis , CHF ,
atrial fibrillation requiring Coumadin , COPD , severe left lower
extremity cellulitis status post surgical debridement who
presents with shortness of breath and recurrent left lower
extremity cellulitis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient had some pseudonormalization in
V2 , V3. He was ruled out for MI. He was continued on his
aspirin and Zocor. His CK was noted to be increasing , but he was
clinically unchanged , and there was low suspicion for necrotizing
fasciitis or myositis. He was not felt to be cardiac in origin.
The patient has right heart failure. He was overloaded on exam.
His JVP was difficult to assess given his history of tricuspid
regurgitation. He did have enlarged heart on his chest x-ray and
an echo on 5/15/06 showed a precordial fat-pad without effusion.
His EF was unchanged. His PA pressure was 35+ RA. His IVC was
nonpulsatile suggesting increased RA pressures. He responded to
Lasix 80 mg IV. He was not diuresed on this admission. He was
continued on his home dose of Lasix at 80 mg p.o. twice daily.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has no need for rate
control at this time. Coumadin was held for GI bleeding that the
patient developed on 4/2/06 .  He had an episode of hematemesis
in the setting of an INR of 3 which was thought to be a
Mallory-Weiss tear from coughing. His hematocrit stabilized at
27. His fibrinogen D-dimer were normal. He was made n.p.o. ,
received four units of FFP and 2 units of packed red cells. An
NG tube was placed which has been since removed. The GI Service
recommended an IV proton pump inhibitor. On 5/15/06 , his diet
was advanced. He was tolerating that well and his hematocrits
were stable at this point.
3. Respiratory: The patient had wheeziness on exam when he was
admitted. He received DuoNebs q.6h. and on exam , his wheeziness
resolved.
4. ID: The patient has recurrent cellulitis secondary to venous
stasis. Cultures from the debridement in 7/26 were negative.
Blood cultures drawn p.r.n. 3/19/06 were positive for
acinetobacter diphtheroids. Wound cultures of the left leg
showed 2+ acinetobacter , beta streptococcus group G
corynebacterium. From the right leg , he grew 2+ MRSA ,
corynebacterium and beta strep. The organisms were sensitive to
levofloxacin , his staph aureus MRSA. Blood culture 4/2/06 is
no growth to date at the time of this dictation. Stool on
4/2/06 was positive for C. diff and urine culture 5/15/06
showed Gram-negative rods. Surgical Service recommended
antibiotic treatment. The patient was started on vancomycin
( started 3/19/06 ) , levofloxacin ( started 3/19/06 ) , aztreonam
was added on 5/15/06 for Acinetobacter in his blood. He
was given gentamicin x1 on 4/2/06 in the setting of
hypotension. He will continue vancomycin and levofloxacin for
four weeks and will stop on 7/0/06 .  He will continue Flagyl
for six weeks ( started 2/2/06 to stop on 11/11/07 for his C.
diff ). The wound culture from his bilateral lower extremities is
polymicrobial. If the erythema spread , he becomes febrile , or his
legs become more tender , please have a low threshold for
noncontrast CT and surgical consultation. Lower extremity
Dopplers were negative for DVT but there is incomplete
visualization at all of his left leg veins.
5. Renal: The patient had acute on chronic renal failure ,
( baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1 ) , hyponatremia , hyperkalemia on
admission. There was some question of adrenal insufficiency but
he had a normal random cortisol. His fractional excretion of
urea was 26% and he has since been volume resuscitated. His
creatinine responded accordingly.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient has been on Coumadin that was held
in the setting of GI bleed. We have held his Lovenox as well.
He is on an oral proton pump inhibitor.
CODE STATUS:
The patient is DNR/DNI. Pressors are okay. Healthcare proxy is
Hal Feucht who is his sister 199-347-1999.
