PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. RULE OUT MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 2. UNSTABLE ANGINA
3. HYPERTENSION
4. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA
5. STATUS POST CORONARY ARTERY
BYPASS GRAFT
PROCEDURES: CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION AND PTCA
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old male
status post coronary artery bypass
graft in 1988 who presents with unstable angina. In 2/19 , he had
an episode of substernal chest pain and an EKG done was positive.
Catheterization revealed 95% mid LAD , 50% diagonal LAD , 80% D1 , 80%
left circ , 80% OM1 , OM2 , and diffuse RCA. Attempted PTCA was
complicated by substernal chest pain and a CK peaked to 1920. He
required an intra-aortic balloon pump and emergent coronary artery
bypass graft times three. The coronary artery bypass graft
included SVG to LAG , SVG to OM1 , SVG to OM2. In 1990 , he underwent
another exercise test with one millimeter ST depression thought
secondary to fatigue. In 0/6 , he had further substernal chest
pain and shortness of breath and another positive ETT. He ruled
out for myocardial infarction at that time. Catheterization
revealed SPT to LAD patent , SPT to OM1 patent , SPT to OM2 patent.
Leading LAD , OM1 , OM2 , and OM3 100% acquitted. RC s OM3 80% , 80% ,
80% lesions were PTCA'd and reduced to 20% , 20% , and 30% serial
lesions.
In March of 1994 , an exercise tolerance test was predictive of
ischemia ( exercise 9 minutes on standard Bruce with typical
substernal chest pain ). His heart rate was 131 , blood pressure
230/90 , 1 millimeter ST depression. In July of 1994 , he was
admitted with recurrent substernal chest pain which was relieved
with sublingual Nitroglycerin. He ruled out for myocardial
infarction. A catheterization at that time revealed restenosis of
proximal RCA 90% lesion. He underwent successful PTCA of RCA
lesion. Other grafts were patent. On August , 1994 , he
exercised on standard Bruce protocol six minutes and 20 seconds
with chest pain five out of ten. He had two depressions
infralaterally and was seen at CIMMC with question of restenosis. It
was felt they should increase his Diltiazem. He was intolerant of a
beta blocker. He now presents with one week of additional
substernal chest pain. On the night prior to admission , he had
substernal chest pain at rest times two which were immediately
relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His pat medical history is significant for a
duodenal ulcer ( upper GI bleed , 1988 ) , ankylosing spondylitis ,
adult onset diabetes mellitus , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ,
hyperglyceremia , hypertension. SOCIAL HISTORY: Tobacco - he quit
in 1988 - with 80 pack year history. No alcohol use. FAMILY
HISTORY: His brother is status post coronary artery bypass graft.
His other brother died at age 60 of myocardial infarction. He has
a brother with CEA. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a letter carrier. He
is married and four children , two at home who are healthy.
MEDICATIONS: His medications on admission are Tagamet , Diltiazem
CD 240 mg p.o. qd , ECSA q.o.d. , Cholespol 5 grams b.i.d. , and Axid.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient had a temperature of 97.2 ,
pulse 54 and regular , respirations 20 ,
blood pressure 140/60 , O2 saturation on 2 liters 99%. HEENT - His
pupils are equal , round , and reactive to light. Oropharynx was
clear. His carotids were two plus bilaterally. He had no
lymphadenopathy. His thyroid was nonpalpable. Jugular venous
pressure approximately 8 centimeters. He had fine rales
bilaterally at bases of his lungs. He had a regular rate and
rhythm. S-1 and S-2 are normal. There was no S-3 , no S-4 , and no
murmurs. PMI non-displaced. Mediastinum - He had an old scar.
Abdomen - He has no scars. His abdomen is soft and non-tender and
no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: He has femoral scars
bilaterally , 2 plus pulses , no bruits. His rectal was guaiac
negative per Emergency Room. Neurological - His reflexes are two
plus upper extremities , one plus lower extremities , toes downgoing.
Cranial nerves II-XII in tact. Motor sensory grossly intact. He
was alert and oriented times three. LABORATORY DATA: His
hematocrit was 47.4 , white cont 7.2 , platelets 241 , sodium 143 ,
potassium 4.2 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 213 , cholesterol
233 , triglycerides 278 , calcium 9.7 , albumen 4.4. All other labs
were within normal limits.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for
evaluation of unstable angina with a
markedly positive exercise tolerance test at RKO for cardiac
catheterization. He ruled out for myocardial infarction with CPKs
of 158 , 143 , 132. EKGs were without any significant change and he
had no further episodes of chest burning or discomfort on the day
following admission. DIET: He was continued on his his
medications prior to admission and was also started on an ADA diet
given his diabetes. On 3/10/94 , the patient had an episode of
chest pain which required sublingual Nitroglycerin and IV Heparin
for resolution. He described this as chest pressure radiating
bilaterally to his neck and complained of gas like sensations.
EKGs revealed ST change in 1 and inverted T in AVL and he was
started on IV Heparin. He was also given Serax. IV TNG was
started and titrated to obtain a blood pressure greater than 100.
His symptoms resolved. An EKG following a resolution of symptoms
showed resolution of EKG changes. Duration of chest pain was
approximately 40 minutes. A cardiac catheterization on 9/22/94
showed preliminary results of 80% stenosis in mid RCA which was
successfully dilated to 20% with PTCA , an occluded LAD , an occluded
OMB1 and OMB2 and 50% left circ. , patent SVG to LAD , patent SVG to
OMB2 , occluded SBG to OMB. His wedge was 13 , RA 9 , RV 28/10 , PA
28/14 , arterial pressure 110/70. He remained comfortable
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization status PTCA and RCA
without further episodes of chest pain or pressure. His
medications were increased for better blood pressure control.
DISPOSITION: MEDICATIONS: He was discharged on 9/27/94 to
follow-up with Dr. Wauer at TGH on
November Medications at the time of discharge were EPSA 325
mg p.o. q.o.d. , Diltiazem CD 300 mg p.o. qd , Tagamet 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , Colestipol 5 grams p.o. b.i.d. , Sublingual Nitroglycerin
1/150 q 5 minutes x 3 prn chest pain.
