HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Almon is a 51 year old gentleman
with history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus and unstable angina. The patient was doing yard
work in the afternoon when he experienced an episode of nausea and
vomiting along with chest discomfort. The patient presented to his
primary care physician who noted EKG changes with ST depressions in
V3 to V6 and was sent to the emergency room which was noted to have
an old T wave inversion in lead 3 which was now upright and ST
depressions that were normalizing. CKs at that time were 974 , MB
24.3 , Troponin level was 1.77. The patient received aspirin 5 mg
of intravenous Lopressor , Heparin drip and Adenosine MIBI which was
performed back in May of 1999 revealed inferior ischemia. The
patient underwent cardiac catheterization on November , 2001 which
revealed the following: Right dominant system , no significant left
main lesions identified , left anterior descending coronary artery
with a discreet mid 65% lesion , distal 99% lesion and first
diagonal coronary artery with a proximal discrete 70% lesion , left
circumflex coronary artery with a distal after the second obtuse
marginal discrete 60% lesion , supplying the second obtuse marginal.
First marginal coronary artery had an ostial discrete 90% lesion
and a second obtuse marginal had an ostial discrete 100% lesion.
Right coronary artery had a mid discrete 95% lesion supplying the
right posterior descending coronary artery. He was also noted to
have collateral flow from left anterior descending artery to the
right posterior descending artery. The patient underwent
echocardiogram on November , 2001 which revealed the following: 1.
There was mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced
with an estimated ejection fraction of 45%. There is severe
hypokinesis of the basal and mid segments of the inferior wall and
inferior septum. In addition , there is severe hypokinesis of the
posterior wall , apex and distal anterior wall. THis is suggestive
of multiple coronary artery disease. 2. The right ventricle
appears normal in size and systolic function. 3. The mitral valve
appears mildly thickened. The anterior mitral leaflet is mildly
elongated and there might be mild systolic prolapse of the anterior
leaflet. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. 4. The aortic valve
is trileaflet and appears mildly thickened. There is no aortic
stenosis or regurgitation. 5. The tricuspid valve appears
structurally normal. No significant tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. 6. There is no pericardial effusion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY/ PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for
insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , peripheral
vascular disease.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS: On admission are Lisinopril 10 mg once a day , Zocor
40 mg once a day , vitamin E , enteric coated aspirin
325 mg every other day , NPH Humulin insulin 40 units in the morning
and 10 in the evening , regular insulin 6 units twice a day and
multivitamin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Noncontributory.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Bingamon was rushed to the operating room on
March , 2001 where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3 with a left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the
intermediate coronary artery. The patient did well
intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident , was brought up
to the intensive care unit in normal sinus rhythm and in stable
condition. Postoperatively , Mr. Bown did very well. He was
extubated on postoperative day number one and transferred to the
step down unit. He had an unremarkable postoperative course until
the night prior to discharge when he was noted to have serous
drainage from the inferior aspect of his sternal incision. On
physical examination , he was noted to have no sternal click and his
white count did go from 9.2 on May to 11.26 on February . The
patient had a T.max of 99. We did start him on Keflex 500 mg four
times a day for 10 days and he will have a follow-up white blood
cell count on November , 2001 which shall be called into his primary
care physician. Mr. Piotrowski other labs for February , 2001 are as
follows: Glucose 291 , BUN 20 , creatinine of 0.9 , sodium 136 ,
potassium 5 , chloride of 97 , CO2 of 31 , magnesium of 1.5. WBC was
11.26 , hemoglobin 9.2 , hematocrit 28.2 , platelets 438. PT was
12.7 , PT/INR of 1.1.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: For Mr. Eide are as follows: Enteric
coated aspirin 325 mg once a day , ibuprofen
200 to 800 mg every 4 to 6 h p.r.n. pain , NPH Humulin insulin 44
units in the morning , 14 units in the evening , regular insulin 6
units twice a day , Niferex 150 mg twice a day , potassium chloride
20 mEq once a day , Zocor 40 mg once in the evening , Atenolol 50 mg
once a day , Lisinopril 10 mg once a day , Keflex 500 mg four times a
day for 10 days for his superficial sternal wound infection and
torsemide 60 mg twice a day.
