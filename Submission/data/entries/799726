HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Lewter is a 65-year-old gentleman with history of
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension ,
dyslipidemia , and peripheral vascular disease who presented to
Tci Prosamp Memorial Hospital on 5/1/06 with unstable angina. The patient
reports that he had been having intermittent left-sided chest
pressure at rest over the past three days associated with
shortness of breath , each episode lasting approximately 10
minutes. EKG on admission revealed sinus tachycardia with a new
incomplete left bundle-branch block and downsloping 1-1.5 mm ST
depressions in V3 through V6 and 1 mm depression in aVL. The
patient was deemed to have a NSTEMI and unstable angina. He was
not heparinized due to the fact that he was on Coumadin for
peripheral vascular disease with a therapeutic INR. On 9/18/06 , the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed the following: Left
circumflex coronary artery with an ostial 100% stenosis , left
anterior descending coronary artery with a proximal 60% stenosis
and a mid 50% stenosis , right coronary artery with a proximal 80%
stenosis and a mid 60% stenosis , right dominant circulation ,
ejection fraction of 30% , collateral flow from the second
diagonal to the third marginal in the right posterior left
ventricular branch to the second marginal , left ventricular
hypokinesis , severe inferior and apical.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
Significant for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 87 ,
troponin 0.48 , history of class IV angina with inability to carry
on any physical activity , history of class II heart failure with
slight limitation of physical activity , congestive heart failure ,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , dyspnea on exertion , hypertension ,
peripheral vascular disease , status post bilateral fem-pop bypass
and status post bilateral transmetatarsal amputations ,
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , history of
gastrointestinal bleeding , anxiety disorder , eosinophilia ,
chronic back pain , anemia.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION:
Lopressor 37.5 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg daily , Colace 100 mg
b.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg IV q.12h. , insulin sliding scale ,
atorvastatin 80 mg daily , glipizide , Avandia , Zestril , metformin ,
meclizine , lactulose , vitamin C , Protonix , Niaspan , Neurontin ,
Zincate , Coumadin for peripheral vascular disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Cardiac exam: Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , lifts or
heaves. Peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally in the
carotid , radial , femoral pulses and 1+ bilaterally in the
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses. Respiratory:
Breath sounds clear bilaterally. Allen's test of the left
upper extremity , abnormal intermittent waveform with radial
occluded using a pulse oximeter , right upper extremity
abnormal poor intermittent wave form with the radial occluded ,
also with a pulse oximeter. Physical exam otherwise is
noncontributory.
ADMISSION LABS:
Sodium 128 , potassium 4.2 , chloride of 99 , CO2 21 , BUN of 23 ,
creatinine 1.1 , glucose of 201 , magnesium 1.7 , WBC 5.81 ,
hematocrit 28.6 , hemoglobin 10.2 , platelets of 132 , PT of 18.2 ,
PT/INR 1.5 , PTT of 33.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. Jana was brought to the operating room on 7/28/06 where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x3 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery , a
sequential graft and a vein graft connecting from the aorta to
the second obtuse marginal coronary artery and then to the left
ventricular branch. Total bypass time was 55 minutes , total
crossclamp time was 46 minutes. The patient did well
intraoperatively , came off bypass without incident , was brought
to the Intensive Care Unit in normal sinus rhythm and in stable
condition. Postoperatively , the patient did well. His CK-MB
trended down and EKG normalized. The patient's postop chest x-ray
revealed moderate-to-severe pulmonary venous congestion bibasally
requiring vigorous pulmonary toilet. The patient was extubated on
10/3/06. The patient was also followed by the Diabetes Mellitus
Service for his non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. His
blood glucoses were well controlled. He was started back on his
oral medication of glipizide 5 mg and was covered with a NovoLog
sliding scale. The patient was transfused 3 units of packed red
blood cells postoperatively , and was re-started on Coumadin for his
peripheral vascular disease. The patient's platelet count
dropped to as low as 59 , 000. He had a HIT panel sent off which
came back negative and platelets trended up at time of discharge
to 143 , 000. Mr. Gier was transferred to the Step-Down Unit on
postoperative day #3. His pacing wires were removed , and he was
screened for rehabilitation for discharge. The patient also had
some urinary retention postoperatively and did require Foley
reinsertion and was started on Flomax 0.4 mg once a day. He
failed a second voiding trial and will be discharged with a leg
bag and follow up in the Urology Clinic in one week and continue
on his Flomax until that time.
DISCHARGE LABS:
The discharge labs for Mr. Howlingwolf were as follows: Glucose of
150 , BUN of 39 , creatinine 1.2 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.6 ,
chloride 103 , CO2 23 , magnesium 1.9 , WBC 8.6 , hemoglobin 11 ,
hematocrit 31.4 , platelets of 143 , PT of 17.1 , PT/INR of 1.4.
Urinalysis from 11/21/06 was negative. Urine culture is no
growth so far at time of discharge.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg QD , Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
while taking Dilaudid , Lasix 40 mg QD x3 doses , glipizide 5 mg
daily , Dilaudid 2-4 mg every three hours p.r.n. pain , lisinopril
