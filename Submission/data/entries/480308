HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Tijerino is a 63-year-old man with a
history of non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and chronic neck and shoulder pain
who presented with a near syncopal episode and a new left bundle
branch block on EKG. He has a history of intermittent episodes of
sudden onset of an ill defined , non-painful sensation that shoots
from the region of his left shoulder , up his left neck , and then
across his head bilaterally. The episodes are usually
instantaneous. He does not know how often he has them , but does
not think that he has had more of these episodes recently. He has
previously been worked up for chronic neck and left shoulder pain
that is attributed , in part , to a history of trauma. X-rays have
shown degenerative arthritis in the cervical spine , especially in
the region of C6 and C7 with evidence of foraminal narrowing and
nerve root impingement. He also has evidence of multiple
osteophytes in his cervical spine and in the region of his left
shoulder. He has had a normal head CT in 0/8 This pain has
been responsive to physical therapy and traction in the past.
Today , he had a similar such episode while turning his head to the
right while driving his car. The shooting sensation from his
shoulder up to his head was accompanied by a near loss of
consciousness and was followed immediately by flushing with
diaphoresis and then weakness and dizziness that persisted for
about 5-10 minutes. He did feel nauseated , but did not vomit. He
denied any chest pain , shortness of breath , or palpitations. He
pulled his car over to the side of the road and had his friend
drive him to TTFC. He continued to feel weak. He was noted at
TFHC to have a left bundle branch block on his EKG that was new
compared to an EKG obtained in 6/1 He was , therefore , referred
to Mibo Hospital for further evaluation and
management. On system review , he gives a history of dyspnea on
exertion and exertional fatigue with shortness of breath that is
relieved by rest. This has not changed recently and seems stable.
He also had stable three pillow orthopnea. He denied any
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or swelling of lower extremities. His
cardiac risk factors include diabetes mellitus , hypertension , a
positive family history , hypercholesterolemia , and he is a former
smoker.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ,
diagnosed in 1992 , last glycosylated
hemoglobin was was 12.7 in 3/23 2. Possible coronary artery
disease , last exercise tolerance test in 1/5 was without any
evidence of EKG changes. 3. Hypertension diagnosed in 1992. 4.
Hypercholesterolemia with baseline cholesterol 251 , LDL 175 , HDL
32 , and triglycerides 262. 5. Chronic neck and left shoulder pain
as above. 6. History of headaches , possible migraine headache
versus cluster headaches. 7. Probable gastroesophageal reflux
disease by history. 8. History of a right sided pneumonia and
empyema status post right sided chest tube four weeks , now with
chronic pleural changes. 9. Benign prostatic hypertrophy , last PSA
was 2.88 in 3/23 10. Impotence , normal prolactin and
testosterone levels. 11. History of balanitis. 12. History of
psoriasis.
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.day. 2.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.day. 3.
Aspirin. 4. Terazosin 2 mg p.o. q.day. 5. Zantac 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. 6. Ativan p.r.n. 7. Percocet p.r.n.
ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY: Notable for coronary artery disease in his
father who died of a myocardial infarction at age
66. There is no family history of diabetes mellitus or
hypertension.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a retired custodian. His wife died
in the last year , just after having undergone a
coronary arterial bypass graft. He has three children who lives in
the area. He claims he quit smoking in 1990 after a 40 pack year
history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature was 98.5 , heart rate between
90 and 100 , blood pressure 144/96 ,
respiratory rate 16 , and oxygen saturation 95% on two liters by
nasal cannula. He appeared to be a middle aged man who was
comfortable lying in bed. HEENT examination was notable for a 5 mm
nodule on the palpebral margin of his right upper eyelid. Sclera
were anicteric. Pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles were intact. Oropharynx was without any
evidence of lesions or without any adenopathy or masses. There was
no jugular venous distention apparent and no bruits heard. His
neck was nontender to palpation. His back was nontender to
palpation. No muscle spasm was palpable. His lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. His heart rate sounded somewhat fast ,
but was regular. His heart sounds were distant with an indistinct
first heart sound , but a second heart sound without evidence of
splitting. No S3 was heard. There was a question of a fourth
heart sound. There was also question of a grade I/VI systolic
murmur at the left sternal border and apex. He had good radial and
dorsalis pedis pulses. His abdomen appeared obese with active
bowel sounds. It was soft and nontender. His liver span was
estimated at 6 cm by percussion. He did not have any splenomegaly.
His stool was heme occult negative. Extremities were without any
evidence of cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. His skin was warm and
moist without any lesions. Neurologic examination showed an alert
and oriented man with fluent speech and 5/5 motor strength in his
upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. His touch
sensation was intact in his lower extremities bilaterally. He had
normal biceps and patellar deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. His
toes were downgoing on Babinski's test bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA: Electrolytes were within normal limits with BUN
24 and creatinine 1.2. Serum glucose was 204.
His white blood cell count was 7 , 900 , hematocrit 42% , and platelets
282 , 000. His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times
were normal. His liver function tests were normal. His
cholesterol was 227 with triglycerides 311. His cardiac troponin
was 0.0. EKG , on admission , showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 30
with the left bundle branch pattern that was new compared with an
EKG from 6/1 His axis and intervals were normal. A chest x-ray
demonstrated a right lower lobe opacity and bilateral pleural
thickening , no acute infiltrate , and no evidence of congestive
heart failure.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The etiology of his symptoms was unclear , but he
was admitted to rule out myocardial infarction ,
given the fact that he had a left bundle branch block pattern on
his EKG that was new compared to a previous EKG. It was not known
whether this new EKG finding was acute or whether this had occurred
sometime between 5/23 and the present time. He was started on
heparin for the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. He
was maintained on aspirin and started on a beta blocker. His
hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. He was started on
simvastatin given his hypercholesterolemia. He ruled out for an
acute myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes. He had an
echocardiogram on 9/30/96 which demonstrated borderline left
ventricular hypertrophy with low normal systolic function and an
estimated ejection fraction of 45%-50%. No regional wall motion
abnormalities were noted. He had mild left atrial enlargement ,
mild mitral regurgitation , and mild tricuspid regurgitation. A
Holter monitor on 9/30/96 showed a predominant rhythm of normal
sinus rhythm with a few atrial premature beats and ventricular
premature contractions. There was no evidence of high grade
ventricular ectopy. Because of his uninterpretable EKG , he
underwent exercise testing with MIBI imaging on 7/6/96. He
exercised for 6 minutes on a standard Bruce protocol. This was
discontinued due to fatigue. His heart rate increased from
baseline 58 to a peak of 94 , and his blood pressure changed from
130/60 at rest to 140/50 at peak. His peak rate pressure product
was 13 , 200. His EKG was notable for left bundle branch pattern
with 1 mm ST depressions. MIBI imaging demonstrated small apical
and septal rift consistent with mild ischemia. Because he remained
asymptomatic , and because his exercise test was without evidence of
large areas of myocardium at risk , he was discharged home on
7/6/96. He will follow up with his cardiologist for further
evaluation as indicated. His medication regimen was optimized
during his hospital stay.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.day. 2. Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.day. 3.
Hytrin 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. 4. Glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 5 mg

p.o. q.day. 7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually q.5 minutes as
needed for chest pain.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: He was discharged home on a low
cholesterol , low saturated fat diet.
FOLLOW-UP: He will follow up with his primary physician and
cardiologist in the next week.
