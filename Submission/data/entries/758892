the past two months , decreased energy ,
shortness of breath on climbing one flight of stairs. Pain in legs
with exercise. Recent polyuria , polydipsia , and noted blood on the
underwear in the distant past , believed it to be hemorrhoids.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission. VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile ,
temperature 98.2 , heart rate 97 , blood
pressure 140/88 , respirations 18 , oxygen saturation 99% on room
air. GENERAL: Obese , middle-aged woman in no acute distress.
HEENT: PERRL. EOMI. Oropharynx clear. Moist mucous membranes.
Positive upper dentures. NECK: No LAD , thyroid not palpable.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: S1S2 , no
murmurs , rubs or gallops. JVP at 8.0 cm. ABDOMEN: Soft ,
nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds , no
hepatosplenomegaly , no masses. EXTREMITIES: Tender , 3.0 cm , firm
mobile , nonfixed , nonerythematous question flocculent mass in her
left groin without associated lymphadenopathy. She did not have
palpable lower extremity pulses , though her extremities were warm
with less than 2 second capillary refill. NEURO: Alert and
oriented x 3. Cranial nerves intact. 5/5 strength bilaterally
upper and lower extremities. Sensation grossly intact upper and
lower extremities , thought some subjective altered sensation in the
lower extremities bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: A 48-year-old female with a long history of poorly
controlled insulin-dependent diabetes , initially admitted
for an I&amp;D left vulvar abscess , control of her diabetes in the
setting of infection , though she developed acute pulmonary edema
after being on the insulin drip and ultimately had a cardiac workup
which revealed severe left systolic dysfunction with an EF of 30%
and a 2-3 coronary vessel disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Infectious Disease: She had a vulvar
abscess , received gentamicin ( dosing per levels )
and clindamycin for the duration of her hospital course. Her
cultures revealed 1+ vaginal flora , anaerobic culture revealed
bacteroides , pepto Strep and Propionibacterium. She is status post
an I&amp;D of the vulvar abscess on hospital day #2 which throughout
the hospital course showed no signs or symptoms of further
infection and the plan is for her to follow up with Dr. Prive as an
outpatient and for her to go home on clindamycin to complete a
fourteen-day course.
2 ) Diabetes mellitus: On admission her finger sticks were 600.
She at that time received a 15 unit bolus with subsequent insulin
drip until the OR. She transitioned to subcu insulin on hospital
day #3 and when her diet returned she returned to NPH similar to
home dosing of 50 b.i.d. and Regular 14 moved up to 17 units b.i.d.
with a sliding scale to cover. Her sugars were in the high
100s-low 200s on this regimen. Her discharge sugars were about the
same and she was discharged on her original outpatient dose of
70/30 70 units b.i.d.
3 ) Cardiopulmonary: On hospital day #1 the patient started with
complaints of cough and shortness of breath with sort of a
plus/minus response to nebs , given her history of asthma and
smoking. She had a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary edema with
small effusions which was felt to be due to the fluid from the
insulin drip. She had an EKG with a left bundle branch block which
was new from an EKG in 2000. She then was placed on a rule out
protocol with flat enzymes. An echocardiogram that revealed a 30%
ejection fraction , global hypokinesis , moderate to severe decrease
in systolic function , moderate MR , trace TR. She underwent an
adenosine MIBI stress test to show a small reversible perfusion
defect ( diagonal coronary artery distribution ) , severe global
hypokinesis. She was placed on aspirin and simvastatin ( LDL 160s ) ,
Lopressor , and Captopril. She was diuresed with Lasix IV. She
underwent a cardiac catheterization on March which revealed LAD
long 80% stenosis , 50% RCA stenosis , and a pulmonary wedge pressure
of 27. A coronary artery bypass graft was recommended by
cardiology and after a family meeting they decided on discharge
with follow up for CABG decision and planning.
4 ) GI: Low salt fluid restricted diet in-house and started on
Nexium for a history of gastritis.
5 ) Renal: BUN and creatinine was turning upward after the
titration of her ACE inhibitor , this was monitored and stabilized.
6 ) Pulmonary: Pulmonary wedge pressure of 27 , the patient with
pulmonary hypertension likely due to left volume overload. She was
going home with Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. and lisinopril 20 b.i.d.
The discharge plan was for her to be discharged medically optimized
for cardiac surgery , if she makes the decision to go in that
direction. She has follow up appointments with both her primary
care physician Dr. Harland Isaman and GYN Dr. Shewbridge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Clindamycin 300 mg q.i.d.; simvastatin 20
mg q.d.; lisinopril 20 mg b.i.d.; atenolol
25 mg q.d.; Lasix 40 mg q.d.; aspirin 325 mg q.d.; insulin 70/30 70
units b.i.d. subcu.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP: Dr. Brehony , for her to call and make an
appointment in two weeks. Primary care
physician Dr. Loren Stivason , make an appointment within one week.
