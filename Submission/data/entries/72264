Discharge Date: 9/28/2001
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE , ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS: Hypertension , non insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , and
coronary artery disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old Spanish
speaking male with multiple cardiac
risk factors and extensive cardiac history including a
long-standing history of hypertension , non insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus since 1995 with hemoglobin AIC of 10.5 on
2/24/01 , 20 pack year smoking history and family history
significant for MI in his brothers at age 46 and 50 and history of
hyperlipidemia. The patient had his first MI in 1990 complicated
by congestive heart failure. An echocardiogram at an outside
hospital revealed EF of 22% with a dyskinetic apex and a dilated
left atrium. In November of 1995 , he had another MI , was
hospitalized at Sterrice where he required
intubation secondary to pulmonary edema. In May of 1995 , he
was admitted again for congestive heart failure and an
echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 25 to 30% , anterior and
anterolateral hypokinesis , moderate inferior and mild septal
hypokinesis and mild MR. Cath. in 1995 showed three vessel disease
and the patient underwent four vessel CABG in March of 1996 with
saphenous vein graft to the PDA , OM1 and OM3 and a LIMA to the LAD.
During the surgery , the patient had an ICG placed prophylactically
as part of the CABG patch study. Since the surgery , he has had
additional episodes of congestive heart failure with report of a
hospitalization in July 2000 in Ox News The patient
reports he was hospitalized at that time for difficulty breathing
and a third MI. He required intubation during this hospitalization
and the course apparently was complicated by renal failure. Since
July 2000 , the patient has reportedly felt well with no difficulty
breathing or chest pain. More recently , two months prior to
admission , the patient was found to have atrial flutter. He was
started on 80 mg of sotalol and his arrhythmia spontaneously
converted. Today , the patient presented to his
electrophysiologist , Dr. Handelsman for routine interrogation of his
pacemaker and was found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular rate in the 120s. Additionally , the patient reports
worsening lower extremity edema bilaterally for the past six days
and decreased urine output. The patient denies chest pain ,
shortness of breath. He has had no palpitations , diaphoresis ,
nausea , vomiting. He denies dietary indiscretion or any medication
changes. He has had no fever , dysuria or cough. He has stable two
pillow orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion but no paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. His most recent echocardiogram was in July of
2000 which showed a dilated left ventricle with EF of 15 to 20% and
global hypokinesis. The right ventricle was moderately enlarged
with depressed function. He had a thickened aortic valve and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. He had mild MR with an
enlarged left atrium at 5.7 cm.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As stated , hypertension , diabetes ,
hyperlipidemia , coronary disease and
congestive heart failure.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Isordil 10
mg p.o. t.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg q. day ,
Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d. , Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q. day , Lasix 80 mg
p.o. b.i.d. , Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. h.s. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.
day , and Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q day.
Of note , upon further questioning , it turns out the patient had
been taking amiodarone and had only been started on sotalol briefly
but became hypotensive with that and so he was switched to
amiodarone.
ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He has a 20 pack year history of smoking and
currently continues with binge drinking of greater
than four whiskey drinks at a time. He lives in News Ale with
his wife and children and he has not had work since his CABG.
FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for coronary artery disease in both
his brothers at age 46 and 50.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: Temperature 95.5 , blood pressure 120/80 ,
heart rate 80 to 120 , oxygen saturation 95% on room
air. GENERAL: This is a 59-year-old male male , well nourished in
no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic. Pupils are equal , round
and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Oral
mucosa is moist. Enlarged bilateral submandibular glands. NECK:
No lymphadenopathy or tenderness. JVP at about 9 cm. LUNGS:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or rales.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic , irregularly irregular with normal S1 ,
S2 and 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. ABDOMEN:
Soft , moderately distended , non-tender. Incisional scars noted
ventrally and centrally. There is no shifting dullness.
EXTREMITIES: 2 to 3+ pitting edema to mid thigh with notable
scrotal edema. 2+ femoral pulses appreciated on the right. Pedal
pulses not appreciated though. Tibial pulses not appreciated.
Lower extremities were warm to touch. NEURO: Grossly nonfocal.
ADMISSION LABORATORY: Sodium 137 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 98 ,
bicarbonate 28 , BUN 34 , creatinine 1.8 and
glucose of 146 , calcium of 10.2. White blood cell count is 6.5 ,

181 , T. bili. 1.7 , total protein 8 , albumin 4.7.
EKG shows an irregular rhythm , atrial fibrillation at a rate of
approximately 100 to 110 , no LDH , no RVH , and no acute ST , T wave.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , small pleural effusion , and
pulmonary vascular distribution and mild interstitial edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to cardiology service
for rate control and diuresis. He remained in
atrial fibrillation throughout the hospital course with rates
between 60 and 100. His Digoxin was continued and a low dose of
Lopressor 6.25 b.i.d. was started for rate control. The patient
ruled out for MI with CKs of 18 and 124 and Troponin of 0.06. He
was diuresed with IV Lasix that was titrated up to a dose of 200 mg
IV b.i.d. proceeded by 500 mg of Diuril b.i.d. Over the course of
the hospitalization , the patient's fluid status was negative 7.5
liters with marked improvement in his lower extremities edema. His
weight at discharge was 88 kg which is baseline per the patient.
He was restarted on his amiodarone 200 mg daily and an
echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated 4+ MR and TR , and an
EF of 15 to 20%. This was similar to an echocardiogram from
July of 2000. The patient will follow-up with Dr. Marc R Bessick on August and Dr. Eloy Williamston on June for
consideration of electrical cardioversion. He will also continue
on oral Lasix , Zaroxolyn and Coumadin as well as his previously
stated outpatient medications.
