ATTENDING: LOBUR , RENALDO MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease with myocardial
infarction.
OTHER DIAGNOSES:
1. CAD.
2. Hypertension.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Diabetes.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Peripheral vascular disease.
7. Smoking history.
8. History of alcohol abuse.
9. History of seizure disorder.
10. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Mauras is a 72-year-old man with
history of CAD status post CABG , PCI with history of stable
angina , type 2 diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , former
smoking history and also history of seizure disorder with
cataracts and recently discharged after an admission for atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He had occasional
anginal symptoms prior to discharge. He took about two
nitroglycerins per week. Over the past week , he had escalating
chest pain requiring one nitroglycerin per day. The pain was
relieved by rest and nitroglycerin. One week prior to admission ,
his digoxin was stopped and his amiodarone was decreased. His
Plavix was stopped and his Coumadin was held. On the morning of
admission , he had chest pain. He had two nitroglycerins and
rested but the pain persisted. He was taken to the ED. In the
ED , he received Lopressor , Enalapril , Lovenox treatment dose and
a Plavix load.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes CAD , hypertension , CHF , diabetes ,
hypercholesterolemia , peripheral vascular disease and past
smoking history.
ALLERGIES: To penicillin.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for past alcohol and smoking
history. He quit alcohol 25 years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Significant for afebrile , heart rate 45
and blood pressure 95/50. He had a left surgical pupil , left eye
ptosis at baseline. His heart had no murmurs , rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear. His abdomen was soft , nontender and
nondistended. He had bilateral femoral bruits , 2+ distal pulses.
No pronator drift.
LABS: Significant for hematocrit baseline at 30 to 32 , white
count of 13. His troponin peaked at 6.4.
EKG showed ST depressions in V3 through V6 that were new.
Echocardiogram on 8/11/05 showed an EF of 25 to 30% with septal
akinesis lateral and posterior hypokinesis and mild tricuspid
regurgitation.
Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospital course for this 72-year-old man with
non-ST-elevation MI.
1. Cardiovascular: A catheterization on hospital day 1 showed
four-vessel disease. No intervention was taken at that point , as
it was unclear which region was the culprit. Afterwards , he was
in hypotensive respiratory distress , likely secondary to flash
pulmonary edema. He received Lasix and morphine and he was
started on a nitro drip with improvement in symptoms. He was
found to have flash pulmonary edema and in atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response. He was taken back to the
catheterization lab and given four stents to his saphenous vein
graft , OM1 with good resolution of his symptoms and he went to
the CCU afterwards. On hospital day 3 , he was transferred to the
floor and was given an amiodarone load given his ejection
fraction and increased ectopy on telemetry. His troponin had
been trended down to the 0.2s by discharge. His beta-blocker and
ACE inhibitor were titrated to heart rate and blood pressure.
Prior to anticipated discharge , he re-developed flash pulmonary
edema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Electrophysiology consult evaluated him and based on
his prior ejection fraction symptoms , it was decided to place a
dual-chamber pacemaker with AICD. He has had no respiratory
events since that placement. He has remained in atrial
fibrillation and was re-loaded with digoxin. He was started on
his Coumadin two days prior to discharge and was not yet
therapeutic. His repeat echo did show an EF of 55%. This was
after the pacemaker was placed.
2. Renal: He has chronic renal insufficiency. He was given
Mucomyst precath with good effect. His creatinine on discharge
was 1.1 and he was making urine.
3. GU: He has had some symptoms of urinary retention with
difficult-to-place Foley. He was started on Flomax with good
effect. His prostate was not overtly large on exam. His PSA was
within normal limits.
4. Endocrine: He is a type 2 diabetic. His home dose of
metformin was held. He was continued on Lantus with sliding
scale insulin.
5. Hematology: His hematocrit was transiently down to 24. When
transferred out of the CCU , he was given three units of packed
red blood cells given his history of CAD. Since this , his
hematocrit has been stable in the 30-to-32 range. An abdominal
CT did not show any evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. His groin
had only a very small hematoma. His stool guaiac was only trace
positive.
DISPOSITION: He was discharged home in stable condition with VNA
services. He will follow up with his PCP on 4/7/05 , with Dr.
Wicinsky on 7/8/05 , and he should have his INR checked on
8/4/05 or 7/8/05 and Coumadin adjusted accordingly.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: His physical exam on
discharge was largely unchanged , afebrile and hemodynamically
stable. He had now a pacemaker placed over the left chest.
Incision looked clean , slightly tender to palpation. He had no
murmurs or rubs , no pedal edema. His chest was clear.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
2. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.
3. Librium 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Colace 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.

6. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Nitroglycerin one tab p.o. q.5 minutes p.r.n. chest pain.
8. Dilantin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Senna two tabs p.o. b.i.d.
10. Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.p.m.
11. Lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily.
12. Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. daily.
13. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.
14. Lantus 14 units subcutaneous at nighttime.
15. Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
16. Ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.
17. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily.
18. Enalapril 10 mg p.o. daily.
19. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
He was discharged home with VNA services.
FOLLOW-UP: He has follow-up appointments with his PCP , Dr. Santos Ciliberto at Mira Health on 11/8/05 , with Dr. Kelley Hernon of
Electrophysiology 0/7/05 at 3 p.m. and Dr. Daft 9/20/05
scheduled.
He will have his INR drawn on 8/4/05 with follow-up INRs to be
drawn every seven days and Coumadin adjusted accordingly.
