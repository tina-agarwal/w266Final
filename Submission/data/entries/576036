course include colonoscopy. No other procedures were performed.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: In brief , the patient is an
82-year-old woman with a history of insulin dependent diabetes
and hypertension who is in her usual state of health until the
morning of presentation when she was sitting at breakfast she
felt an increased in drowsiness and faintness with gradual onset
over ten minutes while seated. She felt as if she was going to
collapse but had no visual or motor deficit. She called her
daughter. Per report , the patient experienced no dysarthria or
confusion , no focal motor deficit. She stood and walked outside
noting no changes with standing. She denies fall or loss of

to her primary care physician in the past for symptomatic
bradycardia for which her medication regimen has been repeatedly
changed. Of note , she was recently started on Clonidine for her
hypertension.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is notable for
insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension , a history of a urinary
tract infection in the past , bradycardia , chronic edema in her
legs , obstructive sleep apnea. She has a history of a positive
PPD. She is allergic to Lisinopril which gives her angioedema as
well as CT contrast dye.

liver is appreciated. Extremities are warm and well perfused
with 3+ edema to the knees. She is alert and oriented x3. Her
reflexes are 2+ bilaterally , 5/5 strength in bilateral upper and
lower extremities. Her cranial nerves are all intact.
ADMISSION LABS: Admission labs are notable for a hematocrit of
35.8 , a BUN of 21 , and a creatinine of 1.4 which is essentially
at the patient's baseline. The patient had three sets of cardiac
enzymes which were all negative for ischemia. She had blood
cultures drawn which have returned no growth to date. Her TSH at
time of admission was 2.55 within the range of normal. Chest
x-ray showed low lung volumes , cardiomegaly without effusion or
consolidation. EKG was sinus rhythm 40 bpm , no Q waves , no T
wave inversions , no new ST segment elevation or depression. Her
QT corrected is 431 milliseconds. She had an echo March ,
2004 showing an ejection fraction of 65% and normal valves.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. Cardiovascular: The patient was admitted for workup and
treatment of her symptomatic bradycardia. On reviewing the
patient's past medical records , it was noted that she had
experienced similar symptoms with episodes of bradycardia related
to medications in the past. She was noted to be on atenolol
which had been a longstanding medication for her as well as
Clonidine which had only been started in the preceding 2-3 days.
Atenolol was discontinued at the time of admission as it had
nodal blocking properties. Additionally , Clonidine was also
discontinued for its potential rare adverse reaction of causing
bradycardia and at times heart block. Her heart rate gradually
improved over the course of her admission and by the time of
dictation her heart rate ranged from 60-75 at rest. The patient
was evaluated while inhouse. The patient had no loss of
consciousness , anginal chest symptoms or worsening of her
hypertension during this period. She was evaluated by the
Cardiology Service at Peley Memorial Health on the day
following admission who found the patient likely not to require
pacemaker. The recommendation of the Cardiology Service
additionally recommended to hold Clonidine and consider
restarting atenolol at a low dose of 25 mg p.o. daily. The
patient was subsequently re-evaluated by the Electrophysiology
Service at the Tu Chihar Hospital which assessed the
patient to likely not require a pacemaker given her improvement
of her bradycardia with the discontinuation of her nodally active
medications. The patient was maintained on telemetry over the
course of her hospitalization with no new or dangerous
arrhythmias noted. In terms of ischemia , the patient had a
negative workup for cardiac ischemia by enzymes x3 and had no
further anginal symptoms or changes in her EKG to indicate
myocardial ischemia or infarction. In terms of her pump
function , the patient was assessed to be volume up at the time of
admission and treated with one dose of Lasix 40 IV. She was
subsequently continued on her outpatient dose of Lasix 40 p.o.
and will be discharged on Lasix 40 p.o. b.i.d. She was noted to
have some improvement in her lower extremity edema over her
hospital course but it was assessed to be chronic and likely not
an issue to be further assessed by her outpatient physician. In
summary , the patient will be discharged to home without further
use of atenolol. The recommendation of the hospital team is that
the patient continue on her discharge medications for
hypertensive control. These will be Avapro 75 mg p.o. b.i.d. as
well as Norvasc 10 mg daily. It is recommended that if the
patient has poorly controlled hypertension as an outpatient , she
will undergo a trial with an agent that has no activity at the
sinoatrial node. Our recommended agent would be doxazosin. If
the patient continues to have bradycardia related to medications
and is unable to have her hypertension controlled by medications
that do not cause bradycardia , she may need to be re-evaluated by
the electrophysiology service for placement of a pacemaker. At
this time though , there is no recommended electrophysiologic
workup remaining for the patient.
2. Gastrointestinal: At the time of admission , the patient had
a known history of diverticulosis by colonoscopy as well as
barium enema , but had no history of acute bright red blood per
rectum. She suddenly developed acute bleeding from her rectum on
the evening of June , 2005 to a volume of approximately 1.5
- 2 liters. The patient was clearly orthostatic and unable to
stand without dizziness. She had no pain with this bleeding and
had no evidence of hematemesis. The patient was transfused to a
total of four units of packed red blood cells with her hematocrit
stabilizing in the low 30s following a drop to 28.8. She was
evaluated by the Gastroenterology Service at Nawsum Medical Center Of who took the patient to colonscopy on January . She
was found on colonoscopy to have nonbleeding diverticuli as well
as evidence of fresh blood in the sigmoid colon. The diagnosis
was thus made that the patient had had a sigmoid diverticular
bleed but was currently stable hemodynamically. The patient was
also assessed by surgery who felt the patient not to be an urgent
surgical candidate but recommended nasogastric lavage if the
patient were to rebleed and further consultation with surgery in
that event. The patient was observed to be hemodynamically
stable over the remainder of her hospitalization with no evidence
of drop in blood pressure or new blood per rectum. Her
hematocrit remained stable in the range of 30 at time of
discharge. She is recommended to follow up with her primary care
physician for observation and is instructed to return to the
Emergency Department immediately if there are any signs of
gastrointestinal bleeding and either vomiting of blood or blood
in her stool. She is maintained on Nexium for gastrointestinal
prophylaxis over her course.
3. Endocrine: The patient has a known history of insulin
dependent mellitus and she was maintained on NPH insulin at a
dose of 10 units subcutaneously b.i.d. following blood sugars
which was reduced from her outpatient dose following blood sugars
in the range of 50-60 on day of admission. She was also
maintained on an insulin sliding scale. During her
hospitalization , the patient's history of refractory hypertension
was concerning for the possibility that she may have some degree
of underlying renovascular hypertension. She has subsequently
underwent a secondary hypertension workup which included an a.m.
cortisol level which was 10.8 which was in the low range of
normal. She had an aldosterone level which was 2.8 which was low
and a plasmin renin activity 0.1 which is low. She completed a
24 hour urine collection and the urine levels of cortisol
metanephrines and normetanephrines are still outstanding. It is
recommended that she follow up these levels with her outpatient
physician. As stated above , the patient's blood pressure was
well controlled on Norvasc and Avapro and on the morning of
dictation her systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg.
4. Musculoskeletal: Beginning on March , the patient began
to complain of bilateral foot cramps worse in the plantar aspect
of her foot but also on the dorsum of her foot which were
exacerbated by dorsi and plantar flexion. She also described
vague pain in her right lateral calves. She subsequently
underwent lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound studies which
demonstrated no evidence of venous clots in either of her legs.
On exam , her legs demonstrated no tenderness to palpation over
her major joints and no evidence of frank inflammation. She was
assessed to likely have plantar fasciitis on the basis of
examination. The case was discussed with Rheumatology who
recommended Tylenol as well as hot or cold packs. The patient
subsequently received these treatments with improvement of her
symptoms. At the time of discharge though she continues to have
some left foot pain and Rheumatology has been consulted to
evaluate the patient more fully. Their recommendations are
pending at time of dictation. The patient complained of
difficulty walking secondary to this bilateral foot pain and will
be discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further care.
5. Infectious disease: The patient had a urinalysis at the time
of admission as well as blood cultures , both of which were
negative. Her chest x-ray at time of admission was without
infiltrate.
6. ENT: The patient was continued on her Flonase at her
outpatient dose , stable without new complaints at time of
dictation.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on Lovenox for DVT
prophylaxis which was subsequently discontinued following her
diverticular bleed. She is maintained on Nexium for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis. She will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility in stable condition.
FOLLOW UP PLAN: Follow up plan for her is with her primary care
physician , Dr. Ernzen Dr. Spulick is advised to follow the
patient's urinary cortisol as well as her 24 hour urine
metanephrines and normetanephrine levels. It is recommended that
he continue to follow his hypertension closely as he has been and
use whenever possible agents without sinoatrial nodal activity.
Recommended next agent if the patient continues to have
refractory hypertension would be doxazosin. The patient is
advised to pursue a high fiber diet in the context of her
diverticulitis and is advised to return to medical care
immediately if there are any new signs of gastrointestinal
bleeding or vomiting of blood. Again , the patient is not
assessed to be a candidate for a pacemaker at this time due to
the likely medication related bradycardia that she experienced
although she continues to have new symptomatic bradycardia. It
is recommended that she return for re-evaluation to the
Electrophysiology Service. She is recommended to follow up with
physical therapy as an inpatient at a rehabilitation facility and
then follow up with Podiatry if indicated. Please note the
patient's NPH insulin dosing was decreased from her outpatient
level from 20 to 14 units subcutaneously b.i.d. given the
patient's episodes of hypoglycemia on the day of admission during
which she was receiving 20 units subcutaneously. It is advised
that her rehabilitation facility check daily fingersticks with
meals and adjust her NPH dosing as appropriate.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Discharge medications will include Colace
100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , NPH insulin 14 units
subcutaneously b.i.d. , Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily , Flonase 1-2
sprays daily , Avapro 75 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h.
