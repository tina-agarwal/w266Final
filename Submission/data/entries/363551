************** Hospital Course***************
1 ) ISCHEMIA: pt with prior CAD/stent , likely angina 2nd to demand
ischemia on decompenasted HF. cont meds , pt not on Plavix on
admission. Doubt primary angina as couse of CHF/RHF.
2 ) PUMP: Pt with ?dyastolic HF with
acute decomp/exacerbation ( with dietary
indiscretion )- as well as renal failure as poss source of
volume overload. Change to IV lasix 100 BID and
strict I/Os , weights. March Pt has responded to BMP diuresis in past.
Restarted here on BMP w/ limited response. Pt achieved -500 ml qd but
continued to have weight gain. I suspect that fluids were not being acc
urately accounted for. At this time patient is no longer being effect
ively diuresed and will require dialysis for volume overload in a
short period of time.
3 ) RHYTHM: No signs of arhtymias
4 ) RENAL: PT with stage 4 CRI and nephrotic
synd. May be volume overload 2nd to renal failure
in addition to CHF decomp/exacer. Cr. 4 at admission but elevated to
5.3. Given Pt's current condition , dialysis seems
imminent. March Pt went for vein mapping but pt remained uncertain if
he will accept dialysis as a treatment option. At time of d/c
creatnine now 5.0. Pt will have creatnine checked in 2 days and
called in to following physician. Will HD plan accordingly.
5 ) GI: GI bleed in past , Guaiac neg in ED
6 ) ENDO: DM2- will on 1/2 dose lantus in house with RISS , HA1C-5.7
subclinical hypothyroid , TSH-3.235
7 )HEME: microcytic anemia ? FE vs.
chronic disease , pt with transfusion from ED , unable
to send FE studies at this time. Started on Procrit per renal.
8 ) PSYCH: Bipolar d/o- cont meds
9 )Pt w/ poor ox sat- f/u CT for structural causes of poor
oxygenation.
