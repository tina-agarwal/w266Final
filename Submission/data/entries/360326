BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient was admitted to Thickua Medical Center surgery service on
11/29/2007 for preoperative evaluation/clearance. On 0/28 she was
taken to the operating room where she underwent debridement of her
non-healing left TMA site No concerning intraoperative events occurred;
please see dictated operative note for details. In the PACU she was
noted to be oozing from several points within the wound bed. Two silk
stitches were placed with improved hemostasis. On POD 1 , the oozing
continued and her hct had dropped to 21. She remained hemodynamically
stable but given her cardiovascular history she was transfused a total of
4 units of blood over the next 2 hospital days. Surgicell was also placed
into the wound bed with adequate hemostasis. The remainder of her
hospital course was unremarkable. Patient had adequate pain control and
was tolerating sips on POD0 and was advanced to regular diet by POD1.
She remained neurologically intact postoperatively. Her blood pressure
remained at baseline ( SBP 110-140s ). She was kept on perioperative
Vanc/Levo/Flagyl throughout her hospitalization. On POD 4 , she was
discharged to rehab in stable condition , afebrile , voiding independently ,
with adequate pain control. Her wound had areas of granulation; will
plan to continue wet-to-dry dressings with normal saline for gentle
debridement. Will reevaluate for VAC dressing and possible eventual skin
graft closure on follow up. She was given explicit instructions to
follow-up in clinic with Dr. Foderaro in 1 week.
