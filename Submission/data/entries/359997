tapering lesion of the left main coronary artery , 70% proximal
lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery , 80% lesion
distal to D1 , 100% occlusion of his left circumflex and a 100%
occlusion of his right coronary artery. He is admitted on January , 1999 for coronary artery bypass grafting.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Psoriasis and polymyalgia rheumatica ,
coronary artery disease and wide eye
glaucoma. His echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular
hypertrophy with a normal ejection fraction. He has a 45 year
history of smoking.

LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission revealed a BUN of 20 ,

HOSPITAL COURSE: On March , 1999 , he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times three with a left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior coronary artery ,
saphenous vein graft to the aorta and a saphenous vein graft from
the obtuse marginal to the aorta. His intraoperative course was
uncomplicated. On postoperative day number one , he was weaned to
extubation and he was treated with stress steroids to prevent
steroid withdrawal. On postoperative day number one , he was taken
back to the operating room for bleeding. After he was extubated ,
he was reintubated and was returned in good and stable condition to
the intensive care unit on renal Dopamine. He was again extubated
and was seen in consultation by the Gastrointestinal Service for a
question of gastrointestinal bleed since there was a clot seen on
the transesophageal echocardiogram probe at its withdrawal from his
first surgery. The Gastrointestinal Service saw any evidence of
any upper gastrointestinal bleed and he was maintained on H2
blockers. He was sent to the step down unit on routine
postoperative day number two and his Captopril was increased for
afterload reduction. His course improved and he was diuresed for a
volume overload still requiring oxygen supplementation on two
liters. His oxygen saturation was only 91% on postoperative day
number three. He continued to improve and continued to have care
for his respiratory situation with continued diuresis and nebulizer
treatments and ambulation. He was screened by rehabilitation and
awaited rehabilitation placement. He did acquire a rehabilitation
bed on postoperative day number six and he is being transferred to
rehabilitation on the following medications.
