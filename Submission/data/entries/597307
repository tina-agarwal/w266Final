None
BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
HPI: 77 yo woman with known CAD ( s/p 4 stents to LCX/LAD/RCA on two
separate occasions ) presents w/ the sudden onset of severe sharp chest
pain at 4AM on the day of admission which awoke her from sleep. Severe ,
L sided , worse w inspiration &amp; a/b nausea &amp; diaphoresis; no SOB. Pain
not initially relieved by nitro. Presented to ED where EKG was without
changes and enzymes neg but D Dimer elevated at 801. Cont'd to c/o chest
pain; heparin initiated , along w/ ASA/Plavix ( home dose ); found to have
HTN at SBP 235 b/l arms; In the emergency department , she was treated with
hydralazine , SL nitro , nitro drip and then pain free; given lopressor 25.
Admit for w/u of pain.

*****
A/P: 77F w ho CAD p/w chest pain of sudden onset: Original ddx includes
acs/usa/PE/hypertensive urgency or emergency/msk/chf. Given the excellenet
response to heparin and a negative cardiac catheterization , and the
continuoation of pain despite control of hypertension , the cardiac team
felt that the most likely diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism. However , had
neg lenis and PE CT , so unlikely PE. She was discharged home with follow up
with Dr. Sollitto and with her usual PCP. Will need monitoring of lytes and
Cr given possibility of contrast induced nephropathy in setting of
underlying elev Cr.
**CV: ( i ): Chest pain was initially concerning for ischemic pain;
however , cardiac catheterization was unchanged from prior cath. She
will continue asa/plavix/BB/statin; she ruled out for MI w serial
enzymes and ekgs. Given an intermediate to high probability story
and an intermediate V-Q scan , she was continued on heparin and PE protocol
CT of chest was obtained , which was neg for PE but showed a pulmonary
nodule; she will need repeat CT for nodule f/u in 6-12 months. Excellent
oxygentation , stable walking and nearly pain free at time of discharge.
( r ): no active issues , telemetry monitoring was nl.
( p ): HTN , w ss , uptitrated labetalol for BP.
**PULM: PE intermediate pretest prob - elev d dimer but no ekg changes , no
o2 req , no known ca , no obvious dvt risks. lenis negative , PE CT neg , so PE
considered unlikely , will not anticoagulate. Pulm nodule on CT , will need
6-12 month f/u scan. Of importance however , has
pulm hypertension that is new on R heart cath and given no other
explanation for sudden pressure changes ( impressively higher since last
cath ) , may have primary pulm HTN. Given ground glass in lungs and pulm
nodule , should have outpt pulm eval for pulm parenchymal disease in near
future.
**endo: DM on 70/30 at home. Poor control given HbA1c elev and high
finger sticks in house. Chgd to nph and short acting pre-meal insulin for
tight control. Pt agreed to incr freq of SC insulin for tight control ,
still high sugera in house. Wanted to send with NPH and short acting pre-meal
regimen but pt refused to change home regimen despite repeated explanations
of value of tighter control. Agreed that she would return to home regimen of
70/30 and f/u ASAP with Dr. Douglas Tippett of Endocrinology to optimize
insulin regimen; also should f/u with outpt pcp for titration. H/o
hypothyroidism. TSH elevated; gave script for
112 mcg of levoxyl ( an increase ) and contacted her o/p endocrinologist for
follow up.
**MSK: arthritis: oxycodone and tylenol prn
**FEN mag/k/calcium
**ppx: heparin while in house.
**Code status: FULL CODE
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Work with your VNA for aggressive diabetes management. Please assess
blood sugars and titrate insulin as per your doctor. Please assess blood
pressures as well. Check your electrolytes with VNA in 1 week.
Continue diabetes teaching. thank you
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Check Cr , lytes in 1 week by VNA given contrast load and risk of
nephropathy. Pulmonary consult to eval for primary pulm
disease. Repeat chest CT 6-12 months to f/u nodule.Titrate insulin by
finger sticks at PCP. Monitor BP.
